"I have had sleeping issues since a teenager and was finally diagnosed with Childhood Onset Insomnia. At times less than 1 hour total sleep a day for 3-4 days in a row. At the age of 42 my Dr prescribed Elavil (Amitriptlyne) and it changed my life. Its really cheap about $30 CDN per month, doesn&#039;t store in your fat cells and is non addictive. I take 50mg at around 9pm, fall asleep around 11 and get a great sleep straight through until 6-7am. No grogginess, some slight dry mouth. For me, it doesn&#039;t make me drowzy but it does help me stay asleep which was my problem- waking regularly through the night. Good, luck, hope it works for you as well as it has for me!"
