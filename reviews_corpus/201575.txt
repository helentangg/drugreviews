"I can remember being on this for just two months last year.  What did improve while I was taking it was my concentration--I started reading every book in sight.  I stopped taking the Zoloft because I thought it made me sick to my stomach and also gave me tics.  I guess I should have waited out the side effects because I thought my ability to read was fantastic."
