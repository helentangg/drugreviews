"I&#039;ve been on this medication before. For me is one of the best AD, helps with anxiety, and depression. It has a wide range in it&#039;s dosage, at 75mg works on serotonin, at 150mg starts the noradrenaline also to play a role, and at a dose of 300mg, they say there&#039;s a dopamine play too. I&#039;ve try the three doses, the best one for me is 150mg, more than that, I tend to be more anxious."
