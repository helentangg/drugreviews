"I have used every antidepressant on the market over the past 15 years, as well as having ECT treatments, for major depressive disorder, persistent anxiety disorder, and obsessive compulsive disorder.

I am just completing my first week of 10 milligrams per day, and I have already cut my Xanax dosage from 6 milligrams per day, down to 2 milligrams per day. I have not felt this good in years! And I have had ZERO side effects. I think the miracle I&#039;ve all been waiting for is here!"
