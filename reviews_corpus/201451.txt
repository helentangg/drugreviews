"I started taking zoloft about 5 months ago and it has totally changed my life for the better. The first 2 wks were a little rough ( increased anxiety ), but my Dr increased my ativan dosage until the zoloft started working. It took about 4-6 weeks to truly start working, but once it did it was a life saver. I&#039;ve had barely any anxiety and have been able to decrease my ativan slowly to 0.5mg per day. Would highly recommend this med for panic attacks and / or generalized anxiety disorder."
