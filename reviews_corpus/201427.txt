"I think zoloft for me is great. The only downfall i have with it was headaches. They started right when I began taking zoloft daily. They were intense and hurt like hell. Lasted about 2 weeks. Then bam they were gone. I took it at night before bed. I thought they made me tired. Since I&#039;ve been on it , I&#039;ve lost about 20lbs. I don&#039;t have the munchies at all &amp; honestly I have to tell myself to eat because it curbs my appetite. I don&#039;t feel bloated like I did on Lexapro that&#039;s why I switched. Zoloft really works for me and I&#039;m on a low dose. Headaches suck the first few weeks but what a difference from lexapro. Everyone&#039;s different."
