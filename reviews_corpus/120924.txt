"My doctor had me try several different meds for my panic disorder and depression and nothing worked except lexapro but I hated being on it because it ruined my sex life, gave me IBS, made me fat, and made me feel zombie like and the worst part is that the positive effects of the medicine would wear off within a few months and just leave me with all the bad side effects. I was finally about to give up on all medicine and just crawl under a rock for good when she said that there was a new version of Effexor that was extended release and getting good feedback. On just 75 mg a day, my life and turned around 360 degrees. No more bad anxiety and when I get an attack it&rsquo;s much more manageable. My orgasms have returned, losing weight, feel amazing!"
