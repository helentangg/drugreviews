"Had depression for almost 8 years - been on these tablets for about 3 years. 
Am on 150mg a day. On the plus side it does seem to work to a degree, although most of the time feel tired, don&#039;t sleep (even if I take them in the morning).
Side effects for these at these dosages and not good - hate the dry mouth, feeling tired and nausea - even though I train 4 days a week"
