"I&#039;ve been on Pristiq for about 2 yrs, started on 50mg but after a couple of months I started feeling very moody, Dr put it up to 100mg, again a few months later same thing happened, had it increased to 150mg, I&#039;ve been on this dose for over a year, Dr. never thought I would take this dose as I am small frame and only 55kg. I started taking it at night and found that my mind was going at a million miles an hr, did not sleep for a week, changed to the morning which works well. As others have mentioned, if I miss a dose I get dizzy. Pristiq has helped me, saved my marriage, and my life, I am calmer, anxiety gone, mood swings gone, suicidal thoughts gone. Give it time and if all else fails get help. Good luck!"
