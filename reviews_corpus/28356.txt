"I was started on Lexapro for Generalised Anxiety Disorder because the Xanax I&#039;ve been on for the past few years is now Schedule 8.  I have been on it for 10 days now and I hate the side effects so I will not be taking any more tomorrow.  I started out on 5mg for five days and felt nausea, intense headaches, excessive drowsiness, tremors and total lack of concentration.  Then I was advised to up the dose to 10mg and things are worse as I feel extremely anxious and haven&#039;t left the house all weekend.  Another side effect is extreme muscle jerking through the night.  Definitely not for me."
