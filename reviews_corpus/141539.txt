"I suffered from severe stress for months before I started having chest pains. This sent me to urgent care and then the ER the following day. Tests were fine. The chest pain persisted for weeks and then I developed pain under both ribs. I continued to have these symptoms for months before I developed an interior tremor and twitching in my left foot. Becoming obsessed with my health only caused the symptoms to worsen and visits to my gyno, neuro, and GI all proved nothing. After 6 months of unrelenting and worsening symptoms, the panic attacks began. At this point I was on the brink of a meltdown and spent much of my downtime in bed. At this point I visited the psych. Started Lexapro. Symptoms worsened initially. Three weeks later...CURED!"
