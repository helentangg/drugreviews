"So far, I&#039;ve only been on Lexapro for two days. I am finding that it is helping very much with my negative outlook on life, my mood swings, and my panic attacks/emotional fits. I find that little things like someone cutting me off or dropping something don&#039;t frustrate me as much or make me want to scream. I find that my voice is calmer and that I can have mature conversations with my partner without getting worked up. I have a better perspective on life already. I was on zoloft before and it did not do anything for me at all. It&#039;s so refreshing to see a change and I can&#039;t wait to see what else Lexapro does for me!

Negative side effects I&#039;ve experienced: headaches, stomach upset, dizziness. These are supposed to go away within a week."
