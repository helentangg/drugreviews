"This is the only antidepressant that was  beneficial to me. Following a steroid induced psychosis, I just was never the same. Terrible anxiety, up at night, deep depression every now and then. 
I will say that my sleep didn&#039;t fall into place until I was on the 20mg. 
I can&#039;t imagine life without this medicine!"
