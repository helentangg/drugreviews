"Having suffered with hypochondria, anxiety and depression for years I was at my wits end when I decided to try Sertraline. I can honestly say they have given me my life back. I&#039;ve NEVER, even as a child felt this calm and happy before. To anyone that&#039;s suffering I&#039;d say give them a try. Best thing I&#039;ve ever done."
