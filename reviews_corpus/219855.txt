"I have always suffered tiredness depression whenever I didn&#039;t get a good night&#039;s sleep. I was sent to a specialist re an unrelated matter with chronic sinusitis. He said he diagnosed myofascial disorder and prescribed Endep 10g and I couldn&#039;t believe the difference. No more waking up in a haze and feeling anxious. I have since had a difficult marriage break up to deal with and increased the dose to 25mg. I don&#039;t know how I would have coped without this drug. I hope to get back to the 10mg once I have my life back once settlement is done and I move on."
