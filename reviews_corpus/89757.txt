"I have been taking the 20mg Celexa for about 2 months now and just raised my dose to 40 mg. I really do feel so much better. I have the occasional mood swings but other then that I&#039;m not depressed or I haven&#039;t had any more panic attacks like I had previously before placed on it. I would say its doing the job. The only side effects would be trouble sleeping sometimes and constant sweating throughout the day, but it&#039;s been better lately."
