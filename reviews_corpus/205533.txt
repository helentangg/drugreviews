"I was suffering severe depression from a total inability to cope with a traumatic situation I had been through. Pristiq worked wonders the first couple of weeks. I was enjoying life again. Silly me, I didn&#039;t pay any attention to the side effect information. It all started with significant weight loss 25 lbs. I originally weighed 120lbs, then I stopped sleeping. I became panicked, one pupil became very dilated. Terrible situation."
