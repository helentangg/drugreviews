"I&#039;ve tried prozac, effexor, welbutrin and buspar. Cymbalta is the only med that makes me feel normal and cures my anxiety with no noticeable side effects. There is a withdrawal if I miss a dose and it involves being very sleepy,  vivid dreams and night sweats. It&#039;s not fun, but it&#039;s worth feeling normal again."
