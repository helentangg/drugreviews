"I am now on Day 14 of 20mg per day and every day has been awful.  Total fatigue, diarrhea, shaking body, horrible thoughts, lack of appetite, agoraphobia etc etc.  Sometimes around late afternoon into the evening I start to feel a little bit better.  I spoke to my doctor on Day 10 and he suggested taking the tablet at night.  I haven&#039;t managed to do that yet as I felt my body was craving the drug in the morning.  I have decided this morning to wait till night to take it.  I cannot help but think all of this is not worth it and I will never get any better."
