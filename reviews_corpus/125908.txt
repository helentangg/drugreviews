"I have been taking 20 mg of Viibryrd for 5 months. I titrated up very slowly and found that 30mg cause restless leg so I went back down to 20mg.  The side effects, like day time sleepiness and gastrointestinal annoyances must be worked through.  They pass.  My anxious depression has lifted and I feel better that I have felt in years.  In conjunction with the meds, I have continued to do depth psychology and psycho-spritual work which I think have also contributed to how well I feel.  People notice how bright I appear.  I am doing better than ever at work and still have energy to run my household. Recently, I was even able to return to the gym.  The only side effect I notice is gas and loose stools, a bit of bloat in the gut."
