"I usually have awful side effects from antidepressants, but did not have any with this one. So far Trintillex is the only antidepressant I have been able to tolerate. It allows me to function. I actually sing sometimes which was so rare for me. I cannot live without it. Unfortunately, it is expensive (even with insurance). I would give it a 10, but I have to pay so much money each month to get it."
