"Diagnosed with fibromyalgia in 1993 and tried lots of medicines. Lyrica was awesome, but became less effective after about 7 years and still had some level of pain and fatigue. Cymbalta has been fabulous. It took about 3 1/2 weeks for me to get over the side effects (restlessness, nausea, headache, jerkiness - especially at night with morning dosage), but now - I feel the best I had ever felt. My pain and fatigue are gone, and as an additional bonus, chronic low back and arthritis pain are gone too. I had no idea how much pain I had been in until Cymbalta took it away. Beware of withdrawal though. Head spins, jerkiness, &quot;brain shock&quot; when you move your eyes quickly, etc, very bad. Don&#039;t miss a dose or let the prescription run out by accident! Worth it to be pain free!"
