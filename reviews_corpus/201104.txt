"I developed a very specific form of OCD in my early 50&#039;s that is commonly described as &quot;Ear Worms&quot;.  It is where a song or a snippet of a song gets stuck in your head and keeps playing over and over.  It got so bad it was literally driving me insane.  I would have a snippet playing nonstop for WEEKS!  Day and night (kept me awake until I fell asleep from exhaustion).  Played at work CONSTANTLY where I couldn&#039;t focus.  I would be in meetings unable to pay attention because I would have a song blaring over and over in my head.  After ramping up doses, I settled at 100mg/day of Zoloft which has SAVED MY LIFE!  It works!  I can listen to music again and not yell at my wife when she sings.  And I have no side effects."
