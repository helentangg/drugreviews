"About four months ago my anxiety became very bad which eventually led to me becoming depressed. I spent my days in  bed, crying and anxious. I had to take time off work and my social life became non-existent. I was eventually put on Fluoxetine at 20mg and then eventually put on 40mg. The side effects I had was extreme tiredness, strange dreams and an increase in anxiety which went away after about four weeks so if you&#039;re having side effects hang in there as it can take anywhere from 4-8 weeks for this medication to work. My side effects went and three months after taking this medication I&#039;m a completely different person. I&#039;m motivated, my anxiety has eased so much and my depression has gone. It has given me my life back!"
