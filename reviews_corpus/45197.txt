"Been on this med for a year. Haven&#039;t ended up in the hospital since for panic disorder and depression. It makes my mood stable and gives me energy and motivation to live life. I&#039;m in my mid 20s and am lucky how much this drug has helped me. My anxiety and panic disorder can be frightening, plus the depression aspects can make for a scared and crying disaster. The negatives I&#039;ve had on this was when I first started I could not eat. But that side effect did go away after a few weeks. The other side effect is not being able to fall asleep without some sort of drug to slow my brain down. I&#039;ve been on a combination of mood drugs. I plan to stay on Prozac."
