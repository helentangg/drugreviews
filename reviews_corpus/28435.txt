"I was only on Lexapro for 2 weeks but in that time, I had a headache everyday, would get extremely tense muscles and the back of my neck, was very drowsy (took a few 2+ hour naps), felt dizzy (had some vertigo effects), couldn&#039;t focus on anything, and completely lost the ability to orgasm which caused my partner a lot of stress and made sex frustrating instead of enjoyable. I was on 5mg for a week then 10mg. It just wasn&#039;t worth it for me. I&#039;m now taking Wellbutrin SR and like it so far (only on my 3rd day)."
