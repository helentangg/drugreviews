"After I was diagnosed with Depression and Anxiety, I was prescribed Zoloft 50mg at first. Taking 25mg for a week, and slowly increasing to 50 mg, then 100mg. It was horrible. The first two weeks I ended up restless and could not sleep, I was also shivering and tense during the day. I was then prescribed Lexapro, which helped me get back to my normal sleeping schedule. It did help with my anxiety more, but it did not do much for my depression. My constant hopelessness went away, but I didn&#039;t really find the will to commit to goals, motivate myself, and just become more content. I&#039;m really just feeling like I&#039;m in the middle. It&#039;s been more than 7 weeks now on Lexapro and I might look to change to something different."
