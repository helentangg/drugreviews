"I was prescribed Cymbalta 60mg a day I take it in the evening to help with stress &amp; depression.  The side effects of dry mouth &amp; loss of appetite only lasted about a week and a half then subsided away.  My depression has been improving but I must say a big benefit for me also has been my back pain, that has had me almost crippling at times, is about non existent, which I realized must be from the Cymbalta.  Anyway so far so good."
