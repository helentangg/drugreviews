"FOR ANXIETY - I&#039;ve been on 30mg Celexa for years and am switching to Viibryd to try to get past the libido issues (i.e. lack thereof).  I was pretty nervous after reading all the reviews of side effects.  I started on 5mg (still on 30mg Celexa) with a bagel and cream cheese -- no side effects!   

It&#039;s weird to say this about an SSRI, but I almost immediately noticed a change in my anxiety.  Like, within a day.  I no longer am living &quot;in the future,&quot; very much more &quot;in the moment.&quot;  It&#039;s kind of bizarre.  So far so good!

Only side effect so far:  Foggy feeling the first day, but has improved since then."
