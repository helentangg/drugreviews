"Male, 52 years old, police officer, 6-0, 200lbs, been taking 20mg of Citalopram for 6 weeks now. I took 10mg for a month, but nothing good occurred. I suffered with moderate depression and anxiety, and am not sure which one came first. Very frustrating. But none the less, it finally seems to be showing a positive effect after about 6 1/2 weeks on the 20mg. Just when you think it&#039;s not helping and that it&#039;s a waste of time, it kicks in. Hard to explain the feeling, but you just start feeling better. My mind just stopped worrying about crap and I could relax more and have more positive thoughts. Over the last 13 years, I&#039;ve suffered off and on with this disorder and have taken Benzo&#039;s and other anti-depressants. Citalopram seems to help."
