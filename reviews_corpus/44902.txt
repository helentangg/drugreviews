"Ok so I also have depression, anxiety and body dismorphic disorder. I am a recovering alcoholic, and up until my last relapse I took Prozac. I then switched to Effexor (after being on Prozac for approx 8 years), and my compulsions went away! I only realized how compulsive Prozac makes me b/c I restarted it (as an add on) about 2 weeks ago. I haven&#039;t had thoughts (obsessions) about hair, makeup, alcohol, ANYTHING up until I restarted Prozac. I just figured this out, and I&#039;m blown away-- it explains so much of why I felt how I did all thru growing up, and the subsequent disorders I garnered. In me, it creates what feels like an itch inside my brain, and this itch latches on to something external (obsession). I try to wait it out, it (can&#039;t.)"
