"Effexor has finally made me feel like myself again... Can&#039;t remember the last time I was me, it&#039;s been at least 7 or 8 years. Tried Lexapro, Wellbutrin, Zoloft with no relief and bad side effects. Celexa worked so-so. Effexor has given me my motivation and happiness back. Only side effects for me are night sweats and slight headache/dizziness if I forget a dose...worth it in my opinion to be me again! Don&#039;t forget counselling/ therapy too... Didn&#039;t feel the most helpful most days (I cried every time I went) but I can tell my maladaptive thought patterns have changed."
