"Before Paxil I had used multiple medication for anxiety and depression and they would mellow me out but I didn&#039;t really feel &quot;better&quot;. After starting Paxil I can honestly say I&#039;m the happiest I have been in years and my coping skills are greatly improved. I feel healthy again, my appetite is back to normal, I don&#039;t look sickly anymore and I can sleep. Paxil was the miracle for me."
