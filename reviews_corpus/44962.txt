"I suffer from major depression/anxiety. I would cry, panic, and feel negative about everything. I tried Lexapro in my teens and it worked great for me. However, when it returned years later my doc suggested 20mg Prozac as it would be more &quot;energizing&quot;. The first 2-3 weeks were unpleasant side effects such as fatigue, increased anxiety, and insomnia. After the 3rd week up until the 5th week I did gradually feel better, I didn&#039;t cry or really feel depressed anymore. However, at the 6th week it seemed to stop working, I began to feel more anxious than depressed again, and felt very uneasy all the time, plus I experienced digestive issues. Also, I feel no more energized whatsoever. Prozac helped me somewhat, but it didn&#039;t really do it for me."
