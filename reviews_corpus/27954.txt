"I have been dealing with anxiety and depression off and on most of my life. I have never previously asked for help because I thought it was a sign of weakness.

Before I was waking up in tears, I was always angry, sure that everyone was judging me. It completely crippled me. I also was self-medicating with pot and with chocolate and my weight was ballooning.  I finally asked for help and started on a generic lexapro 10 mg - 2 weeks ago and it is like a miracle.

I&#039;m sleeping well, not a tear shed, losing weight, have lost interest in both chocolate and pot. I feel content and happy yet I still feel like me. I wish I had asked for help a long time ago. Life is good!"
