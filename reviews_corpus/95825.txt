"I took for 8 weeks, 53 year old male. I moved to a new town for job. It is pretty depressing when you don&#039;t know anyone. Zoloft 50 mg. First night NO sleep. Started taking  at night with Ambien. I sleep for about 5 hours then I&#039;m up at 3 am. Major side effects: inability to orgasm, clenched teeth, restless legs, trembling, loss of appetite, diarhea and sweating. First week was nausea, trembling but emotions were better. After 8 weeks, I think the side effects aren&#039;t worth the benefit. Quit cold turkey 4 days now. No major problems. Teeth clench still but, not as bad."
