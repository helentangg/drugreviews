"I have been on and off this drug for about 15 years now.  It is the only drug I have found that will slow my racing thoughts, and general anxiety disorder.  I was on Prozac when I was first diagnosed and that was a nightmare, I had no short term memory what so ever.  I have also tried Cymbalta and a few others none of them helping like the Effexor does.  I have taken myself off this medicine many times thinking I was better and didn&#039;t need it anymore just to come to the conclusion it was indeed the medicine making me feel normal.  I remember having side effects when I first started this medicine but they do subside."
