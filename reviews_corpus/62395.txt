"My experience has been good.  When I first started taking the medication, I did feel suicidal and extremely depressed. I pulled myself off of it after 2 days. I had a nervous breakdown, lost it for a couple days.

But after about a week I started to take the pill again and it has been wonderful. I only take 10mg, and was told to up it to 20mg if I didn&#039;t see improvement, but don&#039;t feel the need to. The only thing I hate is that I still have an extremely high sex drive, but am unable to achieve an orgasm. "
