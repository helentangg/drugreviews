"After going through a hurtful breakup and loosing my job I fell into darkness, life lost intrerest. I decided to try antidepressants. Doc prescribed Paxil. I read the reviews, most say it helps after taking it for awhile. Yesterday I took it at night. I couldn&#039;t sleep at all, after 3 hours I started to feel very weak, my head was heavy, I had an urge to stretch my whole body, lost appetite, but I did feel happier. Because it affects your serotonin, I started to think about my relationship more. All day I couldn&#039;t get out of bed, felt very weak, couldn&#039;t even walk, sleepy but can&#039;t sleep. Horrific feeling. Although I hear it helps eventually, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s worth the side effects. Bad experience."
