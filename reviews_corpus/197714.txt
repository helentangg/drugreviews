"I have been on Pristiq for about a week. It has been extremely stressful and found myself sick with stomach and abdominal pains.  After several specialists, biopsys and exploratory surgery it was concluded that stress has induced IBS as well as depression. I have noted that I am not hungry and I have not had an episode with pain so far.  As for side effects I have felt exhausted by late morning, however after a short nap feel fine.  I am a bit less anxious and my mood a bit better, however I have not yet experienced the energy to get going. But from the reviews I do look forward to that. I noted one person said they were told not to take with thyroid medication. I take synthroid and know my doctor would not prescribe this if it was a bad combination."
