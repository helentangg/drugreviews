"I was on it for almost a year it helped enough I thought I was fine and stopped taking it. Once I was off I hit a low and was put back on it on a higher dose. I&#039;ve been on it now for a year and all together nearly 2 and half. It does help but that doesn&#039;t mean there aren&#039;t still days that are bad and times I don&#039;t feel crappy. But it has made a big enough difference that I&#039;m not trying to hurt myself or kill myself which is good!"
