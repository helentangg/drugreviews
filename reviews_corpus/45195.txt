"Helped with my depression, ocd, anxiety disorder. I was pulled out of school for 4 months and couldn&#039;t leave my home due to my fear of my panic attacks. I was constantly light headed, dizzy, sweating in panic. It helped slowly but surely. I&#039;m upto 60mg, and there are still some random times of anxiety but it has helped tremendously. I can leave my house and go to concerts , and places with a lot of people"
