"I am a health professional who has suffered from anxiety since 11yrs old, I am now 32. I spent most of my life wandering what on earth was up with me as I worried about everything! I couldn&#039;t understand why I felt so low. This made me worry more! I could actually spend hrs and hrs explaining my symptoms/ stories etc. 

I knew that antidepressants could help my mood and anxiety but I was petrified of the side effects. 18mths ago I decided to try Citalopram as I was so ill. I swear this has saved my life! I never thought that I could feel normal again. It&#039;s a miracle! I now look back and cant believe how bad my anxiety really was, I must be strong to have put up with it for so long. Anxiety can really ruin your life, act now."
