"I&#039;m giving this a 5/10, because at 75 mg daily, it did relieve headaches that were at 7/10 on a 10/10 pain scale. However, I had to go off it, due to a rare side effect, that my neurologist hadn&#039;t even seen, called Serotonin syndrome. It&#039;s something to watch out for. I&#039;m on gabapentin now for neuralgia and neuropathic pain."
