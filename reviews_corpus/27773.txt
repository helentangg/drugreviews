"I started taking lexapro my first semester of sophomore year in college for depression and  anxiety and have been taking it for about six months now. My anxiety causes me to have extreme panic attacks where I break out in rashes and get frequent bloody noses. Since being on lexapro, I have not had a single attack!
 I also haven&#039;t had any extreme side effects although I have had increased appetite and have gone from 95-100lbs to about 115lbs. 
However, the withdrawal symptoms are very serious, take it everyday and try not to skip any days. I got a nasty cold and stopped taking it for awhile and then spent a whole week thinking I had a horrible flu (nausea, vomiting, headaches) only to realize I was going through withdrawals."
