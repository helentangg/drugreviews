"I&#039;ve been taking 50 mg of Zoloft for OCD now for 9 days. I stayed off medicine and dealt with the OCD for a long time until I could not take it anymore. Since I have been on it I&#039;ve been improving everyday although I still do the same routines I seem to have let some go, and the constant worrying all day to the point where you are making yourself sick has improved so much. I&#039;m finally able to joke with my friends and not have worry about something so irrational. So far I&#039;m very happy I started taking the Zoloft, the side effects that I get are sometimes randomly during the day I can&#039;t stop yawning along with being very tired but I heard the sleepiness goes away after a few weeks. I&#039;ve had a few headaches, dry bloodshot eyes when I wake up."
