"I really love this one. Suuuper effective in so many ways.
In particular, helped me get my depression and anxiety under control.
It is included in my &ldquo;concoction&rdquo; of medicines, and just recently I tried cutting it out of the equation.

-Ever since stopping it, I am back to crying regularly. Very sensitive and unable to control my emotions. I had trouble DRIVING because I was so overwhelmed with anxiety and terrified of getting into a car accident. Irritable, angry, sleeping 12 hours again. 
Depression is a bitch. I highly recommend giving this one a shot.

*BEWARE* This drug makes you unable to sexually climax. (Which is why I&rsquo;m seeking an alternative)"
