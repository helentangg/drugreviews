"I started it to treat depression from life circumstances and anxiety, specifically health-related anxiety (&quot;hypochondria&quot;) and it&#039;s turned my life around. Yes there have been side effects, but ones I can live with for now. At first I felt tremendously tired, that lasted about a week. It happened again when I upped my dose due to being depressed over the winter months. Sexual side effects happened in the beginning but went away. The tiredness went away. I&#039;m so much more normal now. I went from being a total wreck and thinking I was dying every day/crying about everything to functioning normally again. The only side effect that still bothers me is a feeling of dizzyness or lightheaded and almost &quot;not being there&quot; sometimes, forgetfulness."
