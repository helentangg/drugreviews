"I took 40mg paxil one a day for over a year and Never felt right. At first is was bad. I was getting really bad vertigo and nausea. Every night I would have 1 of 3 reoccuring nightmares and night sweats. I just ran out and can&#039;t get more, so I&#039;m day 3 cold turkey and feel MISERABLE. Before you take this medicine YOU REALLY NEED TO SEE YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT OTHER OPIONS.
Ps. sorry for bad spelling"
