"I&#039;ve been on fluoxetine 5weeks@ 20mg &amp; additional 1week combo with apripazole 5mg. I&#039;ve been diagnosed with major depression and BPD.  I have flu like symptoms and restlessness. don&#039;t feel much improvement before or after combining apripazole except I am very chilled and calm sometimes too calm.  I no longer have insane panic attacks or think too much over everything. I hate the crazy dreams and insomnia but love getting out of bed feeling like I can run a marathon-due to fluoxetine.  The apripozole helps with appetite which is non existent and helps boost fluoxetine. 
How much longer need to wait for the side effects to diminish as the restlessness is getting v.distressing"
