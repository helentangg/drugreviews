"I was on Viibryd for 3 months. The first month it was like my miracle. I did absolutely wonder, better than I ever have! The second month I had a bad bout of depression but never linked it to the Viibryd so kept taking it. The third month I went into a depression that was so bad I was very suicidal. I was angry all the time, constantly crying and all I thought about was dying. It was probably the worst bout of depression I&#039;d ever had. It was a paramedic who actually linked my problems to the Viibryd. I immediately stopped taking it and in a few weeks I&#039;m back to myself."
