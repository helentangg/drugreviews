"My pyschiatrist put me on Duloxetine 30 mg. in the beginning of 2 weeks my appetite decreased and also I felt more worsening of depression. It took me 4 weeks to actually kick in this medication and I am improving day by day now. I am more social and enjoying my life. I want to say to all of u is that take this medication time. It takes time to actually kick in and also side effects will go away. Thank you Cymbalta"
