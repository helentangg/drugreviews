"I am feeling much better, been on this for about a month, I can feel my sexuality coming back and I am much more positive.  Everyone should be told that this medicine could cause severe nausea and vomiting.  I mean bad, but well worth it.  Nausea starts first at the lower doses and then EXPLOSIVE diarrhea sets in for at least a week.  I&#039;m continuing treatment, I feel much better and gastrointestinal side effects are going away slowly.  Feel great, but prepare for the diarrhea."
