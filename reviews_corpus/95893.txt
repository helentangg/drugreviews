"Zoloft has changed my life. I used to feel like I wanted to stop living. I had anxiety with racing thoughts, feeling short of breath, social anxiety, and obsessive bad thoughts. I no longer feel suicidal and my irritability has gotten 100% better. I still get short of breath sometimes and worry about things but overall just feel so much more even keeled. I waited a month before taking it after getting the prescription because I didn&#039;t want to take meds and felt like it was a cop out. I&#039;m so happy I decided to give it a try. I haven&#039;t gained weight and don&#039;t feel like my emotions are dulled. I feel happier and more hopeful. Strongly recommend."
