"I was going through very intense life issues that caused major anxiety and depression. I went on citalopram and it worked well for a while.  Eventually I was taking 40mg until that starting making me angry and manic. So I lowered to 20mg. Things have been going so well lately that I finally feel I am ready to get off ad. I cut my dose to 10mg and honestly felt amazing! So happy. So alive. So energetic. I stayed at 10mg for 2 weeks then cut it to 5 mgs. At first I was ok. But its been 11 days since I cut to 5mg and I honestly have been having a terrible time. Incredible amounts of anxiety, jittery, extremely agitated at the smallest things. I am trying to stay at 5mg and just push through it."
