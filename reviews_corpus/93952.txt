"This medication made my depression worse. I couldn&rsquo;t even get out of bed to take care of my little one and when I did get out of bed I would just lay on the couch like a zombie. I barely ate and gained 20 pounds. I&rsquo;ve been on this for 3 months now and my doctor won&rsquo;t take me off of it. It&rsquo;s ruining my life and my relationship with my family"
