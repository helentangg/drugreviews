"My experience on Cymbalta has been rather a positive one.  As mentioned by others, in the first 2 weeks it does have side effects, I felt tired and was a little nauseous.  I was put on Cymbalta as the entire country that I live in ran out of my previous medicine.  I have suffered from anxiety, OCD and depression on and off for a few years.  Since the Cymbalta has &#039;kicked in&#039;&#039;, I have hardly any anxiety and no depression.  I think clearly and rationally and not as emotionally as I always used to.  I still do not have an appetite and I have been on this for over a month now and when I sleep, I sleep soundly and am able to fall into a deep sleep as well.  I highly recommend Cymbalta and am very happy with the positive effects it has had on me."
