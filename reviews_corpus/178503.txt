"Have been on cymbalta for a little over 3 months. It has changed my life for the better. My anxiety had gotten to the point that I was hiding in the restroom at work during episodes almost everyday. I am able to communicate what I am thinking more clearly. I don&#039;t break out in a sweat if something isn&#039;t going the way I think it should. I feel like myself before the panic/anxiety attacks started several years ago. I was dieting when I started taking cymbalta and lost more weight than I had been averaging. Didn&#039;t have as much appetite as usual, which wasn&#039;t a bad thing. The irritability is gone and I am a lot more pleasant to be around. I am me again."
