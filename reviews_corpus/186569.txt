"I&#039;ve suffered severe depression for the last 20 years. I&#039;ve been on Zoloft, Paxil, Prozac, Wellbutrin, Effexor, Celexa, Cymbalta and Lexapro. My neurologist prescribed Pristiq 2 months ago. I recently told her at my follow-up visit, &quot;For the first time in 20 years, life doesn&#039;t suck.&quot; I wake up in the morning well-rested. My mind is clear. When I go to bed at night, I&#039;m actually tired (no more insomnia!) and I sleep really well. I used to be a stress eater; now I only eat when it&#039;s meal time and have less of an appetite. The only negative side effect for me has been constipation, but it&#039;s manageable. I had pretty much given up any kind of hope that feeling better was possible. I&#039;m glad I was wrong!"
