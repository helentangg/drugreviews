"I have suffered from depression for a long time, but never believed it. I always said &quot;It&#039;s a rough patch, I&#039;ll come out of it soon&quot; ..8 years on, I was down and out and suicidal. My Dr. recommended Zoloft. I was skeptical and afraid of playing with my emotions. I thought depressed was just &quot;Me&quot;. But I gave it a go, after 3.5 weeks, the most wonderful thing has happened. I feel NORMAL. I can cope with my day, I am hopeful about the future. There were side effects for the first week, I took my pill at night which helped and kept up the exercise, they passed. If I can give any advice it&#039;s don&#039;t be afraid to take control of your body and don&#039;t feel guilty if you decide to try medicines, listen to your Dr. You deserve to be happy."
