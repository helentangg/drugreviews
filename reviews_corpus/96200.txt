"I have been on and off Zoloft (Lustral) for about 8 years.  My usual dose is 200mg but every time I try to come off them depression comes back with a vengeance.  I have severe treatment resistant depression and have had over 60 ECT treatments. Zoloft has been the only antidepressant which has helped me in any way and believe me I have been on them all. But as everyone is different I can&#039;t say it will necessarily be the one for you but in my experience of all the tricyclic antidepressants, SSRIs and MAOI&#039;s, Zoloft has far outweighed the others.  As I&#039;m here just thought I&#039;d mention that I am also on a new antidepressant called Valdoxan which is very new and also very good. It is available in Europe but I&#039;m not sure if its available in the United States yet. Good luck. "
