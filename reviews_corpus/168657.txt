"This is an awful medication.  Horrible diarrhea.  Horrible crazy off the wall nightmares.  Can&#039;t  tell whats real and what isn&#039;t. I saw my mom and she&#039;s been gone for five years..  This pill makes me feel like I&#039;m on speed.  Crazy speed.  I&#039;ve  never in my life felt so bad,  and so scared. "
