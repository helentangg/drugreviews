"I didn&#039;t have problems falling asleep, I just woke up every hour throughout the night.  My Doctor noticed and recommended Amitriptyline.  What a great drug.  It doesn&#039;t make me sleepy, but it really helps me sleep through the night.  It&#039;s not perfect, but like many folks, the stress of the day, just wouldn&#039;t stop bugging me when I was trying to sleep.  I&#039;ve been taking it for about three years now.  I take two -10mg pills each night and really appreciate the better sleep I get.  Occasionally I forget, and find myself up at midnight, 1am, 2am 3am, 4am ... It&#039;s not a great way to sleep.  I haven&#039;t noticed any side effects.  It doesn&#039;t make me groggy in the morning, though my Doctor said it might.  It&#039;s also inexpensive and generic."
