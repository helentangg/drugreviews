"I&#039;ve been on Effexor XR for almost a decade.  The withdrawal symptoms have prevented me from stopping it.  Every attempt in the past to change/stop the medicine has landed me in the hospital.  I am now taking the generic due to the cost, I can&#039;t see any difference.  I consider it my happy pill and have to take it every day or I experience uncomfortable side effects."
