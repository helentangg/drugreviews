"I was given this medication as a test of some sort. I had been in a abusive relationship and I was having issues with it. My blood pressure was sky high. My doctor gave me the blood pressure medication and she gave me the Pristiq as a means of calming me down and seeing if it would help me to lower my blood pressure.  I can say that within the first week of taking this medicine I was a new person again. It helped me a lot and people even notice a new and happier me. I call it my &quot;Happy Pill&quot; and people really see that now I am Happy. My energy level is much better than it was before. Really good product. I just ran out of samples so now I am now asking my doctor to prescribe it to me permanently."
