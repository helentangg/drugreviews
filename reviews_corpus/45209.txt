"Given my experience on this medication, I should probably give it a &quot;1&quot;, but I&#039;m going to give it a 4 because of my initial response to it. I&#039;ve had depression for 20 years, and the symptoms have never remitted, which eventually lead to my choice to seek hospitalization last year. However, a week after I went on this medication, my symptoms were completely gone. All of the cognitive, impulse control and executive functioning deficits related to my partially remitted depression disappeared.  

HOWEVER....the medication made me manic in about a month. I started experiencing paranoid delusions and had to admit myself to the hospital again. I&#039;m heartbroken that it didn&#039;t work for me, but maybe it will work for others."
