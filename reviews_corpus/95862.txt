"I was diagnosed with anxiety many years ago, and started initially taking prozac, which did nothing for me. I switched about 6 months ago to sertraline, and started on a tiny dose of 25 mg which didn&#039;t help very much. I am currently on 50 mg and the difference has been wonderful. I stopped freaking out about everything, crying for no reason, shaking, feeling faint, or any of the other awful things that come with anxiety. This dose has worked well for the past 6 months, however I notice it is becoming slightly less effective, so I&#039;m going to bump it up to 75 mg. All in all, though, sertraline works very well for me personally."
