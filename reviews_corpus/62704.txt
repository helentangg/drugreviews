"I have used citalopram 20MG for about 3 years now for hormone imbalance issues.  It has been very effective for me and the only real side effect that I have noticed is dry mouth.  I have noticed many people complaining about decreased sexual desire or trouble having an orgasm, but I have not had those problems."
