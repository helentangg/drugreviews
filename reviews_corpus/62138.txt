"Did some yawning in the first week and then my libido started to diminish. After two weeks my yawning went away and was replaced with clarity and a clear mind. The unfortunate downside at 20 mg after two weeks was absolute zero libido, I couldn&#039;t have an erection. It&#039;s too bad because it&#039;s a very effective medicine otherwise. I&#039;ve switched to Wellbutrin, haven&#039;t started it, going through a one-week wash off Celexa."
