"Was on this for about 3 weeks.  Sleep was horrible or almost non existent.  Was very anxious all day.  Could barely leave the house and was shaky all the time.  Made me way too amped up.  I have treatment resistant depression.  Thought this might be worth a try after failing with many SSRIs  (Zoloft was only one that worked for the most part but didn&#039;t get me all the way there).  Can help some people with anxiety.  I was not one of them.  Wanted to give it 4 weeks but could barely make the 3 week mark before I cracked."
