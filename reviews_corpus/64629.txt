"I&#039;ve been prescribed 200 mg of zoloft daily and I think thats excessively too much - any opinions? I&#039;m also on 2mg xanax 4 times a daily for panic attacks which works well. I was on Ativan 2mg 3 of them for night terrors  which worked well but they took them off me and gave me 200 mg of  zoloft! I was always told 100 mg was a max on zoloft  but the nurse practitioner seems to know more than my doc cause he was out and she was filling in! So next month I&#039;m getting my ativan back and going back to 100 mg of zoloft."
