"Hello everyone,

I&#039;ve been on Celexa for almost 5 months now.  On my 5th month, my doc bumped me up to 60mg.   I initially started taking Celexa for depression.   At first it seemed like I had a ton of energy, and I felt better than ever.  After the first month, I was not feeling better anymore.  Although my dosage has increased, I still don&#039;t feel a sense of relief.  I do however have no anxiety.  I don&#039;t dwell on mistakes I make like I used to.  I actually feel very relaxed.  So relaxed to where, I&#039;m very lazy.  I think I&#039;ve gained at least 7 lbs on Celexa, probably mainly due to my sedentary lifestyle.   I really don&#039;t have much energy to do anything.   I can function and go to work and all, I just feel blah."
