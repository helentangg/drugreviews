"Hi, I&#039;ve been suffering with panic disorder for a year which has become progressively worse. My doctor put me on Sertraline and I tried the first one. Spent the day out with family, no big issues just some mild anxiety. Came home and felt my eye sight was a bit funny, distant and I couldn&#039;t focus. Feel asleep only to wake in a horrific panic attack. Arms and hands where numb and tingling and my brain was slow. More utterly terrifying was that I couldn&#039;t see. White and then flashes of vision broken. I had panic attack so like I&#039;ve never endured and genuinely believed I was going blind. My partner called the emergency doctor who after ruling out a stroke said I had rare side affects. Never touching them again"
