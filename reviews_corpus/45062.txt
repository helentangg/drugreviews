"Okay, so hear me out. I take a 10mg fluoxetine &quot;blue oval pill&quot; once in a while (once every 2-4 months) from my dad and it relaxes my entire body. I&#039;m a hockey goalie age 27 and just finished my last season of college hockey. ( I know I&#039;m old for college sports haha) anyways; I swear to got these fluoxetine 10s work better than any pain reliever I&#039;ve ever taken. I&#039;ve had multiplied concussions / been knocked out Cold playing hockey since age 18. Do you think that has anything to do with the effect I get ? Every site I&#039;ve seen says you need to take fluoxetine for weeks for any effect. I&#039;ll literally take 1 , 10mg pill and my body gets completely relaxed, my muscles / bones don&#039;t ache anymore and I sleep like a baby. And No this isn&#039;t placebo"
