"Paxil worked absolute wonders for me for six years until &#039;pooping out&#039; last year. After a disastrous few months on Zoloft I returned to paroxetine which again has made me &#039;return&#039; to my old self. My alcohol increase (due to work issues) was almost certainly the cause for the medicine becoming ineffective and my return to anxiety and depression.  Many reviews claim SSRI&#039;s don&#039;t work as well the 2nd time which is slightly true. I feel normal again without the &#039;serotonin high&#039; I had first time around. Paxil/paroxetine is a miracle for me and though it has killed my sex drive and gained my weight slightly I cannot imagine life without."
