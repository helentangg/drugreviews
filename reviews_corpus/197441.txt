"I have had anxiety all of my life. Didn&#039;t know until I finally took a serious look with my wife. Doctor prescribed 10 mg. Had muscle restlessness, chattering teeth and insomnia, which I already had and Paxil made it worse. I&#039;ve had sex for a while i=with no orgasm and no ejaculation. Additionally, Paxil makes me have the urge to drink alcohol were there was none before. Going to my doctor to get something else."
