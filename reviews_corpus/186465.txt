"I have posted here before after just starting Pristiq.  I&#039;ve now been on 50 MG of this drug for depression and anxiety disorder for 6 months and I honestly think this medicine saved my life.  I was stuck in such a deep dark depression with severe anxiety attacks.  I couldn&#039;t function like a normal person. Everything seemed so hard.  I couldn&#039;t sleep or eat.  I started Pristiq and it took about 2 months for me to fully feel the positive effects, however I did notice a big change just 2 weeks into taking it.  The only side effect I had early on was insomina and night sweats, but those are no longer an issue.  I do notice though that if I miss a pill for more than one day, I start to feel depressed again. Overall, the best medicine I&#039;ve taken."
