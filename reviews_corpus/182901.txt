"I was experiencing awful panic attacks and anxiety that wouldn&#039;t let up, I tried so many medications but Cymbalta was the one that worked best for me.  Started at 30 mg for a week then went up to 60, then up to 90 mg where Im at now.  Only down side was it seemed like it took a long time to get here almost back to normal after almost 2 months but I&#039;m glad I&#039;m here, have not had a panic attack in weeks, anxiety is down and I&#039;m off all benzos.  Stick with this medication it did wonders for me and I&#039;m very sensitive to medications."
