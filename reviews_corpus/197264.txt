"Been taking 20 mg of paroxetine for almost ten years.  It was my family that noticed that it was working first.  I was much calmer, didn&#039;t lose my temper as easy and was just happier! I had dry mouth for a few months when I first started taking it, but that&#039;s gone. I still have problems sweating and I still need extra caffeine in the morning to get going, but it&#039;s a small price to pay for having a happier, calmer life! I&#039;m so thankful that I found this medicine, and that for $20 I can get three months worth! Good luck to everyone dealing with depression don&#039;t give up, and don&#039;t be scared to talk to a doctor about your concerns."
