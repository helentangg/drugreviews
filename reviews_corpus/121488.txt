"I have used for over ten years. Works well for depression in higher doses, 150-200mg. The side effects of skipping a dose are terrible, brain zaps, dizziness. I have yet to be able to discontinue, but am on a smaller dose. I also take another med. for night time sleep as Effexor causes me insomnia."
