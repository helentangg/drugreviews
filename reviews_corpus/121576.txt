"I took this medicine for about 18 months.  After about a year I noticed I had really gained weight... 17 pounds during my time on effexor. So I decided to stop taking this and switch to something else.  After just four days,  I feel thinner,  my clothes fit better.  I think I was that rare 1% that gained weight on this med. It is otherwise wonderful.  Worked great on my anxiety with no other annoying side effects... But 17 pounds was annoying enough!"
