"I have cronic pain due to neck and head pain. I have been taking elavil for 5 years 75mg a night. It doesn&#039;t help with the pain but I am able to sleep past the pain. If you have issues sleeping for what ever reason give it a try. I can sleep most of the night and I do not have a hang over the next morning."
