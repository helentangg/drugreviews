"Effexor sustained release has helped me overcome most of my depression, however, it has not helped me overcome my social anxiety or general anxiety symptoms.  I am currently taking 112.5mg and have been for the past week, however, before that I was taking 75mg for 2 weeks.  I will talk to my doctor about increasing the dosage; maybe this will help with the anxiety part. 

Side effects for me have been dry mouth; not much to complain about.  That being said, it has helped me a lot more than Paxil ever did."
