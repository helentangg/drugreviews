"I&#039;ve been on this since last June, at 5 mg once daily. I had a rough time adjusting at first but I felt that it helped so much that I wanted to keep taking it. For me, I felt like the benefits outweighed the side effects. I tried to go off of it last month to see how I felt and that was when I realized how much it helps me! I went back on it in October and I am tolerating it much  better. I can&#039;t imagine my life without it now. It&#039;s a very sophisticated drug!"
