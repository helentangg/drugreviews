"I have tried many anti-depressents over the years and couldn&#039;t handle any of them as I would feel so drugged and sleepy on them I can&#039;t do anything but this time my doctor told me about Brintellix, and he gave me a lot of samples.    He said it&#039;s a new antidepressant that doesn&#039;t have side effects.  I was majorly depressed.  I was crying everyday and even left my 30 year marriage.  Well I was on 10mg and from the first week it was great.  I was calmer, stopped crying, and I felt really happy.  I love it!  Only thing is this stuff is so great, it is $400 &amp; with my insurance the co-pay was $70 &amp; I even had a coupon!  I can&#039;t afford that every month so I had to stop. Now I&#039;m getting very depressed again after 1 week without.  Can anyone help?"
