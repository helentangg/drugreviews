"I was diagnosed with GAD/Depression 2 and a half years ago.  I was having severe anxiety/panic attacks and I completely lost my appetite. I was given generic Lexapro (escitalopram 20mg).  I took it for a year and weaned off successfully.  After a year of being off of it, my anxiety returned.  I went back on the escitalopram 20mg 15 days ago. First week was tough.. insomnia, feeling wired, then extreme fatigue and headaches. Those have subsided except I&#039;m still a little fatigued. I don&#039;t think I will stop taking Lexpro ever again."
