"The worst thing anyone can do is read these damn reviews!  All they do is put ideas in a person that is already on edge.  Then when you read what people say you start to panic and imagine you have things that you would not ever have thought of in the first place but since you read what other people are saying its putting thoughts in your head.  Just take the meds and chill out.  Have your own experience not someone elses."
