"Started Lexapro 2 days ago. Haven&#039;t taken 3rd dose yet.  Been on buspirone (BUSPAR) which has helped.  Lately needed something more due to some travel.  Have severe headache.  Couldn&#039;t sleep last night. Very very dizzy.  Waiting to hear from the doctor. Tried Cymbalta with a very similar reaction.  Doesn&#039;t look like I&#039;m going to be able to tolerate it.  "
