"I resisted my doctors claim that I was depressed and suffering from anxiety due to chemical imbalance due to being premenopausal. I have always felt in control of my emotions, generally happy and optimistic but for the last year I lost the ability to stay calm and feel happy- my moods kept slipping away from me and I felt angry and sad at the same time. My doctor put my on Celexa. My very first dose I had the worst headache I have ever had- I do have periodic migraines BUT never a headache like this. I continued Celexa, reluctantly and made it through the first week. Two months later, with an occasional headache and frequent yawning I feel like a dark cloud has lifted. My emotional state is remarkably calm and even a bit upbeat. YEA Celexa!"
