"I&#039;ve been on Paxil for about 15 years. Dosage is 20mg per day. I felt relief from my depression symptoms almost immediately, contrary to most other folks. It&#039;s been a very good treatment for me. Recently had to up the dosage due to a closed head injury suffered at work. My depression came back hard and crushing. The higher dose (40mg/day) is working very well. I have noticed a lot of folks have reported needing more sleep when on the drug.......... I have had that problem for years. Might be the Paxil. It has not ever interfered with my work life, but boy, it has been hard to get out of bed for years and I never could put my finger on the reason. Good luck to everybody !"
