"Was diagnosed  with  panic attacks  after I lost my dad. After going to ER and spending Night  in hospial. Was given ativan until I could see my doctor who prescribed sertraline 50mg for 7 days then 100mg. Had every side affect. It felt like panic was worse at first. But after 4 wks on full dose. All was gone. I&#039;ve been at 100 MG for about 10 months. And I feel great. Even some fears I had before my attacks like highs are better. My advice stick with it it does work."
