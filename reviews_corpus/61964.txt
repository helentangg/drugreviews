"I&#039;ve been taking 10mg of citalopram everyday now for 7 days and then had to up it to 20mg after that. Have never felt so rough! Those first 7 days were hell for me, really bad headaches sickness and very bad depression that felt worse than what I had to begin with! I hadn&#039;t been able to eat anything either 4 or 5 days into it, but i tell you now the first day I took the 20mg start of week 2 absolute different story. I&#039;m like a different person. Please stick the first week out as that was the worst for me it does get better I promise. Stick it out I nearly didn&#039;t but so glad I did now! i feel brilliant now. These tablets do work but give your body time to accept them and you&#039;ll reap the benefits. Be strong and stick it out. Tomorrow is another day :)"
