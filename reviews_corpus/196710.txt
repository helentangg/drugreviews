"I started taking 20mg 6 weeks ago for depression and horrible anxiety. After 2 weeks I began to feel less anxious and less depressed. My Dr then added 20mg of Latuda . I continue to improve and after 6 weeks my anxiety is minimal and my depression has greatly decreased. This combo has been great. I do experience reduced sex drive though. I hope this dissipates in time. I take both in the evening and sleep great."
