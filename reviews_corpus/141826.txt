"Been on this for four weeks now and have seen definite improvement in lessening of anxiety and depression. Finding the exact dosage and best time to take it seems to be both a bit tricky and the key to success. Tried 10 mg in morning and was spaced out and headachy (but not anxious nor depressed) all day. Switched to 5 mg at night, but still too slowed down in the daytime. Finally hit on 2.5 mg (1/2 a 5 mg) before bed and this seems to be perfect for me. Not overly anxious anymore, but not groggy or fatigued either. So if you are just going on this, do yourself a favor and experiment with dosage/times before deciding its not right for you."
