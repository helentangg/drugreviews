"I have had anxiety/depression since giving birth to my son in 2001.  Panic attacks were really bad, I was put on Buspar, Xanax, Paxil.  They did not work for me.  Then I was put on Zoloft.   It worked for approximately 10 years.  Then it stopped.  The panic attacks came back and the depression was terrible.  I went to a therapist and a psychiatrist.  The psychiatrist took me off of Zoloft and put me on Prozac and Xanax. I would say that it took about 4-5 weeks for 20 mg of Prozac to kick in and help with the depression.  Then at week 9, the depression came back with more anxiety.  The psychiatrist upped my Prozac to 40 mg 1 X daily.  I feel that I am getting better.  The depression is lifting, although I still have panic attacks once in awhile."
