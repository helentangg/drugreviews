"I have been at 75 mg for 6-7 years now. Originally to treat depression but I was later diagnosed with OCD and now realize that the symptoms were the cause of the depression. This understanding helps as my coping mechanism. I have tried coming off Venlafaxine but had no success and eventually went back. The drug does help with the insane thoughts and images in my head but they are still present, just not as intense (unless I miss a dose). I will be attempting quitting again when I have time to commit to it. The last time I tried it ended with me rear ending another vehicle. Minor but unfortunate. I&#039;m hoping for something more holistic and will consult my Dr. before my next try."
