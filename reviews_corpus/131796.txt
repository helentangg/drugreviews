"After very unsuccessful attempts with Lexapro and Prozac, I started on Effexor XR 2 months ago. Really suffered a lot to have my system adapted to it in the first 5 days. After that I had 2 wonderful weeks.  It has helped me a lot with panic attacks I used to have (specially dizziness and balacing issues),  butI have started suffering with huge stomach pains. I thinks those are related to effexor."
