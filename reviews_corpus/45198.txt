"I&#039;ve been on Prozac for one month. I don&#039;t notice much other than vivid dreams and weight loss. I started out at 125 and now am 118 even though I still feel like I&#039;m eating normally. My dreams are very lucid and intense. Gonna give it more time to see if it helps with my depression but so far I don&#039;t notice it."
