"Initially on citalopram 20mg and felt horrible and more panicky so doctor moved me on to Sertraline 50mg and propranolol  to stop the fast heart rate. Eventually built upto 100mg but still didn&#039;t solve the anxiety and restlessness that I had. Now I&#039;m taking Amitryptyline 25mg twice a day and feel so much better. I don&#039;t feel as anxious during the day and at night when my anxiety gets worse, amitryptyline helps me get a good nights sleep. I&#039;ve noticed a big difference since being on amitryptyline and with less side effects that citalopram and sertraline."
