"After a year of stress and then going back into my addiction that had been dormant for 2 decades I tried 20mgs of Prozac. The first 3 weeks we&#039;re completely miserable. Anxiety, irrational thought, mood swings, constant bowel movements....but I was diter I rd to hang in there. Amazingly I started to feel better. After 6 weeks I was a different person. I feel completely normal now. 

My wife was diagnosed with cancer and things went really bad in my life before Prozac. I am now on a much better path. I take .5mgs of Xanax at bedtime and wake up feeling great. It is like a miracle of sorts. 

Mood side effects: a little bit of thinning hair, sex drive is down as I find it hard to climax and I&#039;m a little less empathetic."
