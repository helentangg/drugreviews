"I have been taking Sertraline for 3 months now for anxiety, I started with 50mg and have had very bad mood swings, aggression attacks and feeling of throwing up for roughly a week, however after that I started to feel much better until a month later, I was feeling just like before taking the medicine (anxious) . So the doctor increased my dosage to 100mg, and had even worst side effects, very severe mood swings, aggression attacks at anything, hungry all the time and fatigue, this has lasted for a month, however now, two months after increasing my dosage, I have been feeling much much better. Bottom line, I say give I time to work, about a month, and if you didn&#039;t feel better, then you should talk to your doctor, don&#039;t give up on it "
