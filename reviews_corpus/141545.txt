"About a 1 yr ago I had a very bad allergic reaction to shellfish were I thought I would die. I was with my husband &amp; my 5 yr old son in a restaurant when it happened. They rushed me to the hospital and later that day I went home just to come back 5 more times not knowing that they were panic attacks and a lot of anxiety. They gave me 1 mg of Ativan and I felt normal soon. I saw a Psychologist and a psychiatrist too and they told me I also suffer from phobia and its sad because I don&#039;t know what to do."
