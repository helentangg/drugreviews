"Celexa for me helped with stress and anxiety, but I had to stop taking it due to the bad side effects such as: insomnia in the early morning, feeling depressed, dry mouth, memory loss, vision issues, and loss of appetite. Zoloft was worse though. I am going to use natural supplements and not these strong anti-depressants."
