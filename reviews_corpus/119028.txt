"I&#039;ve been generally anxious most of my life but about two years ago I started getting probably 3 panic attacks a day, I couldn&#039;t fall asleep, and I felt nauseated from morning to night. I&#039;ve tried my fair share of drugs and Zoloft was the worst for me. My anxiety was gone but I felt like I was having pre-menstrual mood swings 24/7. Most of the time I felt angry at everyone and everything except at night when I was extremely needy and sad. Plus food was constantly on my mind. All I wanted to do was eat. And after I finished eating I would still be hungry. All that eating mixed with not wanting to get up and do anything caused me to gain weight.
For me, Celexa works a hell of a lot better."
