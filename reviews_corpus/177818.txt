"I have BiPolar Disorder 1. My biggest problem has always been crippling depression of the type that causes me to become non-functional. My manias have been bad but not as dramatic as some - mostly career self sabotage. But severe manias have been few and far between.
Here&#039;s the deal for me: Cymbalta works. It lifts the fog, lessens the awful physical pain, stops the anxiety, and keeps me from lying in bed too hopeless to even believe death would help.
At 60 mg., it gives me some mild mania - just enough to let me live my life- but not enough to make me wild.
It messes up sex some, but not near as much as Zoloft &amp; others. I take it with Wellbutrin 300 XL. Stopped it once because of dollars - but never again."
