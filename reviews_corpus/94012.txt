"Started on it about eight weeks ago with 10 MG.  I went in to a new psychiatrist complaining of anxiety issues related to a stressful job, etc.  

At the same time I was weaned off Prozac which I had taken for the last 15 years.

Terrible dizziness is now recurring on a daily basis to the point I cannot even safely drive.  A wave of light headedness overcame me while driving in heavy traffic on an urban interstate a couple of days ago.  Fortunately I was able to get off and go home on local roads with the windows down.

I thought it might have been the Allegra antihistamine which I have taken for a long time without feeling dizzy.  Stopped Allegra, continued with Trintellix, still dizzy symptoms."
