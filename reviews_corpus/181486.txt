"I have been taking Prozac for anorexia nervosa. I started ever since I was 11. It has helped me with gaining weight. It sucks though cause I was at a normal weight. I have noticed a slight change in my mood.I used to be constantly screaming at myself, telling myself I can&#039;t have the foods I want. That voice is kinda gone although it is startING to come back....I have done all I could so that&#039;s why my doctor put me on this med.....I am taking 10mg now...They might be upping my dose soon though."
