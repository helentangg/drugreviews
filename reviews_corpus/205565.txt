"Been taking 100mg for around 6 months now for Depression and Anxiety. I felt an almost immediate effect from Pristiq, did have trouble getting to sleep for the first 10 or so days and felt weird and spaced out a bit but nothing bad. I now feel great, I have a clear head and great concentration. I&#039;m a lot more social too. I&#039;m much more relaxed and look at life in a positive way. Stick with it, its the best medicine I have used by far."
