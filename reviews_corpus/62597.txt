"I have been taking Celexa for almost 3 years.  It helps generally with my mild depression.  I take 10mg and when I stop I feel low again and when I take more than 10mg I start to feel emotionally flat.  It does not have sexual side effects for me, when many other depression drugs do.  It helps a bit with obsessive thoughts and social anxiety.  Also I don&#039;t feel intellectually fuzzy with it like I have on other drugs.  I am looking for another antidepressant, however, because I don&#039;t feel very alive.  Also it upsets my stomach and depresses my appetite and I am already underweight.  Its been ok for me but not great.  Prozac was the best for my mood and obsessive thoughts, but I became anorgasmic which was so hard to deal with!"
