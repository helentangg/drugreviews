"I am an 18 year old female, 5&#039;4&quot;, 118 lbs, currently on 40 mg of Lexapro and 80 mg of Vyvanse for anxiety and other issues. Mild nausea for the first couple days of treatment, fine after that. No other notable effects until going from 30 to 40, now noticed a somewhat decreased sex drive and some difficulty orgasming. Still deciding whether that&#039;s worth it.

Otherwise, Lexapro is decent. No fabulous turnaround for me, but definitely helping me get on with life :-)"
