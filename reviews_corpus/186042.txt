"I was on Pristiq at 100 mg for several years;  I was happy and positive, free from anxiety and depression.  Earlier this year I made the mistake of tapering and discontinuing the med d/t feeling dependent and sexual side effects.  I ended up having difficulty w/ memory and would cry at everything.  I have tried to go back on and after 12 weeks I&#039;ve made improvements but no where near where I felt before...I function but I have difficulty sleeping, have crying spells, and feel terribly depressed especially in the am.   I&#039;m going to now try Lexapro since it worked for a close relative; hoping it helps me turn the corner.  If you&#039;re on Pristiq and it&#039;s working, don&#039;t stop!  Discontinuing this med was a big mistake for me."
