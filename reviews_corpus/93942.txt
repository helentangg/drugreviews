"Have been on anti-depressants for 20 years, trying more than I can remember. Was on Cymbalta for 8 years, but it quit working for me. Depression was my biggest problem when I was younger, but now anxiety seems to be the bigger problem. Been on Trintellix for 2 weeks now (first week 5mg; second week 10mg). The side effects I can handle are nausea and headaches. The ones I can&rsquo;t handle are feeling high as a kite everyday, brain on warp speed and can&rsquo;t focus or concentrate. The absolute worst side effects are high blood pressure and ITCHING!! I cannot stop itching! My skin is ripped apart all over my whole body, and my skin feels about 100 degrees constantly! The itching is driving my insane. Seeing psychiatrist next week. I need help w/this!"
