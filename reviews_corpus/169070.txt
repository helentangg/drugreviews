"I have been on Zoloft, Wellbutrin, and Celexa. Struggling with depression for years, but Viibryd really has been the &quot;panacea&quot;. It manages all of my symptoms and gives me energy like none of the other medications could. It&#039;s definitely different from other antidepressants and for some who experience some difficult startup syndrome, PLEASE stick with it for a few weeks. I&#039;ve heard of a lot of people who had a difficult startup with this medication and the switch was just flipped one day out of the blue. Viibryd really is an improvement from other antidepressants and I encourage all to give it a try."
