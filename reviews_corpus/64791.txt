"19 yr old male going on 20. Had been suffering from extreme anxiety, depression, paranoia, intrusive thoughts for the best part of a year. Day to day life was a living hell and I rapidly began to lose any motivation and hope I had left. Started on 50mg, probably made things worse for first 4 weeks, upped to 100mg, wouldn&#039;t class it as life changing, anxiety and thoughts are still there, but a lot less intense. Much chirpier and can finally engage in day to day life with a lot more ease and comfort without feeling completely messed up and hopeless. Would recommend, just hang on in there. Things do get better."
