"Took it for depression, anxiety and insomnia. It has taken just under 2 months at 75mg daily to kick in properly, but when it did, I found it to be a God send! I&#039;ve been taking it for 4 months now, and cannot remember last time I felt anxious, and my sleep is best its ever been.

Side effects are dissapearing slowly, and I feel very happy, and look forward to the future again. Highly recommend."
