"20mg/day of fluoxetine works wonders for my PMDD.  I found it to be so beneficial that I asked for a daily prescription, rather than 2 weeks per month.  Only drawback was inability to orgasm, which I felt was detrimental to my physical relationship with my husband.  I switched to Wellbutrin as a daily antidepressant. Found it to be very motivating and with no sexual side effects.  After 6 months on Wellbutrin, though, I started to notice that my PMDD was creeping back in, and I was more irritable/snappy than before on a daily basis.  Now I am experimenting with daily Wellbutrin plus 2 weeks per month of fluoxetine.  Last cycle went really well.  I think fluoxetine is a miracle mood stabilizer. If only it weren&#039;t for the sexual side effects!"
