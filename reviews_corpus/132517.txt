"My doc prescribed 40 mg at bedtime to shift my sleep cycle.  History of acute anxiety attacks w/ tachycardia, and essential tremor.  First dose I felt agitated, anxious, and my heart rate went up to 160.  It did not help me fall asleep any earlier, next day blurred vision and &#039;migraine aura&#039;.  Things went downhill from there.  My doctor said to continue it for at least 4 weeks and the side effects would go away.  They did not - things continued to worsen.  The tremor increased to where I could not use the computer, headaches got worse, anxiety increased, I became irritable and angry, and my blood sugar went through the roof.  After 5 weeks I threw it away - blood sugar still high and tremor still worse after quitting a month ago."
