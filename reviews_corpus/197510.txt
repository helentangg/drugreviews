"Every person&#039;s experience may be different. I took Paxil for 14 years. SIGNIFICANT weight gain (over 100 pounds, before I realized it was the medication). In some people it suppresses the brain&#039;s ability to tell when one is full, so one feels hungry all the time. Left me void of emotions of any kind, more like just feeling completely numb. Weaning myself off of Paxil was very difficult - flu-like symptoms, clouded thinking, blurred vision, among other things. It was the first antidepressant that I had ever taken, so I didn&#039;t know that I wasn&#039;t supposed to feel numb. I&#039;m sure it&#039;s a wonderful medicine for some people but it didn&#039;t work well for me."
