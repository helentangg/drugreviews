"Simply an evil drug! I&#039;ve been on pretty most of them over the years and this turned me near on psychotic making me do things completely out of character, taking me from manic delusions of grandeur, to the depths of hell itself. You name it,i suffered it! Only by the grace of God,did i not kill or injure myself seriously,or others while on it. Some may be ok on it, but i&#039;d say,don&#039;t chance it; Avoid it like the plague!"
