"I was prescribed this med last spring (over a year ago), I am professionally diagnosed with PTSD, OCD, depression, ovary issues and severe anxiety attacks.. these were diagnosed PRIOR to being on Zoloft. It helps me feel less in need of doing things NOW with my OCD &quot;rituals&quot;, my ovary issues are getting better, it does also help with social anxiety for me.
I&#039;d like to say and point out, I heard of a lawsuit going on with Pfizer on this med and I&#039;m very upset on that. First off, if your going to become pregnant, ANY doctor should tell you not to be on anything except for prenatal vitamins. It&#039;s the doctors getting the money for prescribing the meds, don&#039;t let that fool you. If you are nursing, pregnant or want to have a baby, do without!"
