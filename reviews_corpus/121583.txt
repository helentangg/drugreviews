"I&#039;ve never taken another medication for my depression (which usually manifests itself in anxiety) so I can only compare it to not being on medication. It has, overall, changed my life for the better. I suffered for over ten years before I finalIy sought help and I haven&#039;t had a panic attack since I began taking it. Also, I no longer feel sad for reasons I can&#039;t explain, and, in all other ways, am still myself. The only problem: a significantly lowered libido. It doesn&#039;t bother me that much, but it certainly bums my boyfriend out. However, I believe that my anxiety and depression were more detrimental to a healthy relationship than the lowered libido is."
