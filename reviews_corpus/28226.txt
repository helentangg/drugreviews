"I had been suffering with anxiety and panic attacks for nearly a year. I, like many others thought I had something physically wrong with me. Several trips to the ER led me to the diagnosis of anxiety disorder/panic attacks. I was prescribed Xanax which I took 3-4 times a day to try to control the anxiety. My anxiety ended up leading to depression. I started on Lexapro just over 3 weeks ago. I was initially afraid to take it but I didn&#039;t want to continue on the Xanax that often. The truth is Lexapro gave me my life back! If I would have known that it would helped me like this I could have not suffered for so long. I&#039;m so glad I decided to try it!"
