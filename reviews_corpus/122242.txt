"I went through a very bad depression state a few weeks ago. I went to the hospital and they put me on 75mg of Effexor-XR and increased it to 150mg after a week. I had severe bladder cramps and waterworks problems while on the higher strength. My doctor reduced the dosage to 37.5mg once every 2 days. I now feel fantastic. One of the main things I have noticed since taking this medication is this. For about 35 years I have suffered with extreme pain from T.M.J(an inner ear problem). Since I have been taking this medication the T.M.J. has gone and I can sleep 8 hours at night, the first time since I was a baby which is 53 years ago."
