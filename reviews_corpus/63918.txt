"I was born anxious and have been on various meds most of my life. After self-medicating myself through the 80s and 90s, with a multitude of illegal substances, I eventually hit an all-time low point and just had to stop.

Sertraline is the best prescription drug I have used,  compared to all the other options I have tried.

Having been on it for many years and using my experiences of other, more nefarious substances, I personally find that by stopping for a week or two, every two to three months not only increases the positive effects of the drug but also makes it easier coming of sertraline for longer periods, without suffering any severe withdrawal symptoms.

Just my experience, I am NOT a doctor, ALWAYS consult a professional."
