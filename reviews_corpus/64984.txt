"Zoloft has given me my life back. I had anxiety during my pregnancy that turned into OCD when I was 3 months postpartum. I was a mess, but I kept telling myself that as long as I was still functioning I didn&#039;t need medication. There was an adjustment period where we figured out my ideal dose (100 mg) and I had to get through a sharp increase in anxiety while my brain adjusted, but little by little, I started to notice changes in my thought patterns. It doesn&#039;t happen suddenly, you may not notice how much better you&#039;re doing until you stop and look back on situations that used to give you terrible anxiety and realize that you weren&#039;t nervous much at all. I continue to notice improvements after almost 4 months on my ideal dose (100 mg)."
