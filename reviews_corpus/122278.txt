"This drug has been a miracle for me.  I&#039;ve never been a nervous or a high strung kind of person until the last year.  I thought I was going crazy and was afraid to tell anyone.  I talked to my doctor, and he prescribed the Effexor XR.  Started at 75 mg, and then went to to 150 mg.  I feel normal again now."
