"Took 10mg samples in the AM, nausea and dizziness big problem 3rd and 4th day. Stopped for 2 days. Then took 1/2 pill in the evening around 8PM. A little nausea, sleep was affected but adjusting. But I believe it is what I need. I left the house 3 times on the weekend, answered my phone, went into 6 stores and most important, while home didn&#039;t lay in bed."
