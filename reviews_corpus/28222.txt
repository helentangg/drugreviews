"Before Lexapro I couldn&#039;t get out of bed. I was stuck in my room for 6 months straight. I didnt go anywhere. I had social anxiety. I never went to school. I cried all the time. Had anxiety with breathing problems. I was suicidal daily. NOW I&#039;m a totally different person! I&#039;m so happy. I never have a terrible day. Got a job, have friends, and thinking positive about my future. I now love myself. I don&#039;t obsess over pointless things now. I&#039;m more awake and have energy. No more depression or anxiety.  20 mg right away, I love it. Its never disappointed me."
