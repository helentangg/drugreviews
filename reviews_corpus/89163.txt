"Got this as a prescription from my doctor, after spending endless hour doing research on this medication I decided to give it a try. I was on celexa for almost 5 months. During this time I felt like a cloud has over my head the whole time, my brain did not function and I felt like life was absolutely unbearable. Might work for some people but It did more harm than good while I was on it. Had to stop.  I&#039;ve found that what got me my life back was an alternate method that came as a lifesaver for me that didn&#039;t involve medication. It involves steps to being more motivated and accomplishing things daily.
