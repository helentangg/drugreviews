"Went from 90mg of cymbalta abruptly to 40mg viibryd. Went into cote bipolar.manic episode. So far this medication isn&#039;t feelING like it&#039;s doing anything for my but giving my diarrhea and making me starve and stuff my face with everything. Im already fat  so this isn&#039;t good. I have brain fog, depression and anger. I&#039;d say it&#039;s not working"
