"I have been experiencing severe migraines 2 times per month over last 3-4 years, that include terrible vertigo and would last about a week.  The vertigo was more debilitating than the migraine.  Couldn&#039;t work or drive. In between migraines I experienced regular daily headaches.  Started seeing a neurologist who initially prescribed beta blockers (propranolol) with little result.  Then changed tact to Amitriptyline which I am on 10mg per day taken at night.  Started about a month ago and am yet to have a migraine and headaches have also significantly improved to maybe 2 light headaches (more tension headaches really) per week. I am more than satisfied with the result and couldn&#039;t believe how quickly it had an impact. Early days yet though."
