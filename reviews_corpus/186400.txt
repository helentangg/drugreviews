"I have been on Pristiq for 11 days after switching from Paxil 12.5 CR.  I feel like I&#039;ve been on a roller coaster ride.  Agitation, shaky, anxiety and emotional. The nausea and headaches are gone now but I&#039;m thinking this is not the right medicine for me.  I will give it 14 days and if there is no improvement I will get off them. Not sure what I&#039;ll try next. The doctor thinks Wellbutrin. "
