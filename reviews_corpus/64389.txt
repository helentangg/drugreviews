"I&#039;ve been on sertraline for two weeks now after being recently widowed, stressing about the loss,  stressing about money....i cared for my husband for 16yrs full time ss he couldn&#039;t move from neck down.  Probably should have sought help before as the stress is big time....anyway,  now he&#039;s died, its all come out and I&#039;m a jittery, jumpy emotional mess.  But I need to find work without breaking down at an interview.
Yes its helped, I&#039;m not jumpy now, I can keep my emotions for when I&#039;m alone and I&#039;m more in control. Only thing is , occasional horrific headaches?"
