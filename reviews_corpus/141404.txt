"If you want to be happy, this is your miracle magic pill. I was prescribed it for depression and generalized anxiety disorder along with an eating disorder. I would get so frustrated over everything, procrastinated, and had a lot of crying spills and nervous word vomit. While on Lexapro, I could handle the things that normally stressed me out in a great way. I was so happy! It was impossible for me to have negative thoughts. I forgot to refill my pills so I didn&#039;t take them for about a week. I became really frustrated and upset and just randomly decided I hated Lexapro and being happy. It decreased my sex drive majorly. I couldn&#039;t get off at all. 
It&#039;s been two years and I&#039;m going to start taking it again. 
Lexapro is a miracle."
