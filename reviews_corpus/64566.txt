"I can say this medication works... I do not write reviews but I been that person on the net looking for answers for PMDD. I had all the signs of PMDD but most Doctors don&#039;t address mental issues during your well woman exam. I spoke with a NP one day and she listen. Zoloft work instantly... I feel normal for once in 9 years. I feel level headed. I hated the person I was.. I was mean and unapologetic. I was emotional wreck. I could cry at a drop of a hat.  Zoloft takes that agitation and highs/lows away. If your pms is extreme get help, it&#039;s pmdd don&#039;t stop until you find a doctor that will listen. Zoloft might not be part of your success story but don&#039;t stop until you get your happy ending."
