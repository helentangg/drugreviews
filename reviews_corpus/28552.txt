"I quit my job teaching due to anxiety and panic attacks. After being off work for two years I thought the stress of not teaching would help with my anxiety and panic attacks. I was just a bit better. I thought that eliminating the stress from teaching would make a huge difference in the way I felt. My anxiety and panic attacks continued even when I did not work. I realized I needed medication because I continued to have heart palpitations, shortness of breath, shaking, feeling of being smothered, etc. I have been on Lexapro for four weeks. WHAT A POSITVE DIFFERENCE! It feels so good to feel good! Side effects went away. Other medications I tried caused constipation. Have hope that you will find something that works for you!"
