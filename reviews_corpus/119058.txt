"I&#039;ve been on Zoloft (generic) for about three months.  I noticed an immediate difference in the way I felt. I began taking it for mild anxiety/depression.  I am now starting to feel more depressed and empty again, like my body is becoming immune to it.  I don&#039;t want to switch because I don&#039;t want to go through another medication.  Zoloft though in general has helped incredibly within the last three months -- my boyfriend and I don&#039;t fight, I don&#039;t get snappy on people, and I feel so much better about going out and doing things. I am more productive now than I ever was. I just don&#039;t want my body to become used to it because I love the way it felt to feel okay."
