"Hello I&#039;m 27 year old female. I was diagnosed with panic disorder and GAD  when I first started college.   The walls would close in and I felt like I wasn&#039;t working and then was put on 20 mg of the generic lexapro. Let me tell you. The side effects for the first 3 weeks were horrible I would sweat and be anxious all the time.  I started taken 20 mg at night than after a week switched it to the morning . My doctor told me of the possible weight gain but I took the chance I did gain about 20 pounds  but the anxiety definately decreased after the first month.  Give this drug a try if your panic attack r bad"
