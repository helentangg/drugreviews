"Have been on this many times in the past. Whenever I go back to it, it always works wonders. Each depression I have had is different - this time it has manifest itself with severe irritation, anger and uncontrollable worrying.  Been back on them for nearly one week and all I can say is I feel like a new woman. More energy, no irritation, no angry thoughts, hardly any worrying and appetite appropriate (was out of control before)."
