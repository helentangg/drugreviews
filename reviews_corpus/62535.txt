"I am a 29 year old female. I had been experiencing moderate anxiety/insomnia for 2 years. I felt that I was getting better, but then the anxiety increased again (getting married in July). I started feeling what I guess was severely depressed. I couldn&#039;t eat anything or concentrate on anything. It felt as though my brain was broken or stuck in a nightmare. My doctor prescribed 10 mg of Citalopram. The first week or 2 were hard with side effects (racing heart, feeling extremely dizzy/hungover in the morning), but then I started feeling human again. It&#039;s 2 months now and I feel awesome 90% of the time. If I upped to 15 or 20 mg it might be 100%, but I like being on a low dose. No more side effects if I take it same time each day. Life is really fun again."
