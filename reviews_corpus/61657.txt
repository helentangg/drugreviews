"I was on citalopram for nearly 3 years and I don&#039;t think it worked. The only positive thing I can say about it is that there weren&#039;t any side-effects. I&#039;m willing to believe that it helps people with mild depression, as a relative of mine with dysythmia swears by it, but it didn&#039;t do anything for me when my depression was severe."
