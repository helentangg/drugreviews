"UK person so NHS prescribed it for severe anxiety that was making me suicidal.  First 2 days I was off my head.  Very similar to esctasy. After 2 days felt more normal. After a week felt like me again. This medicine saved my life quite literally! Now I can function so well and am so much more productive. I do still get slightly anxious sometimes but that&#039;s normal. I have a very stressful job and I believe if I hadn&#039;t taken this medicine I would have had a breakdown.
My only problem before I took it was anxiety but it was BAD and I had suffered for nearly 4 years in silence. I have been on it for 6 months and don&#039;t care if I have to take it for the rest of my life.  It saved me and allowed me to be me again."
