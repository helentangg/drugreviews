"I have minor Generalized Anxiety Disorder. I stayed away from meds after of my experience with Paxil 10 years ago. After two years, I decided to just live with my GAD. Fast forward to my first baby, two new jobs and alopecia areata, I saw my doctor. He said take 5mg of escitalopram and to wait 3weeks before  taking 10mg. Weeks 1-2 were bouts of ups and downs. Weeks 3-5 were where I felt a gradual progression to &quot;normalcy&quot;. For me, 5 mg is good. side effects: weight loss due to not stress eating. I sleep great now, BUT I remember every dream and I dream almost every night now. "
