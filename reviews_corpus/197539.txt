"I am 41 years old and never took a drug in my life. I am a normal father of two teenagers with a very good job...basically what I thought was very normal life. I started getting what I now know are panic attacks on a more frequent basis. I had a serious issue one day driving over a bridge to the point where I couldn&#039;t drive over tall bridges...ridiculous right. Well I finally went to the doctor and have been taking Paxil for 1 year without any side effects. I have not had a panic attack since beginning on the medication and my moods are much more consistent. I still have a bit of fear with the bridges but rather than increase the dose I can deal with it. I would recommend this to anyone because I could not address this situation prior."
