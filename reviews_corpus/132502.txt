"at first my doc prescribed an amount which was too much (don&#039;t remember the dose) so he changed it to 10 mg.    worked at first.    i don&#039;t take it every night because i don&#039;t want to build a resistance.    tonight i took 6 (60 mgs).    that was 3 hours ago and i&#039;m still awake.    took xanax a little while ago.    benzos don&#039;t work for me.    took 30 mg of valium one night and was up at 2am cleaning cabinets.   even my pharmacist was shocked when i told him."
