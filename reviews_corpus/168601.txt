"This was the worse,  made the worse choice in trying this new pill,  in one month I did the change slowly,   I have bad headaches, I can&#039;t sleep, I have the worse taste in my mouth, ringing in my ears, very moody and crying all the time.  We don&#039;t smoke  and all I smell no matter where I go is old ashtrays.  Never again  so back on my lexapro.  Don&#039;t try this  its not worth it."
