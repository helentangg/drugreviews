"I had almost given up on life no matter how hard I tried to be grateful and see the good. My doc gave me brintellix after celexa quit working. At first I thought it didn&#039;t work. I had a bad head ache and felt confused. I felt hot at times. I felt like mosquitoes were biting me. These side effects have almost completely gone away and I am doing so much better now! I still get hot flashes sometimes but it is something I can put up with if I keep doing so good mood wise. It has been almost 4 weeks and I can work and concentrate for long periods of time. I don&#039;t eat as much. I feel sexy again! I think this is helping me a lot. I am doing all kinds of things I used to enjoy. I hope it keeps doing good for me and will help others too."
