"My boyfriend of a year started on Zoloft 5 months ago, after trying many antidepressants. He totally lost his sex drive, and it changed his personality completely. He was no longer romantically interested in me and left me after 4 months on Zoloft. We would only reconcile on days when he didn&#039;t take his medicines. He recently switched and I hope the new medicine is an improvement."
