"I have been on this medicine for several years.  I have anxiety and Lexapro works really good but don&#039;t miss a dose or try to wean yourself off.  It makes you dizzy and you get these Zaps; to my tongue and down my arm.  I am still not off it and went back to my normal dose.  Beware of weight gain, I eat very health and get pretty good physical activity and the weight just keeps creeping up.  Good luck!  "
