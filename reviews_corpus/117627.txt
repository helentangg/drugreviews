"I have had a headache upon waking every day for 40  years.  I always took Excedrin and when it was taken off the market my headaches became much more frequent and migraines were a weekly occurrence.  Nothing helped so my neurologist put me on Nortriptyline 10mg but I can take up to 3 if needed.  First time taking it I didn&#039;t have a headache in the morning.  It has been a Godsend.  My only side effects are that I oversleep.  I take it at bedtime, which is the morning since I work nights, but it made my mind &quot;wake up&quot; so I take my Lunesta with it.  I have to force myself to get up after 8 hours so that I don&#039;t sleep 10 hours or more which is easily done.  It&#039;s been 3 months with a rare minor headache that OTC aspirin takes care of."
