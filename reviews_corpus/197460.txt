"I&#039;ve had insomnia and anxiety problems since 2005. I was on Paxil for around two years because I had really bad muscle tension and excessive worry. I finally got to the point where I could not sleep two hours at night. I&#039;ve tried Effexor, temazepam, trazodone, Lunesta and Paxil is the only medication that calms me enough to go to sleep and stay asleep. I can easily get eight hours after being on Paxil for 4 days to a week. I tried to get off of Paxil once to see how I would do with no medication at all and after 9 months my insomnia came back again long term and lasted for over 3 weeks so I went back on Paxil again and I&#039;ve been getting quality sleep ever since. Paxil was a lifesaver for me."
