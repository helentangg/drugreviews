"I went to my doctor after suffering several years of depression. I was in my late twenties and had been feeling strong suicidal depression since my mid teens. I went to a doctor finally and after talking to me for about three minutes, he prescribed venlafaxine (Effexor brand) I started out at a low dose, and kept getting my dosage raised every time I went back to the same doctor. Each time my dosage was raised, I was feeling worse. The doctor just said it takes time to work. After almost a year of taking this junk, eventually at the highest dosage, I was self mutilating and always suicidal. Doctor was just looking for a kickback from the Pharmaceutical company I suspect. I quit it cold turkey and that was about the same as being on the drug"
