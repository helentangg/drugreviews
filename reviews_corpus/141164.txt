"I&#039;m 23 and I was starting to suffer from terrible insomnia due to anxiety. I was getting so stressed I couldn&#039;t sleep and it affected my job, relationship and my whole life. I was a nervous wreck I would start crying out of nowhere and couldn&#039;t stop, I would have panic attacks with my chest tightening and my legs going numb. My blood pressure was 150/100 and I&#039;m 23! I&#039;ve had a history with anxiety but was always able to manage it somewhat with a couple panic attacks here or there. Got put on 20 mg of lexapro and it has worked fantastically. I have my life back. I&#039;m not worrying about anything I use to and it has improved every aspect of my life. Give it a shot ignore the negative it took me 5 days to feel effects."
