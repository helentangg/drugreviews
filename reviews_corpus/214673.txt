"Been taking escitalopram every day for a little over a month now. I think it matters to mention I suffer from other diagnoses (OCD, anxiety, BPD, and another). My mood used to swing very violently between angry, energetic, and extremely depressed. Now, I don&#039;t shift from bored or underwhelmed (only every now and then - to very depressed). No matter how much I sleep I feel terribly tired. I&#039;m unable to draw, sculpt, or run as I did every day before being medicated. I feel very disconnected from my friends as well."
