"My doctor put me on Cymbalta for chronic pain with Fribro/Arthritis/Bursitis/Bulging discs. I have been taking it for a week now and cant seem to shake some of the side effects.  My pain is almost completely gone and I am so thankful for that. However, my eyes are so dilated all the time that everything is blurry and I practically live in a cave.  In the 6 days I have been taking it I have lost almost 10 lbs, I am not sleeping (though they say this will get better) and during the day I am having so tired it takes everything in me to stay awake at work. My reflexes are lacking as well: I am dropping things, losing my balance and my reaction time when driving is a little sketchy. But all that aside, my pain is gone :)"
