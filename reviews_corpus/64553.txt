"I&#039;ve been taking 50mg of this daily for 2 weeks and I&#039;m pleasantly surprised. I&#039;ve only ever taken one other medication for my depression before this so I wasn&#039;t sure what to expect. 

I feel &quot;normal&quot;. I don&#039;t know how else to explain it. I&#039;m not panicking over small things or dwelling on problems I can&#039;t fix as much. My depression and anxiety makes me kind of hot head and I snap at people out of the blue but this medication seems to be helping.

The only negative side effects I&#039;ve had so far are slight nausea and dry mouth. 

I&#039;m going to continue to take this and I recommend talking to your doctor to see if it could possibly work for you."
