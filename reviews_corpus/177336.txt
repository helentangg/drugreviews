"I only took this drug for 2 weeks before I could stand no more.
Insomnia was the worst of the side effects. I&#039;d fall asleep without too much trouble but 2 hours later I&#039;d be wide awake and unable to sleep as my mind would not calm itself no matter what I tried. I&#039;d be awake until morning then go to work and be mentally fatigued all day long. I also work on a rotating day/afternoon/night shift so it was playing havoc with my rest.
After the first week I was also unable to achieve ejaculation.
Other side effects were a recurring mild headaches, muscle twitches/spasms and nightmares.
It did start to lift my mood the second week but the fatigue was too much for me to continue."
