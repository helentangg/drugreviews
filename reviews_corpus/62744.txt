"I suffered my first panic attack in 1992.  I took imipramine for years which got rid of the attacks but gave some side effect and gained weight with Paxil. Doctors then put me on Celexa.  It has been wonderful.  The only way I can tell I&#039;m on the drug is the panic attacks disappeared. I would recommend it highly."
