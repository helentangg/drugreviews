"I took Pristiq for about 5 months, 50mg per day.  At first it was great.  All of a sudden I started getting really irritable after taking my does.  Super irritable.  I was in a foul mood and I would snap at people at work and at my girlfriend. I immediately quit cold turkey which I knew would be hard but I couldn&#039;t go another day being looped out.  Now it&#039;s been a month since I stopped taking it and I&#039;m feeling rather depressed, so I&#039;m thinking about trying something different.  What has helped my anxiety in the mean time is eating right and exercise."
