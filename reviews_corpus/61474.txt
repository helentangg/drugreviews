"This drug saved my life. I started having anxiety and depression about 4 years ago. They prescribed me benzos but it did not help. Then a psychiatrist prescribed me Citalopram and that&#039;s when things started getting better. I started taking 10mg a day with 1mg of lorazepam to mitigate the possible associated initial anxiety of this kind of drugs, I felt a weird headache (like being hungover) and a slight increase in anxiety for the first 4 or 5 days but after that no side effects.  Then I was told to  increase the dose to 20mg a day and after waiting patiently for 4 weeks, the real benefits of the drug kicked in. No anxiety, no depression. Just my normal life! My advice: give it some time, it takes weeks to work, but it really does!"
