"I was very hesitant about this medication working for me. For 5 wks i was taking 10mg faithfully, hoping for the slightest relief of my obsessive thinking, intrusive thoughts, and anxiety. After 5 wks of no relief, my dr upped my dose to 20mg. Now 7 wks later i am finally starting to notice that my crazy thoughts have subsided.I think a whole lot clearer also. I&#039;m no where near where I would like to be mentally but i can definitely notice the effectiveness. The side effects are pretty extreme but the way I see it is this - this disease is like a demon fighting to stick around in my head, and lexapro is like an exorcist fighting even harder to kick the demon out. But I can feel this demon losing the battle."
