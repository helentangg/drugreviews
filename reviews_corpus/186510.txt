"I am  on day 10 of Pristiq for severe anxiety from PTSD. I have been on Lexapro off and on for 10 years which works wonderful for anxiety but caused me to gain 30 pounds and made me feel so tired. After adding Wellbutrin to the Lexapro with no success we tried Effexor XR. It made my heart race.  After 3 days on Pristiq I felt wonderful but by day 9 was experiencing severe panic again which could be due to the switch from Lexapro to Pristiq without weaning off the Lexapro.  My doctor wants me to stick with it for a month so I&#039;m taking 1 mg of Klonipin 2x a day to try and keep from having panic.  My appetite has decreased but I love it.  Lexapro made me want to eat everything in sight. I just hope this works."
