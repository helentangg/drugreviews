"I have had mild social anxiety and depression throughout my entire adult life, but as I quit smoking a couple of years ago, both the anxiety and depression ramped up to the point that they were unbearable.  I was afraid to leave my house, afraid to  go out in public, afraid of was what to come next, as my condition was getting worse day by day.  My doctor saw right away that something was wrong and prescribed me Lexapro, 10mg a day.  Ive never been a fan of taking anti depressants or any pills for that matter, but felt like had no choice.  During the six months I took Lexapro my confidence skyrocketed, I learned to be at ease in any situation and felt great.  Stopped after 6 months, but the anxiety nor depression never returned.  love it"
