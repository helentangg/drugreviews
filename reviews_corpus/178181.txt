"My family KNOWS if I miss a dose.  If I&#039;m not around them during the day, then I know by mid afternoon if I&#039;ve missed it.  I feel unloved, depressed, yearning to just die.  But we try to keep the dose as low as possible that will still work for me.  When taken regularly, I&#039;m a &#039;normal&#039; person."
