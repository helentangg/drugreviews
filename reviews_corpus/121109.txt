"This should be BANNED! I hallucinated, had VERY vivid dreams/night terrors, night sweats/periodic bouts of sweating, seizures, heart palpitations, sleep walked, raised my blood pressure, anger issues, constipation, shakes/tremors, almost died on numerous occasions from dehydration, lack of nutrition and lack of care for myself. My doctor REFUSED to take me off so a few years later, I took myself off and changed physicians. I have NEVER had any of those symptoms listed above since. Do NOT TAKE THIS! IT IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS!!! Please withdrawal this medication from the market as soon as possible."
