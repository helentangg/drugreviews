"To start off let me tell you the first 4 weeks were HELL! The side effects were awfully.  The first 2 weeks being worst then the 3rd and 4th... I came very close to stopping the medication.  By the 5th week the side effects got less and less everyday and suddenly somewhere around the 6th week I woke up and felt like santa clause on steroids. My depression was 100% gone. I was my better self. I was even better before the depression hit years before. I have been on every antidepressant in the book and they all turned me in to a couch potatoe junkie. I had no motivation and no energy.  I almost lost my job.... then I went to the  doctor and he put me on prozac. It saved my life! !!"
