"I took 25mg of this drug for 20 years after being diagnosed with 7 different auto immune diseases including lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia. I went off it last May, due to increased irritability. My symptoms all returned from the diseases....burning feet and toes, pain in knees and hips and back and shoulders... so I started back on my 25mg.
The first night I slept through the whole night..first time in months. I&#039;m on day 5 and still have the hung over feeling 24/7, but nothing hurts. My whole body has a tingling sensation which is much more tolerable than pain.
However my appetite has doubled, which is a huge worry as weight gain equals more pain in the joints. But I&#039;ll take having to watch my food intake over pain anyday"
