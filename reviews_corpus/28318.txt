"Two weeks ago I began taking Lexapro and it is nothing short of a miracle. Although I was told it would take up to three weeks to work, I experienced relief almost immediately, within days. Prior to taking Lexapro, I was having suicidal thoughts nearly every day. My depression was so severe that it would wake me in the middle of the night, like a sharp pain or intense nausea. I would then lay awake. Since I started Lexapro, I haven&#039;t had any abnormal levels of anxiety or depression and I haven&#039;t had any suicidal thoughts. Side Effects: sleepy (take at night), mild nausea, extremely (almost too) mellow."
