"I&#039;m on week 2 of Celexa. Started at 2.5 mg for five days, then increased to 5 mg. So far, no terrible side effects. I do have dizziness/lightheadedness, but I had that before I started. Every now and then I get an intense feeling of anxiety pass through me, but it is short lived. Positives are that I feel like my head is clearer. Mostly more calm. I find myself laughing more. My motivation and tiredness are still a factor, but I am hopeful this medication will work."
