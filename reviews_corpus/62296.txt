"Thank goodness for this medication. I starting having anxiety and panic attacks. I did not want to take any medication but it got to the point where I had no choice. I was put on this medication and it did NOT start working for me until 5 weeks or so. Longest 5 weeks of my life. Headaches, anxiety worsened, nausea, I had horrible sweats in the middle of the night BUT I stuck with it like my doctor insisted! I&#039;m so thankful I did. It&#039;s been 4 months and I have my life back. Feels great. I still get mild headaches a bit too often but I&#039;ll take that over anxiety any day. If you are JUST starting out wait at least 5-8 weeks."
