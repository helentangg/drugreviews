"Having been diagnosed with Fibromyalgia &amp; night terrors a few years ago, I was taking the maximum amount of paracetamols &amp; Ibuprofen daily which were providing very little relief from the chronic pain. After being prescribed 20mg Amitriptyline to be taken nightly my sleep has been amazing and pain levels are almost nil! I feel I have my life back now, I was concerned that I may be a little drowsy in the mornings as I have to drive to work early but I felt fine and 100% &#039;with it&#039;. The most amazing feeling ever is one of not having to adjust everything I have to do daily to fit around the pain/muscle spasms etc...I also keep a &#039;pain level&#039; diary which is a real help on looking back."
