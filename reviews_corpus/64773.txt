"Istarted taking Sertraline 11 months ago due to anxiety caused through major life traumas and problems but work tipped me over the edge.  I felt like i was unable to smile fuction talk and walk some days horrible feeling so went to Doctors and started treament.  No side effects and after 2 weeks the black cloud lifted from my life!  I cant tell you how brilliant i feel im generaly happy calm and do not over react anymore.  I do not plan on coming off this medication at all... I am 52 years old."
