"When I started having Brintellix 10mg, nausea and itching nearly made me discontinue, but as my doc added Atarax 25mg (hydroxyzine) those nasty side effects disappeared completely. I think I am pretty satisfied with the drug, since I can tolerate it better than SSRI&#039;s or SNRI&#039;s, only minus is the higher cost compared to the older drugs."
