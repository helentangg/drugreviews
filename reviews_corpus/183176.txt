"Been on most antidepressants and ended up with mirtazapine, which although very good does make you really fat.  Cut dose right down but then the old feeling of depression, anxiety, suicidal feelings came back.  My psych doc. put me on Cymbalta (after a roundabout of others that I couldn&#039;t cope with) and Cymbalta works. 30mg is lovely but 60mg way to strong for me. Blurred vision, restlessness, anxiety, insomnia, etc., etc.  So went back to 30mg and now feel great, I do take half a mirtazapine at night to help me sleep and don&#039;t know if its the combination or just the Cymbalta (as half a mirtazapine is a very tiny dose) working.  It has taken about 3 months for it to fully kick in but now feel hopefully optimistic and more at ease about life."
