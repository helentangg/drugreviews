"I feel obligated to share my experience with Lexapro.  Before seeking psychiatric treatment, I&#039;d spend hours on this website (a well as others) reading reviews of Lexapro and similar SSRIs.  I suffer from GAD and Lexapro has helped tremendously.  The only downside was the side effects at first (unable to achieve orgasm, crazy dreams, extreme gas), but those have subsided.  My partner notices a complete turnaround in my stability.  I am very thankful for Lexapro.  I am so glad that I made it trough the first few weeks with the side effects.  This drug changed my life."
