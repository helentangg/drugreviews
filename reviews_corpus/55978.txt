"I was on Effexor XR for 8 years and I recently went off. I gave the drug 8 out of 10 because overall my anxiety and depression were greatly improved. I didn&#039;t have any sexual side effects and only felt dizzy when I did not take the medication at exactly the same time every night. I did lose a lot of my energy and was prescribed Wellbutrin to help out with that. However, the withdrawal, as others have mentioned, is terrible. My doctor prescribed a low dose of prozac (20mg) to ease the withdrawal and it really helped. If you are going off effexor, do it with prozac. I tried without it twice before and it was such a horrible experience that I went right back on."
