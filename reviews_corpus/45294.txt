"I was switched to this coming off of Lexapro, from which I was having severe withdrawal symptoms: dizziness, nausea, a poor time sleeping. I got switched to Prozac because I felt Lexapro wasn&#039;t covering all my anxiety enough, and so far the experience has been...eh. Like a lot of other reviews have said, you&#039;ll feel great for the first few days and then things&#039;ll probably go downhill. I often feel I&#039;m not in my own skin--empty. I have strange dreams. My self-motivation is poor, and I can&#039;t spend money without crunching numbers fifty times over. I can never seem to do things I enjoy without feeling guilt about something else. It saved my ass from the side-effects of Lexapro, but I&#039;m not sure if the 20mg dosage is going to be enough."
