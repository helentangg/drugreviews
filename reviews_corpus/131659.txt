"I&#039;ve been on Effexor xr for 2 weeks and it&#039;s great. I had been on Zoloft before and it pooped out on me so my doc switched me to Effexor xr and after 2 days I started feeling good again. I take 37.5 mg per day. I come back to write here because I wanna give back to this forum and give hope for anybody that suffer from this like me. keep to try the med that suit for you. best wish!"
