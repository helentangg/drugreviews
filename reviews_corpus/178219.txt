"I was off of the medication for exactly 2 1/2 days. I was a basket-case! Everything made me feel sad and overwhelmed. The withdrawal was bad! I was VERY dizzy, had fragmented thoughts, forgetfulness, etc. 

The biggest drawback of Cymbalta that I have experienced is the extreme difficulty reaching orgasm! My libido is just fine, as is everything else during sex....until the point when I should (and used to be able to) have orgasm. Very frustrating. Needless to say, if there was a drug that could help the depression as well as Cymbalta does, without the sexual side effects, I would take it!"
