"I was on 150mg at first as I was suffering from major depression and terrible anxiety. I was also seeing a councillor once a week. The 150mg didn&#039;t really help me but then the doctor increased it to 225mg and the improvement started quickly. A few months later the depression has gone and I rarely get any anxiety. This medicine has saved me. I was heading for a major breakdown and 
had constant suicidal thoughts. The only thing that kept me going was my young son as I knew I had to stay for him and would fight to the bitter end until I got well again. Now I&#039;m so much better. It&#039;s so strange when you look back on how ill you were only a short time ago and how quickly things can change and improve with this medicine and therapy."
