"Zoloft is wonderful, this antidepressant has made me feel so lucid for the past 9 months. It&#039;s helped me fight social anxiety, and anxious depressions after I had a neurotic breakdown, and had to be admitted to a hospital. This medicine has made things so clear for me, I absolutely love my life now! Recently I had not been taking it for about 6 days, DO NOT DO. It completely drained me.. but I continued taking it and the side affects dispersed completely after 3 days of taking 150 mg again. Zoloft has completely leveled out my S.a.d., g.a.d, and major depression. No, it did not work immediately, but it totally works in the long run and waiting for it to take affect. Zoloft you&#039;ve truly helped me become lucid in my consciousness :)."
