"Started taking &quot;Cymbalta&quot; (Duloxetine 60mg daily) just under one year ago. I was suffering from SEVERE and debilitating anxiety, everyday, all day for months. Prior to that I had been suffering with anxiety mildly for about 5 years, with the occasional anxiety attack every few months. It rapidly changed to a severe problem where I was battling anxiety attacks daily, even multiple a day. I was sure I could &quot;beat&quot; anxiety with exercise, therapy, better work/home life balance, and being an overall healthier version of myself. But I quickly learned that there was no &quot;beating&quot; anxiety. So instead, I reluctantly decided to treat it with medication. And it has SAVED my life. I actually have a life now."
