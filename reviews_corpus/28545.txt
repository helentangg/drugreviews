"I tried Lexapro because I was very high strung, was easily angered over the most minor incidents and was always worried about everything. Was hoping for any sign of relief. I didn&#039;t really notice any significant improvements in the first few weeks but I&#039;m on the fourth month of taking it now and what a difference. It&#039;s not like a light bulb went off and I completely changed. I still get angry and worry but it goes away easily. You just don&#039;t care as deeply as you used to. For me it&#039;s worth it. I wouldn&#039;t call it a miracle but it most definitely takes the edge off. I am thrilled with it."
