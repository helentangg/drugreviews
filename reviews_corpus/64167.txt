"I&#039;ve been on this for 10&#039;yrs now, obviously it works but at 100 mg dose, too much! I&#039;ve cut back to 50 mg and I&#039;m fine. On 100 mg I had a lot of weight gain, like 30 lbs. I&#039;ve lost a lot of weight now on 50 mg. I probably should go off of it but doc says if it works can stay on it. I worry no long term studies on this drug, but so far seems okay. My brother told me it can cause brain cells to die of w/long term use, he read it in L.E.F. magazine. Don&#039;t know if true, but helps my depression &amp; anxiety so much that its worth staying on. Be happy and healthy, find what works for you. Good luck! "
