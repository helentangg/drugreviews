"My 15 year old daughter was practically a recluse.  She is bipolar and taking seroquel, lamictal and intuniv but she was depressed and had such social anxiety that she couldn&#039;t even leave her room.  After 3 weeks she is the daughter I knew to be .  She still has issues but going outside of the house is not one of them.  I am so happy with this medication .  She started at 25 and is now at 50mg.  What a godsend ."
