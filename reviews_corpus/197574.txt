"I have been taking Paxil for about 6 months.  Before that I was taking Zoloft for depression.  While I was no longer depressed feeling on Zoloft, I realized that was getting stressed out about little things. I have always been &quot;high strung&quot; and full of energy.  Since starting Paxil I have calmed down and I am able to relax. I have just started taking Niravam for high stress moments. I have gained weight and I am also tired feeling, but the peace of mind is worth it"
