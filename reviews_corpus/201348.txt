"This medication worked great for the situational issue I had been in but the withdrawl side effects that you&#039;re not told about were not worth it. I tried tapering off of it very SLOWLY 5 or 6 times and failed every time because the withdraw side effects were that terrible. I eventually got off of 100mg and it took about 2-3 months. I used a nail file to taper my doses with an astronomically high amount of B12 and Omega fish oils. I recommend seeing an Iridologist before going to a doctor for meds."
