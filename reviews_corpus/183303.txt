"My hair started falling out so I discontinued taking the Cymbalta. I was losing a small handful of hair every day in the shower and it was continually getting to be more and more so no matter how much Cymbalta was helping me it was not worth losing my hair. It did help me feel better as far as depression and it helped me feel better as far as stiffness in my neck, shoulders and back; way more flexibility. Definitely not worth losing my hair though."
