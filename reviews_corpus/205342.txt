"No effects, no side effects, no nothing  Pristiq was touted as a powerful anti-depressant with an anti-anxiety drug built in. Besides clinical depression, I struggle with PTSD, agoraphobia, and anxiety disorders. All the years on Pristiq, my mood ranged from nervous to suicidal. I had several anxiety attacks, always in public places, and certainly was not capable of a normal life. About two weeks ago, I decided to stop my 150mg @ day dose. I experienced no withdrawls. My head was clear. I began to set &amp; meet small goals. I cry a lot, for example, over music. But it&#039;s good crying. My thoughts can sometimes be labeled &quot;irrational&quot;, e.g., I often believe my scripts are placebos. No more Pristiq."
