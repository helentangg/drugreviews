"I had severe anxiety and panic attacks daily for 20 years. It literally controlled my life and ruined my days for me. I tried paxil and zoloft and hated both and felt worse on zoloft than I did with out it. At 28 years old after struggling for so many years I finally decided to try something new and was prescribed Lexipro. It has changed my life. I feel like a normal person finally and can go out and do things on my own with out fear and anxiety attacks! I highly recommend this med."
