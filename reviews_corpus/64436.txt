"I started this only 25mg been on it 23 days and have had episodes of anxiety sitting at home some days. But my bp goes up when I have an attack. Anyone else have this happen and when I&#039;m relaxed my pulse rate is around 69-70 but when I&#039;m not its around 99-115. Dr wants me to stay on it this dose another 30 days as I&#039;m sensitive to meds I also take Valium for meiner&#039;s but it&#039;s never helped my anxiety."
