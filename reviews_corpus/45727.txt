"I&#039;m 16 and have been on Prozac for about 3 months and I must say that it&#039;s a great antidepressant. There are very few side effects for me including an upset stomach, feeling anxious, and few others which kept improving over time. This medicine really helped me to deal with my depression. Many symptoms like inability to maintain concentration, panic attack, losing control, brain fog, hopelessness, extreme negativism, fear of death improved within 2 weeks and kept improving onwards. I&#039;m still on it and I just love it and I think it can help anyone with depression. With the pace of time, Prozac really helped me stay positive about everything. Sometimes I feel like I have already overcome my depression. It&#039;s really helpful."
