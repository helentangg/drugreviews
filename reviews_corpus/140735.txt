"Well I went back on this as it was kind of OK when I had CFS a few years ago and somewhat improved my mood. After a few stressful incidents it became hard to manage my depression naturally so I took the quick fix route because I didn&#039;t have time to work out and eat right. 

Having achieved remission with diet/sleep/SamE/exercise I can assure you that the effects of Lexapro are wildly different than a careful self care routine. 

Day one I was so drugged, I felt high and was barely able to work let alone drive. Total lethargy, extreme anxiety and inability to stop smiling even though I was terrified on the inside. In short, similar to a bad overdose on MJ. 

Day two, same effect, I had to call out of work. Stopped the pills."
