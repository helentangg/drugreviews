"I had horrible insomnia for about a year and tried a number of pills, but none of them seemed to work. My doctor prescribed me 25 mg Amitryptyline, but it took about 3-4 weeks to actually kick in. I take it about an hour or two before bed, and it has helped me fall asleep and stay asleep. It&#039;s important to try and get 8 hours of sleep on it though, because it can make you feel groggy. I&#039;m glad that I have finally found a medicine that has regulated my sleep schedule."
