"After 7.5 years, this past Jan. I thought I would try viibryd. Went up on it, down on cymbalta. Had a moderate adjustment with ups and downs. It was not as effacacious so titrated down viibryd and up on cymbalta. Got deeply depressed in between and on one moderate day; tried wellbutrin. I  titrated slowly up and this was death warmed over! Titrated back from hell to 60 cymbalta. I am just back to normal. Long story short: if it&#039;s not broken don&#039;t fix it. Cymbalta still is the best. Some weight gain but some exercise can help it a bit.."
