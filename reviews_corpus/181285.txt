"I know this is a process, but it sucks.  I&#039;m now taking 40 mg of Prozac and it literally does nothing for me. I started with Zoloft, and at least that was an appetite suppressant  Both Zoloft and Prozac just make me tired, which is the opposite of what I&#039;m looking for.  My goal is to gain energy and be able to do...anything...other than sleep."
