"The only real way to see if medication works is to ask the people you live with. I&#039;ve been on Cymbalta for over a month and have had no side effects. My family can testify that I am a so much more calmer and less reactive. In fact my 18 year old daughter happened to be with me when I went to the doctor and he asked how I was going. My daughter replied for me and told him, &quot;I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s all in her head, but she is amazing now. She used to be so irritable and grumpy. Now she&#039;s really nice.&quot;  How&#039;s that for honesty? Like they say, &quot;Out of the mouth of babes!&quot; I really, really do feel happier and it&#039;s great knowing my family can see the difference. I remember saying to my doctor &quot;I&#039;m not coping&quot;, but I truly don&#039;t feel that way anymore."
