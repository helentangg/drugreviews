"Lexapro has changed my life significantly. I had GAD and my anxiety was absolutely awful, especially since I am in graduate school. I started on Lexapro and didn&#039;t start seeing the effects for about 6 months; but it was well worth the wait. I am the &quot;old me&quot; and couldn&#039;t be happier. My advice is to give it time- it really does take a while."
