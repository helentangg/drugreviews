"I&#039;m a 18 year old girl suffering from extreme panic attacks and anxiety. It had gotten to the point where I couldn&#039;t go through the day with out having a panic attack whilst screaming crying and pleading that I didn&#039;t want to live anymore, one night I woke up in pure panic and passed out with a BP of 79/60. I started taking Zoloft and it has completely changed my life and I believe it is saving me. I&#039;m so much better now, it&#039;s incredible. I tried 5 different medicines before this, and this is the only one that has shown any improvement."
