"29 year old healthy guy here. Taking Prozac 10MG and 0.50 Xanax Extended Release for the past 6 months. I&#039;m posting to support the people who feel they will never be free of panic/anxiety. I now feel 90% better! I was having mid the night panic attacks and weird/scary intrusive thoughts. I went to the psychiatrist that had the best Google reviews that took my insurance. Was diagnosed with Panic Disorder and mild OCD. Originally tried Prozac at a higher dose, but it made me sleepy and made me feel sweaty/hot often. Xanax XR was also added. It has worked very well in combo. I take both nightly at bed so I have a peaceful deep sleep. Prozac took about 2-3 months to really sink in to my system. You CAN feel better. Get a caring/good doctor!"
