"I took this a few years ago for anxiety, panic, OCD, and mild agoraphobia and claustrophobia. It helped tremendously. I don&#039;t recall any side effects besides hands being shaky and a little more forgetful. I had to stop when I was trying to become pregnant and I&#039;m not sure if it was the weaning off this or the switching to Zoloft but that process wasn&#039;t too fun. Not awful though. Still prefer over Zoloft!"
