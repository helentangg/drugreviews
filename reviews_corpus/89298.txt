"Initially, Celexa seemed to be a drug designed for me.  The abysmal lows and occasional glimpses of normality eventually gave way to an emotional state that was calm with no anxiety.  On the other hand, there were no highs just the flatline sense of calm. From the beginning un try il about the 2 year mark my serenity became so overwhelming  that paying bills, house cleaning, checking the oil, getting to work on time, making and going to doctor appointments and a dozen other aspects of daily life all became unimportant.  Nothing disturbed me, overdue notices, collection calls,  etc.  This went on for about two years until I reached the height of serenity and then began an ugly, violent, self-destructive and ultimately suicidal state of mind."
