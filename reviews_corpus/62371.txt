"I have been on this almost a month. It doesn&#039;t seem to work everyday. And the side effects are not so good either. I get headaches, yawning, can&#039;t sleep, and if I forget to take it that day my belly hurts really bad and I feel like throwing up. But I am giving it a little more time to get my body used to it. I hope I can find a better medicine or something."
