"I have been on Brintellix 10 mg and increased to 20 mg on 02/19/2014. I have experienced dry mouth, dizziness, forgetfulness, no desire to eat, weight loss of 11 lbs in 10 days, which is good considering I&#039;m overweight, this can&#039;t be a bad thing, and wake up often, however, I am in a happier mood and not so stressed out. I have been on Brintellix for a total of 11 days. Hope the yucky side effects go away soon. I have tried almost everything else and nothing has worked mood wise for me as good as this is."
