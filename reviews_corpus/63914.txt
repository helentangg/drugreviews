"I&#039;ve had the pleasure of being on sertraline 100mg for the last 8 years and I honestly believe I wouldn&#039;t be in this world if I wasn&#039;t. Every now and again I get tight jaw muscles or the odd day of nausea and every once in a  while, when I&#039;m feeling really sorry for myself, I can eek out a tear and have minor meltdown. But nothing like before. This drug has saved me."
