"Pros: Great at controlling depression, anxiety, and stress. Cons: Feel agitated, hyper, and impulsive on it; some daytime fatigue; longer to orgasm and decreased sex drive (sexual dysfunction makes me feel less attractive and confident around my man); vivid dreams at night; numbed emotions; must have patience when getting off to avoid withdrawal symptoms (my taper was two months long!). Note: I would rather have a lowered sex drive than anxiety, stress, or depression though. "
