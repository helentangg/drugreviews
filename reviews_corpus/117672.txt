"I had no problem with Nortriptyline.  I had to take it in conjunction with Lithium for depression.  My problem was when I QUIT taking it.  I&#039;m dizzy, sick to my stomach, I have ringing in my ears, I&#039;m irritated all the time and I can&#039;t sleep.  Just be prepared in case you stop taking it too."
