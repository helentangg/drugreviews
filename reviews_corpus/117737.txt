"This medication was a GOD send for my fibromyalgia. It works better than Savella, Lyrica, Effexor, or any of the other drugs I tried. I&#039;ve been on it over 10 years, but unfortunately about five years ago the side effects started to get a lot worse. Urinary retention is quite a plaque to have in your life. A year ago I also developed tinnitus. I have recently started weaning off and the tinnitus and retention is improving. If it wasn&#039;t for the side effects increasing, this would be a perfect drug. It fixed my insomonia and gave me 8 perfect hours of sleep for the past 12 years. It also helps a lot with my nerve pain. It&#039;s not a 100% but compared to other drugs its top of class for me. I&#039;m not giving Tradazone and Ativan a try."
