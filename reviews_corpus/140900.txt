"I took many SSRI medications in the past for anxiety/depression but was unable to handle all the negative side effects. I&#039;ve spent the last 3 years dealing with daily fatigue to the point of just feeling sick every day, so work and bed became my home. I couldn&#039;t find  the energy to go shop, visit my son, be with friends, attend church,  I just felt SICK .Daily crying spells every morning and an awful pain on the inside I can&#039;t describe.  I didn&#039;t know what was wrong with me but I knew it wasn&#039;t normal and was only getting worse.!!!! ....Dr gave me 10 mg. Of  LEXAPRO ..first pill very sick but have been on it 4 weeks now.  Thank goodness FOR THIS MEDICATION!!!!!  It took several weeks but as weeks go by I feel even better !!!! :))))"
