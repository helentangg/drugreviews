"I have been taking Cymbalta, 60mg, for approx. 2 years. I also take Amitriptiline (I don&#039;t know how to spell it!) as well.  My Fibromyalgia pain has lessened so much I sometimes think it is to good to be true!  My sister was diagnose with Polymyalgia Rheumatica at about the same time and was taking Predisone. She had no relief. I told her to have her primary doc to test the Fibro pressure points. Long story short, the doctor put her on Cymbalta and she felt relief within 1 week! Has finally been able to sleep better and lift her arms over her head. This medication has pretty much saved my life. I have been treated with bipolar disorder successively for many years, but noticed that since I have taken Cymbalta, my outlook on life has improved"
