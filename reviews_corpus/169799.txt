"I&#039;m a 16 year old girl. I have been on tons of medicines for migrane pevention and nothing seemed to help. One day ended up in the E.R. and missed much school. When I started on Elavil 10mg seemed to do not do much but when my dose was increased to 30 mg I tend to have less frequent (2-3) migranes a week. My migraines are less intense and I&#039;m able to do my studies. The dry mouth is much less when I chew gum but I tend to be tired all the time. This medication has worked the best for me, although not perfect."
