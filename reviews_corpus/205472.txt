"Started on Pristiq after my grandmother and father both died suddenly a few days apart.  Developed &quot;shingles&quot; --rash on my chin.   Doctor said it was from the stress and increased the Pristiq.  Got worse.  Doctor and my friends said it looked like a burn.  

Finally reading blogs like this I guessed the Pristiq was causing the rash and burn-like symptoms.  


Been off of Pristiq for 16 days and my skin is clear.  My head is better too although I can see the withdrawal will take many more weeks to subside."
