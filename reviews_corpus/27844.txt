"I&#039;ve been on lex for almost a month and so far my side effects have been minimal. The first week, although I didn&#039;t have anxiety problems, it seemed to spark a few anxiety episodes. Nothing major. I started with 10mg and today is my first day of 20mgs. I&#039;m a little worried about side effects. I&#039;m still having a problem wanting to get out of bed. I just feel like I have no energy to do anything and I hate this feeling hence the increase to 20mgs. I&#039;m going to stick with it because although I&#039;m still struggling with the lack of energy, is helped at least put a few smiles back on my face here and there. All I know is I want to get better, I have to get better! 
Good luck everyone I&#039;ll check back in 3 or 4 wks &amp; give a complete update."
