"I started taking this medication 9 months ago for depression and anxiety.  Before this I would cry for hours a day, couldn&#039;t focus to study or write papers (I am a senior nursing student), and was becoming suicidal.  
The first few weeks of the medication was terrible, because I was waiting for it to kick in and I had some side effects.  I felt nauseous and I couldn&#039;t stop moving.  I&#039;d shake my leg if I was sitting down and pace the hall for hours at night.  However, once I got past the first few weeks, things got much better.  I started noticing a change in my mood in about 6 weeks, which is a long time to wait, but it was worth it. I feel like myself again."
