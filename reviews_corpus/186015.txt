"I used Pristiq for 8 days but couldn&#039;t tolerate the side effects. I was warned by my psychiatrist that the side effects could take 2-3 weeks, however, I couldn&#039;t afford to wait much. The side effects include: feeling thirsty, having thoughts of going mad, fear, palpitations, heat (had to be in a cold room or otherwise I&#039;ll feel anxious), heightened anger, panic attacks.

The first few days of use were fine, but I had to discontinue because my work and social life suffered."
