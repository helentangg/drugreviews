"I was on Nardil for over 20yrs until I was unable to get them on prescription anymore. I was then put on other antidepressants but none worked as well. I can now get the tablets again and have been on them for just 11 days. I am finding the side effects (nausea, loss of appetite) hard to deal with but trying to persevere with them as I know they are amazing when into system, and before while I was on it I was able to lead an almost normal life."
