"Was put on this last year after a bad break up which caused my low level functioning depression to turn into a near breakdown. First couple of weeks were so rough, very anxious and weepy, agitated and impossible to relax. After that I can honestly say it resulted in the best year of my life. I was relaxed and happy, and realised I&#039;d been anxious for years which was probably causing the depression. I even went to a festival alone and had an amazing time, which would have been impossible before. I came travelling to australia in February and came off the meds without speaking to my doctor, because I thought I was &#039;better&#039;. I didn&#039;t realise how much they were doing for me, and in the last five months I have got worse. Started again today."
