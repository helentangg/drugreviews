"36. Depression on and off since 15yrs old. Tried diff Meds. On Welbutrin for 5 years and felt like it stopped working. About Aug 2015 I was crying constantly so switched to Prisitiq 50mg began Dec&#039;15 and crying stopped. But so did all of my other feelings. I Feel nothing.  Plus zero libido. zero. That is not good for a marriage. Thankfully hubby supportive.  Quit taking Dec 30 Dr warned me cold turkey would not good but trying. Feelings coming back but too bad just sadness right now.  Wish I never even tried this. Tears are better than no feelings."
