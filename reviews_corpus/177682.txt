"I don&#039;t usually comment on things like this but I felt I needed to. I&#039;ve been suffering from pain for as long as I can remember, along with chronic fatigue, stiffness, depression and a general loss of zest for life. I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia a few months ago and started this medication (30mg for a month then upped to 60mg). I have to say it&#039;s been a miracle! I knew I was in pain but I didn&#039;t realize how much of me was in constant pain until it was taken away. My fatigue levels have improved drastically - I still need to nap in the day but it&#039;s not the crippling fatigue I suffered with before. I&#039;m happy, mobile, pain free and full of energy thanks to this medication. I have also lost weight which is a great side effect!"
