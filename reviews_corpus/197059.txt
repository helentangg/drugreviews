"The cost of Brisdelle (Paroxetine) is high,but it is worth it. It took about 60 days, but I have 85% reduction of in symptoms in &quot;the sweats&quot; and irritability. This is a slow-release and small dosage of an antidepressant. Therefore, the anti-depression action should be very minimal. If a physician is prescribing Paroxetine at 10mg or greater and stating that it should help with menopausal symtoms, it is helping more with depression and anxiety.  Paroxetine CR 12.5mg or higher is also more for depression/anxiety. Just as antidepressants are used at sub-therapeutic dosages for pain relief, the difference is in the amount of the medication and also the time it takes to be absorbed in the body.  My advice is to talk to your prescriber carefully"
