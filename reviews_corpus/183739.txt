"Helped greatly with pain, confusion and saying words I was thinking. Went from about 4-5 hours of sleep a night to 12-14 hours solid sleep for first month. (It felt GREAT to sleep without waking from pain. First time in 8-9 years!) Now only have an occasional late night here and there and sleep as much or little as I want. I do have muscle tightness and  twitching when I lay down at night. Stretching and heated muscle rubs help. "
