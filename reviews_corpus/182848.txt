"By the third dose, I had experienced chest tightness, dry mouth, dilated pupils, dizziness and a loss of emotions. The most interference in my life was the dizziness. I did not want to drive the 25 miles to work and back due to feeling dizzy. The side effect that bothered me the most was the lack of feeling emotions. I felt very detached from any emotion and was unable to cry, laugh or feel love. I discontinued the drug after the third dose. This was not the way I wanted to feel while dealing with moderate anxiety. I&#039;ll look for herbal remedies and remain in therapist-guided talk therapy. I don&#039;t want to be a dizzy emotional zombie. I am also scared to death, from what I&#039;ve read, to discontinue this drug due to horrendous bad side effects."
