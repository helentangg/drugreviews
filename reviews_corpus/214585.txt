"So I have been taking Prozac for a long time but I was always taking naps and tired, I didn&rsquo;t want to do anything go anywhere. I decided to look into Lexapro reviews some of them really scared me. I thought why not give it a shot one of my cousins takes Lexapro. The doctor switched me from Prozac to Lexapro and I&rsquo;m going on three weeks I feel so much better I have more energy  I&rsquo;m not sleeping all the time. I&rsquo;m noticing more things that make me happy. I did have side effects in the beginning but they were very mild constipation dizziness tingly feelings but those are starting to go away. I&rsquo;m so glad I try this medication I hope it continues to work for me. The doctor started me on 5 mg and I&rsquo;m slowly working my way up to 10 mg. Write your reviews because people actually do read them."
