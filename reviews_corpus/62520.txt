"I have suffered with anxiety since my early 20&#039;s. I&#039;m now 27. After the loss of my father it threw me into a depression that I couldn&#039;t seem to get out of. I started Celexa 20 mg about 2 weeks ago, the first two days I could tell I was on medicine, I was a little slow, however the 3rd day I felt like a brand new person. I have no depression, anxiety, mood swings. I feel as if everything that I thought consumed my life was over. I had a new approach to dealing with everyday life. I think Celexa saved me. I did lose my appetite but I wanted to lose a few pounds anyways. So another good thing about it and I have occasional dry mouth HOWEVER I feel great. So I&#039;ll take it. I recommend this medicine to anyone."
