"I&#039;m a 63 yr old female, living alone. I&#039;ve been on generic Lexapro since March 2016, 10mg. My dr. prescribed this after I described my high level of stress and anxiety, which caused sleepless nights. My extreme stress has been related to dealing with my elderly mother, who has signs of senility , but insists on living alone. There are other issues involved, but the point is: I&#039;m 90% better. This medicine has &#039;fully kicked in&#039;, and I feel like a renewed person, with a greater quality of life. Sleeping through the night, and able to function &amp; feel normal again. No words to describe the positive changes. Grateful this medicine worked for me!"
