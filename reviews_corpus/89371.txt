"I&#039;ve had stints of anxiety and depression throughout my life. It got much worse when I got to college. It took me two years until my family and friends wanted me to seek help. My doctor put me on 10mg of Celexa a day and I felt it the first day! Felt so much better and more productive. I&#039;m back to my normal self and not scared/sad to experience the things I used to enjoy."
