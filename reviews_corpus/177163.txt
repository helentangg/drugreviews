"I tried cymbalta before and I gave up two times many side effects, but after trying all others medication like gabapentin, savella, lyrica, pain killers, I decide to give a last chance, and finally work, the first 3 weeks I have all kind of side effects but eventually pass, I started at lower dose of 20 mg once a day then after a month 40 mg a day for two weeks and now I am taking 60 mg once a day. I still experience some moods issues, but my pain went from 10 to 3 and so far I have been on 60 mg for a week, so I hope it keep helping me with the fibromyalgia and anxiety."
