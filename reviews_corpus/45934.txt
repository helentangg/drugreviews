"This is my second day on Prozac to treat my post traumatic stress disorder. I&#039;ve had a little trouble sleeping, some dry mouth, and a definite drop in libido. But you know what? I will take these any day over screaming at my family like a lunatic and feeling completely out of control. These 2 days have been uneventful in that regard and I give my thanks to Prozac."
