"Severe constipation, horrible horrible time it gave me,I don&#039;t care what anyone says,I was on it for 6 weeks and had to take laxatives every other night just to get relief before it finally hit me what was happening, I went off it right away, terrible drug,I&#039;d rather live with any kind of pain then to ever go through that again!!!!"
