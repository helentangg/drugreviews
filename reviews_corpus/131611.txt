"Effexor changed my life. I was suffering from bad depression for over two years due to something that happened in my life.  I couldn&#039;t get the thoughts out of my mind.  So daily, I would feel sad and depressed. I started with Wellbutrin,  which I liked for depression and energy, but it made my anxiety which I also have worse. Anyways back to Effexor. The first 2 weeks taking effexor were kinda horrible.  I felt weird, tired, and I was thinking of stopping this medication.  But I stuck with it. I have to say I feel normal again, and my depression is gone. Even if I think of my past, I don&#039;t get sad anymore.  So thank you Effexor"
