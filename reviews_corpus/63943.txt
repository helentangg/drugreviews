"After seeing the man who beat and raped me get off with a slap on the wrists I could hardly function. I lived in such a state of constant anxiety and distrust. I really didn&#039;t want to live anymore and the only thing that forced me to was my children. This drug was a last resort but it really has helped me manage again and restored some sense of calm. Before I didn&#039;t want to leave the house and now I can. I feel like I&#039;m becoming myself again. I&#039;m so glad I stuck with it. It saved my life."
