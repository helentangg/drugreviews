"I started taking Cipralex 3 weeks ago for depression, severe anxiety/social anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder-like behavior and an eating disorder.

I know it&#039;s only been 3 weeks but I cannot even BEGIN to describe how thankful I am that I finally got the help I needed. I feel FANTASTIC. The obsessive, anxious thoughts have gone away, and the giant hamster wheel spinning in my head at 1 million miles per hour has finally stopped. I can think, I can breathe, I can function.

Thank you Cipralex."
