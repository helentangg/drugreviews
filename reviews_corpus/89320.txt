"I have suffered from depression my entire life it seems like. I&#039;ve been on many, MANY anti-depressants. But this one works like a charm. The only bad thing about it is - if you go cold turkey for a few days because you run out, or forget to take it you can tell a definite difference. It makes you extremely sick. Never go cold turkey but I recommend this medication to any and everyone with depression who have tried many medications."
