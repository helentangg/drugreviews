"After an escalating two year psychotic depression I finally sought help- I was suicidal and believed I was beyond help. Olanzapine eased the psychosis but the deep dark depression I was in was relentless. It took a year of finding the right fit, prozac and citalopram didn&#039;t help me at all. Finally I was put on Effexor at 225mg and have been on it for 3 months. It has made a massive difference in a short amount of time. Don&#039;t take as long as I did to find the right combo, I assumed these drugs were more or less the same so thought they just couldn&#039;t help me. Effexor saved the day, and with olanzapine, my life!"
