"Cymbalta has been a heaven sent. I have severe osteoarthritis in both knees and I&#039;m 35. I stayed in chronic pain. On a 1-10 scale I was 76. This medication took my pain level to a 2. I couldn&#039;t believe how effective it was after 1 dose. I do suffer side effects such as nausea and diarrhea but I&#039;m praying it passes. I&#039;ve only been on the meds 3 days. I don&#039;t feel sidelined in life anymore. I can participate nearly pain free."
