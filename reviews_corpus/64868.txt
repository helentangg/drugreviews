"Makes you feel worse for the first few days but the side affects start to wear off. On my 4 th day still got a little light head and a bit anxious but I feel so much better than what I did 4 days ago! Can get up and get dressed and do what I need to do. Taking your mind off it will make you feel better, constantly thinking about it will make you more anxious. Think positive:) overall I feel better than I did before, can&#039;t wait until it takes the full effect."
