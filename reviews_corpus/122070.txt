"I&#039;ve used tricyclics and SSRIs before.  Both caused huge weight gain, and were only moderately effective.  Effexor XR worked very well for me at 150mg for several years.  I was able to lose a small amount of weight, and stopped having late night craving for sugary stuff, and it was very effective in combating the depression symptoms. I slept well but was not lethargic during the day; I took it at night.  Later on I needed to increase my dose. I am now on 300mg, and started losing weight again (a good thing in my case) and have more energy.  It takes longer to have an orgasm but other than that, I&#039;ve been very lucky in having few to no side effects. The one thing I hate is that if I miss a dose, side effects are AWFUL!"
