"This drug is a life saver for me.  I&#039;ve been on Effexor XR 150mg daily for about 4 1/2 years.  There were some minor side effects at the beginning, such as wakefuleness at night; my doctor suggested I dose in the morning.  I sleep fine every night now.  Caution - once I ran out of medication and thought since I felt better, that I&#039;d be fine.  Within 30 hours I was in a painful, suicidal state of withdrawal.  I later learned that abruptly stopping this medicine results in a nose dive in your system."
