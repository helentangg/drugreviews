"Lexapro is great. I started when my panic attacks and depression made me unable to function at all and I was too afraid to leave my house. My thoughts would race and I was just a mess. I started on 5mg for a week which was like nothing but then upped to 10mg and after 3 weeks I was beginning to feel less anxious and more stable. After 6 weeks I&#039;d say I felt normal. I&#039;m going to try come off them after being on them for a year and a half. I haven&#039;t had a panic attack in over a year so for panic disorder they work fantastically well. I&#039;ve experienced no side effects with this drug."
