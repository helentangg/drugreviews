"This pill has changed my life. I remember having anxiety and panic attacks in elementary school. My parents never felt that it was necessary to take me to the doctor but in college I started having bad panic attacks before and during exams. My anxiety really started affecting my life. I went to counseling and a stress therapist but Zoloft is really what has helped the most. I have noticed that it makes me sleepy during the day, even though I do take it at night. And I&#039;m not completely certain but I think that it has caused a little weight loss since I have taken it for the last two months. Overall I would say that this medicine has more benefits than negative side effects. Thank you."
