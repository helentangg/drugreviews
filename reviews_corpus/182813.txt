"I took cymbalta for depression, anxiety, and for severe fibromyalgia symtoms.

The extreme mood swings, depression, constant thoughts of suicide, symtoms that mimicked my already existing fibromyalgia symptoms and unfortunately made them worse.

Sleepless nights-even days at a time, drowsiness, complete change in my personality.

When I started a physician observed decrease with intention to quit cymbalta altogether, I tried killing myself multiple time, shakes, tremors, skin crawling, brain and body &quot;zaps&quot;, nausea vomiting diarrhea mood swings hospitalization.

Don&#039;t, just don&#039;t take it. There are other drugs and cbt therapies that are tried and true. Whose long term side effects are well understood and documented. Almost ruined me."
