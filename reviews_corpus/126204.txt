"When I first started taking this I was hoping this would work good for me as I&#039;ve read a lot of reviews and heard mostly good things. The 1st 3 wks were good. I was starting too feel that it was starting too work but after that..things get horrible. I had anxiety and panic attacks all day. So bad that I wouldn&#039;t leave my house. It took me a few days to realize that it was Viibryd. These panic attacks were bad. Woke up with them, went to bed having them. I didn&#039;t want to stop taking so next day took half..20mg..and they stopped. My Doctor wants me to just stay on the 20mg but I didn&#039;t think its doing anything. I&#039;m on my 4th to 5th week. Things almost seem to go back to when I started."
