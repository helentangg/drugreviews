"I started this medication for hemiplegic migraines, I was also experiencing bad anxiety and dizziness. I started at 25 mg and I saw an immediate decrease in my anxiety and dizziness, I did suffer a bad migraine and my doctor increased my dose to 50 mg at bedtime, it has worked wonderfully with the added bonus of getting a great nights sleep
