"Had been in a great deal of pain for over 3 years was diagnosed with fibromyalgia 2 months ago. 
My Doctor put me on Cymbalta 30mg once a day 2 weeks ago it took 5 days to kick in wow I am very pleased, I feel 90% pain free.
I feel tired but I would rather be tired then in pain. It&#039;s nice to sleep pain free."
