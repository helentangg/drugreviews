"Lexapro has given me my life back. Now I&#039;m back to work, back at the gym, socializing, running errands - all things that for the past year I could not do. I feel more at ease with life in general and my depression has also lifted. My husband has noted that I&#039;m much easier to get along with and in turn he is happier. I&#039;ve tried other meds in the past but this has worked wonders for me. I started on 5mg then after 2 months I went to 10mg. No weight gain at all, sleeping better and smiling more."
