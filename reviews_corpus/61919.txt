"I have been taking this for about 3-4 years and what a difference it has made in my life. I started out at 20mg and because of my size 250 the Doc went to 30 mg and bingo what a relief. Hang in there and give it a chance to work and you will get there. It doesn&#039;t happen over night. everyone&#039;s metabolism is different."
