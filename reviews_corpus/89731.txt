"I switched to Celexa from Paxil (which I had been on for 7 years for anxiety). It&#039;s been 6 weeks and although the transition was smooth to 10 mg of Celexa, there&#039;s just one major problem for me..no sex drive. I&#039;m a 25 year old female and also am on birth control (have been for 6 years) maybe its the combination of both the Celexa and birth control! I&#039;m hoping this one side effect will go away because otherwise its a good drug."
