"Gained 30 pounds while on prednisone.  It was my 5th medicine to try. I was skeptical but it actually worked. Pristiq made me so sleepy and in a constant state of lala land. Gained 30 pounds while on prednisone and Started pristiq at the same time. I have gone a year and a half and still haven&#039;t lost the weight. It&#039;s different for everyone, and weight gain isn&#039;t normal, apparently. I tapered off the 100mg almost a month ago and now I have so much energy! On the meds I was still depressed but was ok with it. off the meds, I&#039;m attacking the issues head on and trying to make up for the last 1.5 year stupor. I&#039;d just had enough of missing out on life. Good meds if you want to sleep thru life and just not have to think about issues anymore."
