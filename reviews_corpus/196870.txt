I&#039;m 18 and used to suffer from severe social and general anxiety, and mild depression. I&#039;ve had a bad past with antidepressants but I decided to try Paxil (20mg) because I was desperate. My anxiety is 95% gone, I&#039;m wanting to be more social, and I&#039;m happy all of the time! I don&#039;t worry anymore and it&#039;s amazing. There are some side effects (which were terrible the first week but reduced with time); headaches, reduced libido, tiredness, smaller apetite {I&#039;m thankful for this one}, and insomnia.
Paxil works amazing for my anxiety and I&#039;m so happy I tried it. I&#039;m making new friends and I think I&#039;ll secure a job soon :)."
