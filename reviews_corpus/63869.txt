"Nothing to share only the fact that I shouldn&#039;t have taken this so called drug in the first place and I&#039;ve learnt now to read the leaflet before putting anything into my system. This drug has screwed me around felt like I was dying with all the symptoms. Glad I was only on it for less than a month and got off it cold turkey and feel heaps good now. I don&#039;t suggest this drug to anybody if u are having depression or anything else. Seek some counselling. This is the worse thing u could put ur body through.!"
