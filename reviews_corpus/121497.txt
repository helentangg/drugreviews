"I have been taking venlaxafine for 4 days now. I currently am on a 75mg a day dose which my doctor put me on. Day 1 didn&#039;t notice anything at all, on the second day I felt a lot more relaxed but totally suppressed my appetite all day and have had a rubbish sleeping pattern ever since. Haven&#039;t really done much for my anxiety as of yet but very relaxing, will write an update shortly."
