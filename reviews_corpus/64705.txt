"Well I have been on sertraline for 9 weeks and I feel it&#039;s been a huge benefit for my social anxiety ,
 I&#039;ve always been a generally shy person but in the last 3 weeks especially I&#039;ve been seeing a huge increase in confidence in different social environments.
I haven&#039;t had a panic attack in 9 weeks which is rare and I believe that is due to this medication and it&#039;s positive effects that it&#039;s having on my overall outlook on life.

It hasn&#039;t all been plain sailing though, the first 2 weeks especially where quite rough with headaches and some heart palpitations, but the worst thing I found where the excessive sweating which still happens now.

I stared on 25mg for the 1st 4 weeks now on 50mg. Benefits outweigh the negatives. Stick with it."
