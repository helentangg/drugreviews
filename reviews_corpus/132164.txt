"I have found Effexor and therapy to be a fantastic combination. The Effexor alone has kept me from feeling like I&#039;m going to climb the walls. I didn&#039;t lose any weight on Effexor. I actually gained some (in part due to my own lack of exercise). I weened off for about a year while I was pregnant. Withdrawals can be rough but not impossible. My advise is to ween VERY slowly. I went from 75 mg daily to 37.5 daily. Then to 37.5 every other day, then every two days, then every three days, etc. until I was taking it once a week then stopped."
