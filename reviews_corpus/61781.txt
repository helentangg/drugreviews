"I started Celexa after trying many other meds for Generalized Anxiety Disorder.  I can&#039;t begin to say how much I love it.  It&#039; truly has given me a life I never knew.  I feel so much better and things now roll off instead of driving me insane!  Best decision I ever made.  Really need to give it a good two months.  That&#039;s when I really noticed the change."
