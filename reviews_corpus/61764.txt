"My depression and anxiety began when I was about 25.  It just got worse and worse until I decided to see a doctor.  I knew nothing about antidepressants at the time.  I was prescribed Lexapro and took that for about 3-4 years.  After 2 years, I think it stopped working because I would be crying and miss work all of the time, for no great reason.  
I then tried Wellbutrin, this did basically nothing for me.  I got very discouraged at the way I was feeling, and started self medicating with the wrong things.  I began Citalopram/Celexa 40mg/day.  It honestly took about a year to work well.  I don&#039;t know if it is the meds or my age (I am now 34), but life is WAY better.  My motivation still sucks, but that&#039;s just life."
