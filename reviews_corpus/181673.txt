"Prozac was the first medicine I tried for anxiety. I tend to worry a lot and obsess over things. I felt a decrease in my anxiety but it made me too lazy. I didn&#039;t want to do anything except sit on the couch and watch TV. I was even too lazy to eat which caused me to lose weight. I then tried Lexapro which I gained weight on but felt a significant decrease in anxiety and now I am on Cymbalta and do not feel a significant decrease in my anxiety and am thinking about talking to my doctor about trying something new again."
