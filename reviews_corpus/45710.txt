"After 10 years of being miserable on Celexa and then Lexapro, I was switched to 40 mg of Prozac along with 400 mg of Wellbutrin. Within a week, my mood lifted greatly. It&#039;s like the world is in color again and I&#039;ve actually got motivation to do what I need while feeling enjoyment in the things I like. I&#039;ve also stopped some compulsive habits I had, such as picking at my skin. It&#039;s been almost a month and so far no untoward side effects."
