"I&#039;m a 56 yr old male and have been suffering from anxiety and panic attacks for the last 17 years. I was taking 1mg Xanax daily which worked beautifully. In Nov 2014, 2 yrs ago, I was told I could no longer be prescribed Xanax, not a good idea to take long term. So for the last two years I tapered off down to 0.5mg Xanax a week and used herbal remedy and alcohol. As my supply of Xanax was running down to only a couple of months supply it forced me to seek help and my doc prescribed Serta a sertaline drug.  Only started taking Sertaline 4 days ago and I m struggling with the increased daily anxiety 

I realise this is a long post so I&#039;ll come to the point. When will I feel the results and do I have to keep using the dose? Thanks"
