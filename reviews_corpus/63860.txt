"I have only been on sertraline 50mg for 4 days and I am going through hell, feeling very low I really hope they work I feel terrible. I have read this will pass in time I hope so. I have had depression and aniexty for many years on all sorts of meds but I got worse so my doctor put me on sertraline."
