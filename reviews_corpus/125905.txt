"I have taken Zoloft for a while but I was packing on the pounds and noticed I was getting kind of irritable when I&#039;m normally very laid back. Doc gave me 2 sample packs of Viibryd to try. 10mg I had some stomach upset (mostly diarrhea) and an INTENSE craving for sweets/carbs. These went away eventually. Then up to the 20mg. I found that I had zero appetite and literally had to force myself to eat. Normally I&#039;d be happy about this but my mood became so dark (weeping/angry). I got to the point where I couldn&#039;t handle it anymore and had to stop. Hopefully it works better for you all! Good luck! :)"
