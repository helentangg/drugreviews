"I was nervous all day long every day, couldn&#039;t sleep at night, was having constant anxiety/panic attacks and cried all the time. 
I went to see my doctor and she prescribed Lexapro 10mg but told me to start at 5mg. I HATE being on medicine and the first few nights I was so worried about taking it the anxiety was through the roof. I decided I needed to stick with it and the first 2 weeks were awful (anxiety, nausea, no appetite, no sleep) but then day by day I started feeling better. I am at 4 weeks (still 5mgs) and realize I enjoy my days. My appetite has returned, I don&#039;t count the hours until bed, and I can relax again. I feel more like myself than i have in years. Only negative is headaches every night after I take the med. Stick with it"
