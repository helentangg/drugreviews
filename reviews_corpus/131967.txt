"I&#039;ve battled with anxiety for 10 plus years, was on medication 6 years ago for it then stopped.  I was having intense TMJ because I was constantly clenching my jaw as a coping mechanism for my anxiety. I finally decided to go on medication. My Doctor first put me on Celexa. I felt actually MORE anxious. Though it helped with my negative thoughts. I switched to Effexor. I started at 37.5 mg. I definitely feel a positive difference and my jaw clenching has completely stopped. Now I am up to 75 mg. I just feel very blah. Kind of numb, kind of &quot;dissociative&quot; like I&#039;m not present in my own body. I feel better, but I want to FEEL. I am not sure if I should up my dosage and then I&#039;ll feel &quot;normal&quot; or ween myself off."
