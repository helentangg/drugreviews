"150mg Wellbutrin seemed to have stopped working for me.(I couldn&#039;t deal with the side effects of 300mg) I was fatigued and never wanted to do anything. I also had a lot of body aches and pains. I was given brintellix and noticed a significant positive difference within the first month. I had more energy and found myself getting up and doing normal daily activities that I had stopped. I was weened off Wellbutrin and am finding myself uninterested again. I feel I have to push myself to do anything. I am going to start taking Wellbutrin again along with the brintellix. So far, I am amazed at the difference 10mg brintellix has made when taken along with just 75mg of Wellbutrin."
