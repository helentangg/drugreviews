"I was prescribed this medication to help with depression and anxiety brought on by several chronic medical conditions including Crohn&#039;s disease and Arthritis. Because of my sensitivity to meds, I was started on 5mg. I could not make it through the first week due to severe diarrhea (like taking a colonoscopy prep), severe nausea, bloating, chest pain, disrupted sleep, body aches and drowsiness. Side effects started on day one. I also had weird/ vivid dreams, but I didn&#039;t mind that. I usually try to push through in the beginning, but this was too much. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a good choice for anyone who already has GI issues. I&#039;ve tried other meds that caused mild diarrhea in the beginning that I could tolerate. This was a bad fit for me!"
