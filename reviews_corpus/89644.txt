"I was put on Celexa last Thursday due to the fact, I had a major anxiety attack while working Wednesday. Felt like I was having a heart attack, but it was anxiety due to some bad news about lay/offs at work and I have a family to provide for. My PCP prescribed me a 10mg dose of Celexa once daily, I take it before I go to bed at night so I do not feel the grogginess and give it time to work through my system during the night. I have been taking it for about 5 days, but I am feeling better already. I know it takes about a week for it to really work in your system but I have a quick reflex system so medicines absorb quicker in me. I have had a few side effects, as far as sex-drive still pretty good. Yawning is sometimes a pain."
