"I have been taking Viibryd since 1/2012. At the time I was prescribed Viibryd I had been on every SSRI antidepressant available, none of which helped the depression. Viibryd has lifted the depression. The only side effect I have is that I no longer have any emotion, although in the last 6 months I have been able to find some things funny. I am now able to function."
