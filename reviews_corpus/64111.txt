"I was prescribed Zoloft 25mg a day for Depression and Anxiety/panic attacks. I was also having severe insomnia at the time and really bad anger problems. 
From the first day I took Zoloft, my anger almost completely went away. I wasn&#039;t upset by things that normally annoyed me anymore. Another plus I noticed almost immediately was the lift in mood. I had great success raising my mood and lifting depression in the first few weeks of this drug. 
However I stopped taking Zoloft after 4 weeks because the negatives were far outweighing the positives. 
My insomnia and panic attacks got WAY worse, it was horrifying. I went to the ER because I had the worse panic of my life and thought I was dying. Sleep was impossible. Now I&#039;m trying Remeron."
