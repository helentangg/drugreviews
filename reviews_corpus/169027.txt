"I have had major depression or Treatment-resistant depression for 19 years. I have tried every medication.  I have tried every combination of medications and coming up in September I will have had done ECT for three years.  I started Viibryd 5 weeks ago and it has been amazing I feel like I am living, which is really strange to say! I feel like I have a future and I and so excited about it! It is to early to say if this medication will continue working for me but I really hope it does and it is an incredible feeling."
