"Took Viibryd for MDD. Had bad symptoms if I was a little late taking the med each day. Was actually without it for a day and a half, because I was homeas I was sick and couldn&#039;t get to the pharmacy, and thought I was going to lose my mind. My whole body itched, I was flushed, nauseated, couldn&#039;t concentrate, my heart felt like it was going to beat out of my chest. I was sicker from not taking the medication, then from the flu I was home sick with!! I called my psychiatrist and told him I wanted off the medication. Explained what happened, and we tapered me down. It took about 3 weeks, and it wasn&#039;t fun, but I would NOT recommend this mediation for that reason alone."
