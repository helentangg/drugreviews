"I&#039;ve been taking this medication for almost two years. Since on it, I&#039;ve become a completely different person. I am so happy to be me. The only problems with it that I am starting to realize is that I grind my teeth at night and I&#039;ve gained 10 pounds since starting it. I exercise and eat right too. It&#039;s a constant struggle just to lose a few pounds. Then again some people lose weight on it and some people notice no change in their weight."
