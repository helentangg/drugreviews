"This medicine is amazing! I have suffered from a bulging disc and facet joint issues for a year with little lasting relief from injections. I was prescribed Cymbalta a little over a month ago and by the 3rd or 4th day on it I was almost literally pain free. I was afraid to say it out loud for fear that I would jinx myself because it was almost too good to be true. Now after being on it for 5 weeks I can workout and get back into my exercise regimen with little to no pain. This has truly been a lifesaver! I did have tiredness and low motivation during the first two weeks, but my body seems very acclimated to it now. I do sweat a lot at night, but I can live with it. Love this medication."
