"I have been on 50mg of Sertraline for almost 4 weeks now for anxiety, not depression. The last two weeks have been hell. I am having horrible side effects; worse anxiety, heart palpitations, light weight gain, insomnia, no sex drive, EXCESSIVE sweating (palms, face, and feet), numbness in my hands, bad negative thoughts about dying (never had this before) and pain in my neck. I have decided today that I am going to stop taking this, I feel worse taking this than I did before. The only reason I started taking this was because of my breathing. This is my story, although it doesn&#039;t work for me, it may work for someone else."
