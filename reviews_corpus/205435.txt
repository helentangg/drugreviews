"The first two days on Pristiq I felt really heavy and out of it. I knew it was working when the initial shock to my body passed - I was ready to give something a chance for my anxiety and major depression. So, two weeks on it I&#039;m starting to feel a lot happier. but there has been some slight apprehension along the way due to some side effects: constipation and worried about other potential SE&#039;s from SNRI&#039;s but this medication seems to be pretty mild (50mg) and has been helping to level out my Serotonin - norepinephrine levels."
