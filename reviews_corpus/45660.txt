"I have been on this medication for 3 months now.  Mainly taking it to reduce PMS symptoms and it is working.  The first few weeks I felt really tired, not hungry, and just all over weird.  After the first month, those side effects subsided.  I have not gained any weight and do not have those &quot;moments of rage&quot; I would get before my period.  I don&#039;t plan on being on it forever but I will take it as long as I see fit."
