"Zoloft has been a complete hell for two months and a half. I&#039;ve tried to up the dose to 75 as I was taking 50. With no results, but it made me dizzy to the point I couldn&#039;t drive, nauseous and exhausted. Also, this medication has increased my social phobia. A complete hell. To those thinking on taking Zoloft, please consider other options. I&#039;ve never felt so bad in my entire life. 
Now changing to Prozac."
