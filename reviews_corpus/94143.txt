"Just started it a few days ago. Feel a bit nauseated for an hour or 2 after taking it and then it goes away. I&#039;m starting to feel better already. Wasn&#039;t expecting the price to be so high when I got to the pharmacy. I am taking it with 75mg of Effexor XR and Xanax for my very severe anxiety when needed. Hopefully it&#039;s a good combo. Just wish it was cheaper!"
