"I have been on Effexor for about 2 years and am now coming off it. I have been taking 75mg once per day. I have gained 80 lbs in the years I have been taking it but since I cut back I have lost ten in about a month. My sex drive has gone from almost every night to maybe twice a month (most of the time my mood had mellowed out)."
