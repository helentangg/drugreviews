"I used to be on 200mg of sertraline but after 12 years on this medicine I started having severe problems with anxiety after a good friend&#039;s death, this eventually led to a near breakdown 3 years later when my anxiety became so bad I could barely function.  My Dr suggested I switch to escitalopram.  I was terrified of making this switch &amp; put it off for weeks but eventually decided to &#039;take the plunge&#039;. 4 days later and my anxiety levels are already reducing HUGELY! I wish I&#039;d taken this sooner &amp; can&#039;t believe how easy the switch was. I literally stopped taking my 200mg of sertraline one day and started taking 20mg of escitalopram the next. This stuff&#039;s a life saver!"
