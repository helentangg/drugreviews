"My doc and I have been playing around with different medications for my depression.  I have tried the normal like Prozac, Cymbalta, Effexor, and another one that I can&#039;t remember.  Both my normal doctor and psychiatrist both say that I am not even allowed to try Wellbutrin due to my history of epilepsy when I was a child.  NOTHING has worked until now.  My son has been dealing with medical issues that had put me into this deep depression and his recent passing kind of pushed me even further.  I was given the starter pack and the side effects haven&#039;t been that bad, a little gastrointestinal upset but that resolves quickly. I am about to start my 40mg tomorrow.  The only thing is do NOT miss a dose even by a few hours.  You will feel the withdrawal symptoms."
