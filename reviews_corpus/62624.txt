"I was in a marked crosswalk when a person ran the Red Light &amp; T-Boned me, pushing me into on-coming traffic, right in front of 2 Portland Police cars.
I was knocked out for two days in ICU.
When I woke up, I found that I could not use my Left Hand, and I WAS Left Handed.
I had other injuries too, but after being Left Handed for 60 yrs, and 32 of those years I was a Computer Designer.
After about a year of tests and 2 failed operations, none of the doctors could fix the nerve damage to my hand.
I had to retire from work. Learning only the basic skills with my right hand, which was also damaged. I became very depressed. I am now up to 80MG a day, and it has helped me a lot.
I am also on 20MG of oxycodone every 4 hours for constant pain."
