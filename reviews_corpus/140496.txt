"Started taking lexapro about 2 and half weeks ago. Started at 5mg dose and upped to 10 week later. Side effects were pretty full on after upping to 10mg. Insomnia, nausea, felt like I was on another planet, stick I out and turned a corner after 7 days on full 10mg dose. Feel good now. Has made improvement with my anxiety.....presuming this will get better with more time 4-6wks."
