"I&#039;ve been taking the 10mg dose of Lexapro for 3 weeks. I&#039;m actually quite impressed with the improvement I&#039;ve seen so far, as I&#039;ve heard you often need a solid 6 weeks to feel the effects. I no longer have this sense of dread when I wake up in the morning. I&#039;m not &quot;triggered&quot; as easily either. Something so simple like dropping a pencil would result in depressive and suicidal thoughts for hours. Now I can brush most things off without an issue. Fatigue, VERY restless legs and vomiting were rough the first 2 weeks but have subsided now. No problems with weight gain, insomnia or nightmares/hallucinations. I still have some lingering anxiety and I&#039;m hoping I&#039;ll get even more of a boost in my mood in the weeks to come, but so far so good."
