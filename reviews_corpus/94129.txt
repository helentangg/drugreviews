"Started of the 5mg Brintellix,  I usually have low blood pressure,   but noticed at first the headache and decided to monitor my blood pressure after taking the med.  Usually the headache started about 3 hours after taking it.   I took my blood pressure just to check and my BP was high  142/ 88.   My norm is 108/70, that is regularly.  I don&#039;t think I am going to be able to tolerate the discomfort it gives me with the headache and high BP,  no nausea.   I like the fact the food cravings I got on other meds is not a factor with this.  I was on Lexapro low dose for about 7 years,  but it I started to have tremors when I discontinued no tremors,  but depression and SAD returned,  so we tried Brintellix,  may have to try something else."
