"Today was my first day (10 mg) and I felt great until I felt dizzy, then like I was going to faint. Then felt like I was going to throw up. This was all at work! I never did get sick, splashed water on my face and laid down and felt better after about 30 minutes or so. The other thing is that I did not eat much today, so not sure if that was a contributing factor. 
I feel like if I can work thru these side effects, it will really help."
