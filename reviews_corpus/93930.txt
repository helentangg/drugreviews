"I have been on many antidepressants and they all make me want to snack and overeat. I gained a lot of weight on all of the other antidepressants. I was so tired of gaining weight. About a year ago I started taking Trintellix and I am no longer craving snacks all day.  My depression was marked by feelings of irritibility and lots of crying. I feel 100% better. I think that this medication has worked better than any others I&#039;ve tried. So relieved."
