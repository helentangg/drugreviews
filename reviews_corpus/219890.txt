"I&#039;ve been taking this drug for 15 years. It saved me. Within 3 days of starting it my fog lifted (to me, the fog was like looking at life through a movie camera). The deep tissue pain went away. It has never had any affect on my sleep patterns. For the first 10 years I was able to keep it to one 10 mg pill per day. The last five, I&#039;ve had to double it to 20mg (headaches). Way back, about 3 years into this I was having trouble sleeping - quite a few nights I couldn&#039;t sleep at all, so I thought if I could take 1/2 a lorazepam it would help. Not wanting to combine the medications, I didn&#039;t take the amitriptyline for 3 nights. On the following day I was on the floor in agony. I&#039;ve NEVER missed another dose."
