"I am a 48 year old male in good shape but started experience horrible gas no matter what I ate which went on for months.  I woke up with cramps which lasted to mid morning.  I did not have constipation nor diarrhea just bad gas even on a simple diet of rice, toast and bananas.  My Dr diagnosed IBS and gave me 20mg of Amitripyline at night.  10mg for the first week then 20mg every night.  After the second week the cramping was 95% better and the gas was completely gone.  As an added benefit it took the edge off certain work related stress.  I am very happy my Dr put me on this medication."
