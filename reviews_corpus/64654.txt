"The constant stress that I was under in my marriage, caused me to suddenly just lose it (over the PTSD). I finally decided that I would get help, something that I have been reluctant to do and after seeing the doctor was told that I was severely depressed and put me on 150 milligrams of Zoloft that helped allot I&#039;m now at 200 milligrams daily. I do have breakthrough moments where I need something more the doctor prescribed me 10mg diazepam which I take at night because it makes me very sleepy, however I can still feel its effects the next day having less anxieties. I never read the side effects as I wanted this to work. I do not want to go back to the old me. I still get some bad days but they can be managed without incident."
