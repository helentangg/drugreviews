"I&#039;ve been taking Cymbalta for anxiety and dysthymia for 3 months.  It is the best medication I have tried in 10 years of treatment.  No weight gain, not as lethargic, and my attitude has been much better towards life in general.  Right now I am on 60mg a day.  I&#039;m not sure if I can go up from here but even if I don&#039;t, the way I feel now is better than anything else I have tried including prozac, lexapro, welbutrin and several others. I do have some dry mouth and sweating but it is tolerable."
