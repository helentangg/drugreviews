"This drug has changed me back to the person I recall being 20 yrs ago. For the first time in years I&#039;ve been waking up early with energy ready to take on the day. I have a 1 year old toddler and a beautiful wife and I want to be all I can for them and I don&#039;t think it would be possible without the assistance of this medication. I am also a surgeon and lead a stressful lifestyle so I need all the help I can get.

There&#039;s been a lot of trial error along the way...

My Advice: keep trying different anti-depressants and by 12 months there is a 90% chance you&#039;ll find the right one for you.

If the medication gives you a significant improvement (but falls short of 100%) stick with it and sort the rest out with psychotherapy."
