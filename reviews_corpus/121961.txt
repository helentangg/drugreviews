"I have been taking Effexor 150mg for about 5 months now. When starting this medication, I had a lot of side effects including insomnia, nausea, and severely dry mouth and very low sex drive. That went away after a couple weeks, but my anxiety hasn&#039;t been controlled as well as I&#039;d like. I&#039;ve had a couple of panic attacks and a lot of general anxiety (some situational and some not). I would probably like to consider switching to some other medication but I am scared to because of the horror stories of withdrawl symptoms.  I was previously taking Celexa for 10 years which never worked the same once I restarted it after having a baby."
