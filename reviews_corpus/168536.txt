"I&#039;ve spent so many years batting crippling depression, and trying almost every medication on the market. I know the feeling of sleeping for 12 hours and not getting anything accomplished because depression controls everything you do... 
After trying multiple medications and seeing multiple doctors, I FINALLY found a Psychiatrist that suggested I try an MAOI. Parnate has been a miracle for me. It knocked my depression out of the park! I&#039;ve been on Parnate for 3 months (with a combination of Lamictal) and my life has completely changed for the better.
