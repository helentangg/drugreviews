"I&#039;ve been on Lexapro for about 2 weeks and I feel amazing! Not only has my anxiety decreased but my mood swings have also decreased. I&#039;m experiencing some night sweats but that&#039;s nothing compared to the anxiety attacks I was having before. I&#039;ve also noticed that I have little desire to smoke cigarettes and no desire to drink anymore. Lexapro has given me my life back! Taking for depression due to Bipolar."
