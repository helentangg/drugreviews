"I was prescribed Cymbalta for sciatic nerve pain in my lower back. I had severe pain down my left leg, surges of heat in my left foot and numbness down the leftside of my lower body. I was in physical therapy, which helped, but I couldn&#039;t make it through an 8 hour workday without leaving in pain. 

My neurologist prescribed Cymbalta and said that it might also help with my bouts of depression and anxiety.

I started on 30mg and upped to 60mg to increase the effect. I&#039;ve never been happier and now I can live a normal life. I will get some sciatic nerve pain at night still.

I do get terrible night sweats. I also get &quot;brain zaps&quot; occasionally (search the web for that one). I&#039;m concerned about getting off the drug as I&#039;ve read horror stories."
