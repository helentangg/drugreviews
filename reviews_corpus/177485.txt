"Was given since having major depression in August (this is March). I have arthritis which pain has gotten much worse, fibromyalgia worse, brain fog, very weird dreams. I awoke at 2 or 3 and can&#039;t get back to sleep. During day I fight to stay awake. I have started having a very bad temper and feel angry all the time.  Eye sight blurry, clumsy. I see the GP tomorrow for a different reason (or is it?) and will demand to be taken off of this. I feel this should be taken off the market, it&#039;s side effects are horrible!"
