"I have to share my experience. I have developed anxiety over the last few months. Small panic attacks, moody behavior. My Doctor prescribed me the 4 week introduction pack 10mg I must be super sensitive. I took one pill and within an hour I was unable to function. Severe mania, made my anxiety worse. My eyes started to get really sensitive. This is the day after and I am still suffering. "
