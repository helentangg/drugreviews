"I wanted to share my experience - the first week or so of this generic Prozac was a living hell. I didn&#039;t feel like myself at all - physically and mentally. This is where a lot of people give up on this medication - don&#039;t. About a month went by and I am SO grateful, I 100% know that this medication saved my life. I am writing a review because I am now broke and couldn&#039;t take my medicine today... ONE day off this medicine made me immediately feel like my old, depressed and suicidal self again. I am addicted to Fluoxetine, but I&#039;m okay with that. it&#039;s been months since I started - almost a year. This may not be the best thing for my body, I haven&#039;t done much research... but I don&#039;t know what I would do, mentally, without it."
