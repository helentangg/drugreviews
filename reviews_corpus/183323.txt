"I took Cymbalta for fibromyalgia for about 2 years. I started on 30mg a day and it slowly stopped being effective so I then was boosted to 60mg a day. By the end of the two years I was taking 90mg a day and it was no longer working. I was devastated that it stopped working because when it did work it was great."
