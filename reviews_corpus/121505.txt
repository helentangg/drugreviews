"I had been on 75mg of Venlafaxine for the last 2 months and within days noticed a huge difference from the Citalopram I was taking before.
On Monday I had my 2 month review at the Doctors and although It has made a huge difference I still felt it wasn&#039;t quite enough so he upped my does to 150mg and I have to say its made all the difference. 
The reason I haven&#039;t given this drug a 10 is like everyone else has said ....... I missed 1 75mg tablet one night and OMG the next day I was like a woman possessed !!! Raging temper flying of the handle at the slightest thing.
I find personally it helps to be taken 1 hour before wanting to go to bed as it helps me sleep and I wake up with no side affects."
