"I went through a full hysterectomy and ovariectomy in my early 40&#039;s due to positive BRCA 2 breast cancer and double mastectomy at 30 years.  After the hysterectomy/ovariectomy the hot flashes and night sweats hit me like a mack truck. I was exhausted and gained a quick 40 lbs.  Surgically induced menopause makes these symptoms unbearable. My doctor recommended an anti-depressant (effexor) but I was totally against it as I did not want stigma of depression on my medical records. I eventually gave in and OMG what a relief it was almost instantly.  I have unfortunately had my prescription run out on 2 occasions and the hot flash symptoms are back w/in 2 days along with jitters and a bit of anxiety among other issues! This stuff is a life saver"
