"I&#039;ve been on 40 mg viibryd for 8 mos.  Not too many side effects..e.g. no dry mouth, no nightmares, no high anxieties.  A little insomnia requiring Benadryl. I had severe diarrhea until about a week ago but it was semi-controllable with Imodium.  I feel functional but still have 2-3 day periods of depression which are difficult to wade through so it has not kept me completely stable. Missing 1 dose sends me way down within 2 days....change is very abrupt so I know the drug is working.  Day-to-day energy level only so-so on Viibryd but I think my logical thinking has improved and words are not as difficult to find as when I was on other meds. This is huge for me. I&#039;d like a little more stability but for now the plusses &gt;negatives for Viibyd"
