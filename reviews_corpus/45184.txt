"Prozac for anxiety and stress:  I started Prozac 20 mgs on January 1, 2016. I feel great so far with no anxiety and panicky feeling. Not everyday is perfect but that is life. The first two weeks on Prozac 20 mgs, it made my anxiety high, it made me nauseated, unable to eat and unable to sleep.  Since I suffer from GAD, 20 mgs suddenly stopped working and I went up to 40 mgs. 
Increased to 40 mgs, it gave me a lot of anxiety and panicky feeling again.  After one week or so, the anxiety was gone. The panicky feeling was also gone.   I have tried three other ADs and they all gave me chronic nausea and headache. However, on Prozac, I feel great. I do feel nauseas at but it is manageable. Give Prozac 7 weeks before you quit. Two thumbs up!"
