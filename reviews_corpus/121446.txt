"I have been taking SSRIs on and off since I was 28 for acute and chronic anxiety/ often exacerbated by hormone changes. They have never levelled me and often give adverse side effects but have given me time out. Since turning 40 (I&#039;m nearly 41!) I have been suffering terribly with stress induced/hormone induced anxiety and had 6 months on sertraline (the last of SSRIs I wish to ever try!). My lovely new Dr suggested venlafaxine. Now this is not a drug to mess with. I was on 150mg of sertraline, so doc felt I could happily transfer over to 1 week of 75mg venlafaxine in the am and then the same plus 75mg in evening after the first week. Woooo I was tired. Couldn&#039;t stop over sleeping but after 4 weeks feel the best I ever remember!"
