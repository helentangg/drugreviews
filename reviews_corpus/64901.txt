"I&#039;ve only been taking this medication for a few days but I already feel like I owe it a review. Been on 25mg for a week for panic disorder and it has completely changed me. Reduced the negative thoughts leading to panic, and a more secure feeling about my life in general. I have also begun to have a better quality of sleep. When you begin taking this medication you may experience slight nausea and increased panic. This is normal and goes away after a day or 2 to leave you feeling relaxed and happy. The only drawback I find to this medication is that orgasms can be too intense, other than that I couldn&#039;t recommend it enough. I&#039;ve given it an 8 rating for now as I&#039;ve yet to see how I go in the future."
