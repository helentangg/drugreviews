"Though I could only check the MDD box, I also suffered from anxiety attacks and social anxiety.  There were also several other problems that effexor XR seemed to control or help control.  Depression is painful emotionally, mentally and physically, without the some kind of relief I would have been institutionalized.  For maximum effectiveness, counseling by a person trained in all aspects of the disorder is the only one I found to help bring me back to a realistic understanding of how to heal.  Interestingly, I found several psychiatrists that attempted counseling and were totally inept in their efforts."
