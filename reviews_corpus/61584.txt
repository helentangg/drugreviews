"This drug literally saved my life. I had bad anxiety and couldn&#039;t go out of the house. I didn&#039;t want to take it at first in fear of losing control and having this drug take over my thoughts. I decided to give it a shot at 10mg... Took a few nights of sleeplessness, tossing turning, body sweats. I didn&#039;t give up on it ... Then suddenly i got used to it and had to up my dose to 20mg. I began to feel normal again. I was able to go out without feeling like I was gonna have an anxiety attack. I was able to get a job as a paramedic. Going on 4 years as a medic! No anxiety attacks! My moods have been stable. I&#039;m glad I stuck with it. I never miss a dose. Don&#039;t be ashamed or scared of your mental health. Take it seriously"
