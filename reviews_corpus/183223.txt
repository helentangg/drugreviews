"I was put on Cymbalta approximately 4 yrs ago for depression due to my spouses terminal illness.  I was experiencing lower back pain at the same time and subsequently had surgery 2 yrs ago.  During this time I tried to go off the medicine but discovered that I do have severe pain from osteoarthritis.  Went back on Cymbalta and have almost complete relief from it.  I take 60 mgs. at around 1:00 pm. Morning dosage brought diarrhea quickly and this does not cause that."
