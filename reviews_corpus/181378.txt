"I&#039;ve been on this for a year at 20mg and am so happy I chose to do so.  I was so down; couldn&#039;t sleep, not present in the moment, constantly worrying, etc.  I was very skeptical of any SSRI and prefer to go &quot;natural&quot; so I resisted.  Over a year later I feel like I have a new lif, a better future, am a better employee, spouse, parent, etc.   

I suggest using an &quot;all the above&quot; approach as part of a strategy to combat depression.  Involve a good counselor who has similar values, exercise, eat well, rest, be around supportive people, do something spiritual consistently.  I did this and my world changed for the better.  I hope it is sustainable."
