"Like everyone else out there, for 15 years I have been on and off anti-depressants, been on almost everyone of them. Been on Cymbalta 90 with trazadone and Xanax.  Back in May stopped all medicines (surgery complications), except Xanax. Severely depressed since then; constant mood swings from being happy one minute then becoming impatient and finally agitated and some rage, almost bi-polar like.  Condition got to a point where anxiety/panic attacks would leave me in mental break-down symptoms in crowded places (heart pounding, sweating, etc..) and then typical breakdowns involving sadness and suicide. I thought these symptoms were a side effect from Neurontin. Met with Psychiatrist, on Pristiq ER, Abilify and trazodone and woke up feeling great!"
