"Been on this for over 10 years. I take 2 different doses every morning - 75 mg and 37.5 mg (which was added about 3 yrs ago). While no drug is perfect, it has saved my life - both figuratively and literally. I&#039;ve had great success with this medicine. Be forewarned though about missing a day: loopy feeling, lightheaded or a weird feeling in your head (not pain), like a short buzzer effect. Over the years, if I missed a day, I actually did not feel comfortable driving. If you miss 2 days you&#039;ll experience heart palpitations and will definitely feel bad. These are the reasons why this medicine should never be suddenly stopped. The dose should gradually be lowered. Conversely, the medicine should be started on a low dose, working up as needed."
