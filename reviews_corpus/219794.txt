"Suffered migraines for 30+ years. Lots of things trigger my migraine ( broken sleep, insomnia, having the slightest headache before going to bed, heat....I could go on!!)For the last 8 years I have been taking Sumatriptan with great success. I suffer migraines 5 times a week and the doctor was worried that I was taking Sumatriptan too often. He suggested amitriptyline. The migraines have decreased by 75%. I take 10mg of amitriptyline an hour before I go to bed and I must say I am very impressed."
