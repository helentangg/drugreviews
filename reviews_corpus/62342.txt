"I have been dealing with depression and anxiety for at least 15 years.  I was always completely resistant to medication.  I felt like it was a crutch.  I should be able to be normal without having to depend on a medication.  I&#039;m starting on the fourth week of Citalopram.  I felt a difference in the first week, although I was simultaneously going down a step on the patch as well. So I was extremely irritated.  After that week though I have noticed that it has made me feel normal and in those times when I would&#039;ve spiraled downward it has helped me come back to normal SO much faster.  Where I might have been anxious and depressed over a meeting for a week, I was feeling better within the same day.  Everything doesn&#039;t seem so hopeless."
