"I was on Effexor which worked great until I went up to 150mgs and I got severe night sweats and dipped into a deep depression. My Dr. switched me to Viibryd, I was skeptical not ever hearing the name. I am almost finished with the starter pack as I am tapering off of Effexor. Everything is going great, my mood feels very stable and I don&#039;t have severe moments of hopelessness. However, since starting the 40mg dose, I have had severe insomnia and if I fall asleep I can&#039;t stay asleep for more than an hour or two. I&#039;ll be calling my doctor and hopefully going back down to 20mg. My only fear is that while I was taking 20mg of Viibryd, I was still taking a low dose of Effexor and now that I&#039;m not, I&#039;m afraid I won&#039;t have the same results on 20 mg."
