"I&#039;ve been on an effective dose (100mg or higher) for over half a year and I haven&#039;t seen any effects. My doctor first had me on lexapro, which made me nauseous, so we decided to switch to zoloft. When I first started zoloft, it gave me headaches for the first week or so, but aside from that I experienced no negative side effects. Unfortunately, I haven&#039;t experienced any positive effects either. I&#039;m on zoloft for social anxiety and mild to moderate depression.

The only other effect I&#039;ve noticed is more vivid dreams. So while I&#039;m glad that zoloft had very minimal side-effects (headaches), this just didn&#039;t work for me. I was on 100mg a day for about two months, then 150, and finally 200. I saw no change/improvement in anxiety or depression."
