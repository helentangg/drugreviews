"I was suffering from awful situational anxiety and depression, hard time fully functioning, couldn&#039;t eat, sleep, focus, cried every day, was an emotional mess. Dr put me on 20mg Paxil and told me it would take 4-6 weeks to take effect. Within a week I felt so much better. I could eat, sleep, stopped crying altogether, and stopped being constantly overly emotional.

I did sometimes have a difficult time fully accessing emotions, gained too much weight, and am having trouble with motivation so I&#039;m currently on day 4 of weaning myself off, nothing but mild side effects so far. For me Paxil was extremely helpful to get me through a very difficult time and get me back to functioning so I could keep my job and parent my children."
