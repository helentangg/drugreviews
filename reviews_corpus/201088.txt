"I have taken Zoloft since I was 21 years old. I&#039;m now 36. I&#039;ve struggled with anxiety since late in high school.  Zoloft is not the 100% answer to anxiety, but it does help. When I use it consistently it helps with anxiety attacks, helps your mind from wondering about the meaningless things around you that would normally start you on the path to another anxiety attack. If you choose to seek medical advice about taking Zoloft make sure you continuously stay on it. In my experience at times when I&#039;ve forgotten, my prescription ran out and I don&#039;t have it I&#039;ve found I&#039;m OK for 3-4 days. After several days I notice a strange dizzy spell of sorts, a pulsing in my ears, to where I just want to lie down. I&#039;m sure it&#039;s just an imbalance in my body."
