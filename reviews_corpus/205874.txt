"Just started Pristiq yesterday. I&#039;m taking it to replace Cymbalta which I gained 10-15 lbs on in two months. 60 mg of Cymbalta was awesome for my anxiety but the weight gain was antagonizing my depression. I also take 200 mg of Wellbutrin SR and have taken that for a long time. 
I&#039;ve been a little jittery since starting the Pristiq and spent some time in the bathroom last night. I&#039;m coming off Cymbalta slowly over the next week so right now it&#039;s hard to judge how the Pristiq will work. I take Xanax as needed and took some today as I was feeling tense. I attribute this to the adjustments I&#039;m making. Glad I picked Labor day weekend to make the switch. I&#039;ll keep you posted on how it goes."
