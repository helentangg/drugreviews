"I am 47 and have suffered from bouts of depression all my life but about 2 years ago I was hit with depression and panic attacks so severe, I literally wanted to die.  I tried a few medications that didn&#039;t work and then Lexapro at 10mg.  At first I was very disappointed because it didn&#039;t help, even after about 3 weeks.  Then it was increased to 20mg and I swear within about 3 days I felt like a new person. I have been on it for about 2 years.  At times, I have tried decreasing back to 10mg but I end up with the same severe depression/anxiety symptoms.  So I will be staying on 20mg.  Thank you for making something life Lexapro available to me."
