"It is by far the best drug I have been given to take care of my issues. The side effects did not last too long, maybe two weeks then everything just kept getting better. The only reason I did not give it a 10 rating is this is only the second medicine I have been on for my condition. Overall the best I have felt in the past 8 years. My doctor started me on 40mg. I take Xanax approximately 75% less than as often as I used too, so that makes me happy."
