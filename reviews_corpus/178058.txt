"Worked great on the anxiety. Was TERRIBLE for weight gain. I gained 30 lbs in 3 months and this was the only change to my routine. I was not eating more or differently. I was doing more because my arthritis hurt less. So, as far as I am concerned it was the Cymbalta.
So if feeling calmer and more able to handle stressful events is worth the extra weight, then this is a good pill.
For me, the extra 30 lbs was not OK, and it is a new experience for me. I have never had a weight gain problem before."
