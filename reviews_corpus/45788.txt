"I have been on Fluoxetine for about 3 months after being diagnosed with Dysthymia( 40 year old male ) and can positively say that it has improved my quality of life. In retrospect, I have felt &quot;dysthymic&quot; probably since early adulthood, and it took me so long to find out why I felt this way. It was only after doing my own internet searches that I found a condition which was exactly how I had been feeling for so long (..and this is the important point to note about Dysthymia - many people have it for so long, that they just accept that the depressive feelings etc. are part of their personality). I had a few side effects early on - mainly nausea, but that subsided after a couple of weeks. After a very long time in my life - I feel positive!"
