"I had been on Celexa from 2002 to 2014, 20 mg a day.
My doctor told me about Brintellix (now Trintellix) and I switched to it about 2 and half years ago.
Since I am also on Wellbutrin, I only needed 5 mg of Trintellix a day.
Can&#039;t say that it makes me feel perfect, but it helped with my depression and anxiety disorder.
Today is the first day that I have not been on Trintellix, but still on Wellbutrin and I am feeling about as even keel as I have in a while, not experiencing anxiety or depression at all.
I&#039;ll see how it goes in the next few days, but if I keep on feeling like this, I will stay just on the Wellbutrin and not go back to Trintellix."
