"Third week on prozac and I feel great. My mind is clear, I am able to focus on today and not obsess over the future, it&#039;s amazing. The first week I started on 10mg then the second at 20mg. Only side effects I had were insomnia and nausea for the first week. Still, definitely worth it for me :) I am finally present and not stuck in my mind."
