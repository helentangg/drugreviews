"Had every side effect in the beginning. Almost quit taking it. But I am so glad I stuck it out. After 9 months of being on the medication I am finally starting to feel normal again. I begin taking this after I had my second baby I suffered terrible anxiety and generalised anxiety disorder. I am still breastfeeding so that was sent me your consideration however I haven&#039;t noticed anything changing in my child whilst feeding. I am so glad I continue taking this and I have to say to anyone who is thinking about stopping due to the side effects at the start keep at it it will only be a couple of months before you start to feel better. Lexapro seriously saved my life!"
