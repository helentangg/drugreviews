"Stay away from this drug! Or at least if you have had my experience. My side effects was that I had very painful armpit boils. Never before in my life had I had them. I researched signs and symptoms online, and found Lexapro could cause them. I stopped taking Lexapro, and haven&#039;t experienced anymore. I would get one or two boils a week. They left ugly, permanent scars. Although, I&#039;ve found possible laser treatment may remove scars."
