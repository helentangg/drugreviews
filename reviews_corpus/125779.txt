"After having poor results with several antidepressants, I started Viibryd. I only need 5-10 mg to feel a profound result. I eat really clean and exercise every day, so that may be part of why I need less. My doctor actually became emotional when he said he thought this was the right drug. I was suicidal and getting up in the morning was a monumental task. I couldn&#039;t focus on my family and social anxiety was high. I prayed that my body could adjust and it has. When I occasionally up my dose I have severe diarrhea but I just take an OTC to treat it. Insomnia was a problem at first but no longer is. I don&#039;t feel totally like myself, a little drugged, and my short term memory is very challenged. But it&#039;s worth it. I can function fully now."
