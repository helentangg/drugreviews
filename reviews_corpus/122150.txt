"I&#039;ve been on Effexor XR 75 mg once a day since December 1999. I originally started taking it for depression. It has worked superbly for me.  It removed the frequent crying spells, and feelings of worthlessness, disinterest, etc.  The only side effects I had were yawning at first and vivid dreams (which can still occur).  During the fall, around September/October, I find I double my dose to 150 mg once a day. If I miss my dose, I get weird vertigo-like symptoms.  I can heartily recommend this medication to those with &#039;milder&#039; forms of depression with some anxiety. I don&#039;t care if I have to take it for the rest of my life!  I&#039;m a &#039;normal&#039; human being now!"
