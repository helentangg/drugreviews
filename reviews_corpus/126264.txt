"My doctor switched me to Viibryd due to the weight gain on Lexapro, telling me Viibryd was supposed to be considered &quot;weight neutral&quot;. I started off the first couple of months with a 20mg dose and it was a little effective, but my anxiety that the Lexapro was so effective in dealing with was back.

Last month my dosage was increased to 40mg and so far it is working well. No depression nor anxiety on this dose. Additionally, my sex drive is back and other sexual side effects are gone. However, I gotta say...it causes me upset stomach pretty often as well as diarrhea."
