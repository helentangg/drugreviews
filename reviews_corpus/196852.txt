"My husband had prostate cancer and had to have it removed. It was done in a new method where they did not have to cut nerves or uretha.  No chemo or bags for urine,  he still enjoyed sex although it was trying even with the blue pill.  A year later he started having some  panic attacks and would start crying over small things. He has always been A very outgoing person and vert talkative and joked with everyone. He retired very abruptly in a year.  I kept working for another 5 yrs.  I was noticing a change but I let it go.  If he wanted something he bought it.  If he wanted to do something he did it. If he didn&#039;t want to do something, he didnt.  He wanted a 40,ooo pickup.he bought it.  He&#039;s always loved to play poker.  I hate this man now."
