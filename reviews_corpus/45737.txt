"I started fluoxetine a year ago. When I was younger I had horrible excruciating stomach aches and we didn&#039;t figure out what it was until I was about 13-14 (I&#039;m 17 now). We even went as far as checking for cancer, and doing crazy tests. I pretty much self diagnosed myself because I would have this funny feeling and my heart would race before the stomach ache. I talked to my doctor and he said Fluoxetine would be the best to go on. He gave it to me November 2010 but I let my anxiety get the best of me and was to scared to take it. Then in May 2011 I decided I couldn&#039;t live my life with such pain and it had taken LOTS of effect on my school, I was rarely attending. I now have a job and I&#039;m getting better at school. My obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) habits have stopped too."
