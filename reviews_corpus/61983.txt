"Hi, I&#039;m female from UK, age 16. I was on fluoxetine for a while and whilst at first it helped with my moods but after a few months I didn&#039;t really get much out of it, anxiety and depression wise. A few months ago I was switched to citalopram and I can say it has been an absolute lifesaver. I suffer from extreme sensitivity and most stressful situations get me extremely anxious . I&#039;m not having a good time with school ATM but I&#039;m generally feeling like I can cope with it, and that I don&#039;t spiral off into mania and anxiety anymore when something bad happens. I have minimal symptoms of anxiety anymore, with heart fluttering, tummy ache and shaking almost gone when I should feel anxious. My moods have improved greatly and I love this meds."
