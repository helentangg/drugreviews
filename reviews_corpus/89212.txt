"My doctor prescribed this for my
Menopausal mood swings and headaches.  It worked for a while and then I started having profuse sweating, not that I needed any help in that department due to my hot flashes!  I would be soaked at work and if I just did the smallest chore at home.  I weaned off and am now trying Effexor."
