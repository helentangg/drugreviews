"At first, I was a little bit afraid to try Paxil after reading some reviews but I thought to myself anything has to be better than the daily stress and anxiety that I was dealing with.  I&#039;ve been on it for a month and I can absolutely say it&#039;s been a life changing experience! I no longer have daily panic attacks and I can go out in public without a care! Before Paxil, I struggled in public situations. I would often feel anxiety and if everyone was staring and judging me. But now I don&#039;t even think about it. I just go on with my business and enjoy my days! If you&#039;re struggling with daily panic attacks and anxiety like I was, I highly recommend at least giving it a try!"
