"I hate this medicine I think I ruined me I lost a year of my life on this pill I didn&#039;t do anything for my migraines at all, I slept for up to 16 hours a day on it and it made me stupid. I became a d average student my jr year of high school if I accidentally missed a days dose I would have to skip school because I would be puking all day because of it. I absolutely hate the medicine if you can&#039;t tell."
