"I have had both depression and pain for the past 20 years.  After having some rather intensive back surgery 18 months ago, I decided to switch to Cymbalta instead of the Prozac that I&#039;d been taking for many years to see if it would aid in the pain.  My initial result was hot sweats, but no other help.  I missed a day while I was on 60 mg and had vertigo and an electric twinging in my brain that actually made my vision jerk.  It went away about an hour after I took my Cymbalta.  This has since recurred every time I try to wean.  I cannot get down past 30 mg."
