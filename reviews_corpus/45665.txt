"I tried several other anti-depressants before being prescribed fluoxetine. It has really made a huge difference in my life. I used to suffer from constant anxiety, racing thoughts, depression, and suicidal thoughts. I couldn&#039;t drive a car, go grocery shopping, order fast food, leave my house, or even talk to friends and family without having a mental breakdown.  Eventually, I was completely dysfunctional and hopeless. In combination with DBT therapy, I have greatly improved.  I still have sad days, but my anxiety is pretty much non-existent.  Life is not a constant struggle.  When I first started fluoxetine, I was very nauseous and could not orgasm.  After a few days, the nausea wore off, and with practice, my sex life returned to normal."
