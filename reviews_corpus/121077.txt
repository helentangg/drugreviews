"I took Effexor for about 2 years for my panic disorder and it was a huge mistake! Effexor caused me to have violent out burst which I never had before the medicine, increased aniexty and suicidal thoughts.I thought I was doing good on the Effexor but everyone around me saw a complete change in me and it was bad. Almost 1 month  ago I was sick for 3 days and was unable to keep my Effexor down from being sick so without knowing withdrawal began which included manic behavior, crying spells, nausea, brain zaps and a suicide attempt that landed me in a mental hospital and while there detoxed from the Effexor and put on new medicine. I know Effexor has worked for a lot of people but I wanted to share my story so people will research before starting"
