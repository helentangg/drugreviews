"I started Venlafaxine 75mg SR 6 months ago. After about 3 weeks I went up to 150mg
After a few of weeks of dilated pupils, headaches, insomnia, dizziness &amp; no appetite, I definitely felt better - no more negative thought patterns &amp; meltdowns if things went wrong or work was stressful.
It did take me about 4 months for things to settle down &amp; I am now very level &amp; happy. My only advice would be to try really hard to persist with this (or any) new medication, the side effects DO subside &amp; eventually should go away as long as you take the medicine exactly as prescribed &amp; don&#039;t forget it or run out. Obviously some people have more tolerance for side effects but my GP was very supportive &amp; caring &amp; I am now a much happier &amp; contented person."
