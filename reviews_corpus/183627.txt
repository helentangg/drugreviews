"I take 120mgs per day of Cymbalta. I also have Medicare because of an accident that caused me to be disabled for the rest of my life. Medicare has a gap where for 2 months you have no drug coverage.

Taking Cymbalta I have no side effects so it&#039;s like you aren&#039;t taking a medication, because its one of those drugs that seems to work behind the scene. I ran out of Cymbalta and found out just how good it was and how it was working. I became a totally different person without Cymbalta, really bad. I am back on my Cymbalta and I have to say this... I will never ever think I can go it alone without the help of Cymbalta and I have tried so many other drugs before finding this one. A job well done to Lilly Company who makes Cymbalta. It saved me."
