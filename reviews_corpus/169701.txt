"I&#039;ve tried various medications over the counter but nothing has worked for me up till now.  
I have been on amitryptiline 10mg for a few days which has definitely helped.  My migraines make me sensitive to sound and bright light (by the way, my laptop is turned down to the lowest brightness as this is the only way I can use it!)
I&#039;ve now increased to 20mg and hoping this will help further as I still have mild to medium chronic migraine headache.  From what I have read on here, 20mg seems to be the dosage that proper relief kicks in so I am hopeful! 
It is helping with sleep but I probably need to fine tune the the time I take the pills as I felt quite sleepy this morning.  Will post update soon. Good luck all!"
