"I&#039;m currently on two benzodiazepines (xanax and klonopin) as well as lexapro, and lexapro is effectively useless. I&#039;ve been on 20 mg for a while now and so far I am still extremely depressed and experience severe suicidal thoughts multiple times a week. I absolutely CANNOT WAIT to get off of lexparo. I was better off when I wasn&#039;t on anything at all. The only thing that helps is lexapro in conjunction with 1 mg xanax, which, quite frankly, makes me feel stoned."
