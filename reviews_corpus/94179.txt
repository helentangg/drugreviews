"I have literally been on every antidepressant made over the last six years trying to get my depression and anxiety under control.  Every single time I had severe adverse side effects, except with Lexapro which worked amazing for about six months.  I had given up on medication, but my symptoms persisted and I hit a low and knew I had to do something.  I am hypersensitive to medication and because of my past side effect issues, my new PCP gave me samples of Brintellix, starting at 5 milligrams.  I immediately felt better and had zero side effects, so when I had a follow-up visit a week later she bumped it up to 10 milligrams.  Two weeks on the new dose and I feel amazing.  I feel like me again. Best med I&#039;ve used!"
