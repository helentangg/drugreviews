"I am prescribed generic Zoloft (Sertraline) 50mg once a day for anxiety and depression. I am sensitive to drugs so I only take half, 25mg. Since I&#039;ve been on it, I&#039;ve only had one or two mild panic attacks over the course of 2 years! I was having attacks 3x a week or more before taking it. It helped reduce compulsive behaviors and definitely helped my social anxiety issues IMMENSELY. Before Sertraline, I felt like I couldn&#039;t even act normal in public. For me, there is a mental as well as a physical effect. Even being in public spaces where I would normally be incredibly anxious, I feel physically better, smoother. The only side effect was a light headache that only lasted the first week. I would definitely recommend starting on a low dose!"
