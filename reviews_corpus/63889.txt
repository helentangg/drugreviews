"I have suffered from anxiety for most of my life. Over the years the stress of having a son, a demanding job made it worse. I thought my feelings were normal. Then about 4 years ago I started to feel angry all the time due to my stress and anxiety. I was prescribed prozac as I was told I was depressed. I refused to take the medication as I thought of the stigma. My racing thoughts, anxiety got worse. I finally recognized I needed help and took Zoloft. I can&#039;t believe what a difference it has made. I feel like my old self. Calm, loving and enjoying life again. It has made a huge difference in my marriage as I no longer feel so angry all the time."
