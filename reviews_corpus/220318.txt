"Although I have gained 20 lbs on this medicine I feel much better overall. I take 125mg at bedtime and haven&#039;t slept so good in 25 yrs. I started on a dosage of 25 mg which did nothing. Not even make me sleepy.  Had immediate relief after the dosage was regulated. This in conjunction with anti anxiety medication has helped tremendously. I just have to exercise daily and keep a watch over what I eat. But that is a small trade for the drastic change in my overall well being and frame of mind."
