"This medicine has been a blessing to my life.  I have been taking this medicine for 8 months and now had control on my panic attacks, agraphobia and anxiety. I personally take it at night time because I like taking medicine before going to bed.  Since the age of 10 I have been suffering from RA and now I&#039;m 29. This lead me to be depressed but I&#039;m enjoying life once again in the midst of all my complications due to RA.  I totally recommend this medicine.  In the beginning I had side effects like diarrhea but it was only for two weeks it was actually good because I lost some weight but the I gained it back again. So people do not be afraid this really can help you!"
