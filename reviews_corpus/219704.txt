"I have migraines for the past 6 years and finally found amytriptlyne 2 years ago. 90% pain relieve. But now all of sudden as Summer sets in as usual every year it becomes more frequent and more painful. I am on 25 mg. But I wonder if I can just double my dosage. Also being in the sun just a few minutes sets off headaches sometimes migraines. Am just tired of feeling sick all the time."
