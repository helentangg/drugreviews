"I got a panic attack while at the movie, I wasn&#039;t watching anything scary, it was an action movie. Anyway, I went to my boyfriends house after and had another panic attack the same night and couldn&#039;t calm down. Went to work the next day and was still on edge. I decided to go to the doctors and she gave me Lexapro. While she gave me another medicine to take with it. I decided to only take the Lexpro/Escitopram. For the following 4 weeks only on Lexapro, I was very anxious and didn&#039;t go to work, then one morning during the 4th week, I felt better and normal. 2 year&#039;s later I saw a different doctor and she put me on a cheaper version of Lexapro, but during my first month on the other medicine I had another panic attack. I am now back on Lexapro."
