"I was put on 50mg for Anxiety and minor depression 3 years ago. I took it for 2 years, and have been off it for 1. I am about to start again at 20mg daily. It was really a life saver for me. It reduced emotions without touching intellect, and I found it much easier to just roll with things. Unlike other drugs, this one didn&#039;t cause cognitive impairment or &quot;fog&quot;. I was clear headed and much less high strung. I was able to focus on work, get things done, and deal.  However, it should be noted that it doesn&#039;t select WHICH emotions it dampens..it dampens all of them. The result is that you can be somewhat &quot;cold&quot; in general. You fail to show empathy when you should. There are also sexual side effects. Orgasms lack pleasure."
