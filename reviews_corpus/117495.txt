"I&#039;ve been taking this pill among others for pain and migraines , I started with 25 mg, and it was upped to 50 because I was still in pain and having head aches, while this hasnt helped my pain, it has helped my migraines I havent had one since taking it, and I usually had one once a week, I still get head aches. Im not sure if this helps or if its my other medications. I feel like this stuff makes me dizzy when outside in the heat, I have a constant dry mouth, my sex drive in no longer alive, I cant remember things and get confused easy. But I sleep good and my head doesnt hurt... I&#039;m still in constant pain. And it seems like I have the hunger of 3 teenagers. Im 27 and have DDD, I hope I can find something that works."
