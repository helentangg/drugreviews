"I was very scared of starting Prozac because of the reviews I read. I also had tried lexapro and had major panic attacks that made me go off of it. 
I have been on Prozac for 4 weeks and am just starting to feel the benefits. I feel I can think more clearly and am not living life in constant stress or fear. I wish I started in sooner. I feel so much better almost like &quot;wow this is what life for non stresses people is like&quot; 
Side effects I experienced: 2 days out of month felt more anxious then normal and have had a little nausea but hardly any. It&#039;s been great."
