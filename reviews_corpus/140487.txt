"After struggling with severe anxiety (PTSD) and mild depression for years, Lexapro made a huge different. I had done therapy, self-help, and religion (which helped me personally), but it still seemed something just wasn&#039;t &quot;quite right.&quot;

Doctor prescribed 10mg Lexapro and I&#039;ve never felt better. The world is a different place, not scary, no depressing, just balanced, happy. The first few weeks I had severe drowsiness (I&#039;ve never slept so much in my life), and a few &quot;head shocks&quot; or &quot;exploding head&quot; events, but it wasn&#039;t too bad. The drowsiness was worse, thankfully I had a lot of work built up at my job. A month and a half later and the drowsiness has essentially subsided.

I recommend trying this drug if you have anxiety."
