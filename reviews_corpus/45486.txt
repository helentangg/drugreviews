"I have OCD and I&#039;ve been on Prozac for a short time, but it is so, so helpful. It&#039;s stemmed my obsessions a lot, to the point where I can actually focus in class and get my schoolwork done. I&#039;ve had a few side effects such as weight gain, irregular appetite, and some weird moods, but it&#039;s all worth it."
