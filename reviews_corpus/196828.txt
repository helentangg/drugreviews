"Been on Paxil for 17 years, started with 10 mg, stayed with that dosage for about 10 years. Loved it in the beginning, slept great and mood improved a bunch.

Eventually I went to 20 mg. It&#039;s worked okay over the years. I noticed some improvement with the increase, but never really significant.The transition from 10 to 20 was seamless.

Over the years I have tried to switch to other SSRIs as it seems the Paxil just wasn&#039;t doing it anymore. But none have made me sleep better than Paxil, so I always go back.

After a miserable attempt with Celexa, I&#039;m now trying 30 mg of Paxil. I never thought my dose would get so high. I&#039;m on Day 4, and other than a constant headache, I feel no changes. Hoping my mood and outlook improves one of these days."
