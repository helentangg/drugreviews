"Used it for three months. I started with 10mg/day and then it was taken down to 5mg because of vomiting and back up to 10mg. Nausea every day, vomiting nearly every day, until I got Primperan for it. It felt at first, that it is working on depression, took off the sadness and my energy came back. But after few weeks I become anxious and irritated and then came insomnia. Finally I could not fall asleep without sleepingpills and with them I slept 2-3 hours and woke up and could not fall asleep again. My doctor suggested to lifting the dose to 20mg/day. I said NO. I could not take the nausea, vomiting and sleeplessness any longer especially, when it did not even work on the depression anymore, not to mention the anxiety and lost of sexdrive."
