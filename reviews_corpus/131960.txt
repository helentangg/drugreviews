"I have been taking Effexor XR for almost two years and I love it.  I take it for anxiety, stress, and depression.  I have taken Wellbutrin and Paxil and found a little relief but nothing compared to Effexor.  After 10   years of emotional eating I have started losing that weight, 40 lbs in the past year and I haven&#039;t dieted, I still eat the foods I love but now I stop when I&#039;m no longer hungry and I feel no guilt when I eat a cookie or two or go out for an indulgent dinner.  Another plus, I actually want sex now.  For years my anxiety kept me from having any desire but now I can&#039;t get enough.  YAY!"
