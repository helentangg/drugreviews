"I suffer from major depression and many antidepressants have been of little help.  My psychiatrist recently put me on Cymbalta and it changed my life. At first it made me feel very racy and jittery but after riding that out for a bit the side effects went away.  Now, taking 60mg a day, I feel the best I&#039;ve felt in about 20 years."
