"A traumatic incident about six months ago prompted me to seek counseling.  I was diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and later depression (because of the PTSD), and after three months of appointments I finally decided to give Lexapro a try.  I&#039;m definitely not a pill person, so I was hesitant. I don&#039;t like side effects, especially nausea.  I was happy to find that the side effects were fairly mild, but my dose was also pretty mild [5mg].  I did have one really intense headache within the first few weeks, but I can&#039;t absolutely attribute that to the medicine.  Before I started taking the medicine, I was miserable (no sleep, sad, angry, etc.).  Lexapro has helped make my life more manageable.  It feels good not to be a zombie anymore."
