"I have been using amytriptyline for about 8 weeks now for chronic pain in my elbow following an injury. I started at just 10mg a night and after each 4 day period increased it by 10mg until I reached 30mg. This was on Amitrip-10. As my body adjusted the pain would return. I was suffering from dry mouth, morning drowsiness until about 10.30am and certain level of confusion. I eventually had to increase to 40mg and was doing really well - pain free for the first time in 2 years. Then the funding agency Pharmac changed the supplier and my next prescription was Amirol. I had to almost double the strength for effective relief, in spite of the claimed same dosage. So be careful if you change brands."
