"I have been ON EVERYTHING even when it was in test study, Prozac, etc.
After being  on the test study for Pristiq I begged to be put on it on a regular basis.  I sleep 7-8  hours per night uninterrupted, I am high performance on my job, I have a renewed life even including exercise.  However this medicine is a 4 tier on my Blue Cross supplemental and it is very expensive for a 90 day supply."
