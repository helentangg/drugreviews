"I started taking Lexapro about 2 1/2 years ago.  I had gone to my doctor because I was having perimenopausal symptoms, the worst of which was not sleeping.  I would have several days in a row where I couldn&#039;t sleep.  I was also having trouble controlling my anger.  The out of control rage was so unlike me.

Lexapro has been wonderful for me.  I take 10 mg once a day.  I take it in the morning.  I am not tired during the day, but now I sleep great at night.  I also have much better anger-control.  No more rages."
