"On 75 mgs once a day in the morning, and feel great! Before I suffered with panic attacks and anxiety endlessly, especially while driving and even being around strangers in a grocery store, now no anxiety at all, can now live a normal happy life. Effexor has given that to me, I probably will have to stay on it for the rest of my life and that&#039;s fine with me. Tried going off of it before for 6 years, and all my anxiety came back. Tried Celexa and that was awful major headaches with that one, also tried Wellbutrin, but I felt like I was on speed 24 hrs a day, made my anxiety go through the roof, recently in July went back to my favorite Effexor XR and feel awesome. Good luck to all of you! Anxiety is no fun."
