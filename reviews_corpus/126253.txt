"My experience is a little more indirect. My boyfriend began taking this medication about 3 weeks ago and it has drastically changed our lives. Within the first week his mood became much much better and his anxiety took a huge dive! I can&#039;t even put into words how this medicine has changed our lives. He&#039;s always been a good man but I could tell that he was lost in a cloud of depression from almost the minute I met him. His depression wasn&#039;t what you would typically think of but I could tell something was off inside of him but this medicine has given him a revived passion for all things and he is absolutely pleasant and wonderful to be around. He did have some insomnia in the beginning and gets sick if he takes too much (more than 20mg)."
