"Paxil was the first medicine I was ever diagnosed with for general anxiety and depression. Yes, the medicine did stop the anxious crazy non stop thoughts, but it also stopped everything else. I didn&#039;t care about anything &amp; nothing bothered me. There was one point I almost got fired at work (or came very close to it) &amp; I honestly did not have a nervous bone in my body, blank faced I listened to what my boss told me I did wrong &amp; said &quot;k&quot; then went on with my day. In other words, you just don&#039;t care. Paxil was very weird for me... For the first few days I would feel calm, then for about 2 days I&#039;d get this high that made me feel finally like myself again! Then I would feel like a Zombie. I felt like my mouth was glued shut &amp; couldn&#039;t laugh."
