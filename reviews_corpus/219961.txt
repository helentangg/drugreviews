"Ive had migraines at least 3 times a week since I was 5 years old, I&#039;m now 19.. I started taking these about 4-5 months ago and now i still get migraines about twice a week, BUT they are the worst migraines ive ever had in my life, im in so much pain i throw up 3-4 times with each one, all i can do is lay in the dark, cry, and try to sleep until it goes away, it usually takes around 24 hours to fade away. Ive also been expierencing hair loss and trouble urinating.. everytime i have a migraine all i can think about is how much i want to die and whats the point of living.. And for those reasons, im getting off this."
