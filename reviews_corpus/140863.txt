"I&#039;ve had depression at times in my life. Took prozac with good effect. I&#039;d been off meds for years. After a year of chronic stress, I got sick. I had lots of tests that were all normal. I developed  panic attacks from worrying about feeling sick for over a month. When I realized my nausea, lack of appetite, excessive  sleep and aches were likely due to stress, i started prozac. I was on it for a week but the panic was so bad my doc switched  me to lexapro . I have been on it 3 weeks now and the panic has stopped  and I feel pretty good. I, too, felt like I had 10 cups of coffee or speed when I started it, plus insomnia. I stuck it out thanks to these reviews. I&#039;m  glad I did. Hang in there. YouTube has good videos for anxiety help."
