"I&#039;ve been on Paroxetine for around 5 months due to extreme social anxiety, panic attacks and mild depression. The first few days I had strong heart palpitations and dizziness, and for the first two weeks was completely anxiety free but still very dizzy and constantly felt like I was going to pass out.
After the first month everything settled down and I feel great, very minimal anxiety and Im significantly happier.
The only downside to this medication for me is that if I miss a dose I will know because I become angry and my hands will shake. 
I still absolutely love what it has done for me, and the side affects are well worth it."
