"I&#039;ve never been so happy in my life. It&#039;s not a fake, life is strangely perfect happiness. It&#039;s not the &quot;I&#039;m in my head, three feet away from everything and no one knows me&quot; feeling I&#039;ve gotten from previous antidepressants. I feel balanced and for the first time in my life (I&#039;m 28, female) feel like I am actually coming from a well-grounded place. As others have said, when a dose is late or missed, the effects are pretty awful. The longer I&#039;ve been on it though they are getting less intense. The first few times I was late, I became very quickly, extremely depressed, lethargic, dizzy, nauseous and irritable. I was having shooting lightening like feelings in my brain that would cause me to stop dead in my tracks and look pretty crazy."
