"I was diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder and major depressive disorder about 9 months ago. I tried to go without medication but constantly just felt out of control. I had no motivation or interest in anything. I decided somewhat hesitantly to go on Celexa. Looking back 5 months later I can&#039;t believe how much my life has improved. I feel like myself again. There was never even a hint of cloudiness or that &quot;drugged up&quot; feeling. I just feel like me! The only side effect I really noticed was excessive yawning for the first two weeks or so and a little bit of lethargy when I switched from 20 to 40 mg. Other than that I have nothing but positive things to say!"
