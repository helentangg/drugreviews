"Feeling alive again but still having panick attacks.
I&#039;ve been on 10mg for the past month  but I noticed every time I have drinks,  the next  day I have nasty p&acirc;nic attacks. They are awful.  Its been only a month.  Does it get better after 2 months.  I like this medicine, I feel alive again. I wanna jump out of my bed and go to the gym at 6am like before! I haven&#039;t felt like this in a year! Before all I wanted to do was sleep and stay attached to my bed.  
I love this med but i think I&#039;ll need to upper the dose for my anxiety.  :&#039;("
