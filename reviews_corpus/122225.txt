"This drug decreased my hot flushes by 2/3.  I figured it would be 100% but that was probably an unreasonable expectation. I&#039;ve gone from 8-12 a day to 2-3.  I&#039;ve suffered hot flushes since 1998 and the past 6 months they have only gotten more frequent and very annoying.  My husband says I&#039;m nicer to live with after taking Effexor, so now I realize I really was irritable from the lack of sleep and night sweats this past year.  I tend to forget names or words more frequently but am not sure if the foggy brain has another cause. "
