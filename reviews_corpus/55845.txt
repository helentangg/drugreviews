"About two-three months ago I was prescribed Cymbalta for my anxiety problems (EXTREME NERVOUSNESS, nervous habits, and constant worrying). I took Cymbalta for about three-four weeks and absolutely HATED it! It made me feel horrible so I asked the doctor to prescribe me something different. He started me off on 35 mg of Effexor. I have to say, this medicine at first wasn&#039;t all that great either. For the first four to five days I was extremely angry and annoyed about EVERYTHING! I thought it was going to be hopeless but finally the Effexor got better and now I&#039;m on 75 mg a day. My mind is not constantly racing nearly as much as it used to. Every now and then when I start to have panic attacks I will have to take either o.5/1 mg of Ativan to calm me."
