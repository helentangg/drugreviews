"I was saved by this medicine. My depression was strong enough and lasting about 2 years by that time. The reason- I couldn&#039;t conceive although was eager to get a baby finally. We both were checked and diagnosed healthy. So I was really devastated when I had to start using Citalopram. I felt the effect very fast, within first days: the quality of my life changed for best. I finally felt simply normal. Nothing extra positive, just NORMAL as years ago when I coped with my life. It was exactly what I needed. And 1,5 month later I got pregnant and stopped using it. No effects from stopping, because the reason caused depression disappeared."
