"I was experiencing major anxiety which I only have when I have major life changes.  After getting engaged, moving, planning a wedding, and changing jobs the anxiety kicked in full force.  Doctor put me on Zoloft, which make me very very nauseous. Lost 10 pounds on it, was miserable as it also caused more anxiety and moodiness. Doctor gave me trials of Pristiq...AMAZING. I had not realized how closed off I was until I tried Pristiq.  It increased my ability to have relationships with friends, my fiance, and even family.  Prior to Pristiq, I was very shy and untrusting of everyone. Tried Lexapro too due to insurance requirements. Dislike - for me it caused weight gain, clench jaw, moodiness.  Long process to find the right medicine!"
