"I take amitriptyline for prevention of migraine with aura. The aura was so bad I couldn&#039;t function, dizziness/vertigo, facial numbness, vomiting, light sensitivity and forgetfulness/memory fog. Although I&#039;m not back to &quot;normal&quot; I am able to function. I still experience dizziness from time to time and my memory isn&#039;t what it used to be but overall about 85% improvement. I have experienced some weight gain from craving sweets and other junk. Also the first month I was very tired but that stopped. I&#039;m afraid to try something else because I fear the symptoms returning."
