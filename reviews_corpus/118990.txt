"I&#039;ve been taking Zoloft for six weeks so far.  I started at 12.5 mg, advanced to 25 mg and am now at 37.5 mg.  I am increasing to the 50 mg tonight.  It was difficult at first with the side effects of a very sick stomach and increased nervousness.  I see a therapist and she explained to me that my increased nervousness is a result of my anxiety about taking the medicine to begin with!  At this point, I can honestly say I feel a big difference.  I am much more calm, and I feel like my mind is getting some rest.  I used to think WAY too much about everything.  It&#039;s nice.  The side effects are going away.  The sleep isn&#039;t fantastic but I get at least 6.5 hours so I&#039;ll take it. Overall, I&#039;m very happy and looking forward to whats to come."
