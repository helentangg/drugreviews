"I&#039;ve been on Brintellix now for 6 weeks, I started on 1/2 of 5mg tablet Bc I hadn&#039;t tolerated any other SSRI. Increased to 5mg about 3 weeks ago. I&#039;ve found a new found hope in life. I had the constipation, but increased my fiber, started on Benefiber daily and increased water consumption and even have had the desire to exercise which also helps. I&#039;m sold on this medication, I haven&#039;t felt this good in years!"
