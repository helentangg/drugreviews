"I took Celexa yrs ago for mild depression &amp; it helped. Then stopped. Now I&#039;m taking 20 mg for major depression &amp; it&#039;s not doing much. The side effect is an upset stomach. I still just want to stay in bed. I also take 1 mg of Klonopin at 11:00 pm so I can sleep through the nite.  I am thinking of asking my pdoc for Wellbutrin or Effexor. I&#039;m not in a good place."
