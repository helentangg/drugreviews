"My anxiety came out of no where. I was 35 and was never depressed or had anxiety ever in my life. At first I thought I could handle it myself, just thinking to myself that my daily anxiety attacks would go away. It got to the point where I couldn&#039;t take it anymore and I tried to check myself into a psychiatric ward. Obviously they didn&#039;t think I belonged there and told me to see a psychiatrist. She prescribed me 50mg of Zoloft. The first 2 weeks were horrible. She then upped my dosage to 100mg with Xanax to help the side effects. I&#039;m at 150mg now and have never felt better in my life. My side effects were mixed, but they all go away eventually. Stick with it, it helps."
