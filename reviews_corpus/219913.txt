"Hello everyone.I was prescribed this medication,for neuropathic pain,widespread head to toe muscle and skin pain( allodynia),and vulvodynia this medication did nothing to ease my pain it just made me feel horrible, my hands and feet was burning with pain just as bad as before the medication and remained as sick as i was had disturbing nightmares with it every single night, and daytime fatigue,then was prescribed Imipramine 50mg similar medication also a tricyclic, and Wow did it take a lot of my pain away..feeling like a human again,also i sleep like a baby without having to worry about nightmares,and my bladder burning pain and urgency completely diminished.I highly advise anyone with severe pain to try Imipramine.It saved my life big time"
