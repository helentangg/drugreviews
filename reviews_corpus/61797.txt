"I am taking this drug for several of the reasons to take it. This drug is amazing! Everyone worrying in the reviews please stick with this tablet! The leaflet that comes with the box states that the drug may initially make your problem worse but this will stop happening and your condition will improve. My pharmacist also told me that this drug can take 3 WEEKS to get into your system so PLEASE give it time. This drug has given me my life back and it could do the same for you!"
