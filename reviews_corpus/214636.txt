"I have been on Lexapro 5-10 mg for 15 years and it has kept my panic attacks and GAD at bay.  Only time I have a problem is when I decide I don&#039;t need to take the medication anymore and take myself off only to find my anxiety and panic attacks begin recurring. Dumb idea! For me, it&#039;s a long, difficult period of adjustment to get on Lexapro after getting off because of the side effects and the anxiety symptoms, (nausea, no appetite, nervousness, heartburn...) but, it&#039;s so worth it after the Lexapro begins working. Aaahh!"
