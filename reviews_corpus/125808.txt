"I don&#039;t normally review medications but Viibryd is my savior! I am 21 years old with terrible anxiety and depression. I tried a medication I can&#039;t recall before Viibryd two years ago and was pretty unstable but upon being put on Viibryd I felt I could be a normal person again. Over this past summer, I was taken off of it due to insurance issues and let me warn you, even forgetting to take it, within an hour past 24 hours since ingestion I start to itch and feel overall sluggish. That is just the beginning, the further symptoms of withdrawal I faced were very vivid dreams and intense thoughts of suicide. Works great when I&#039;m on it, but the withdrawals can be harsh."
