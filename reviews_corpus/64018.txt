"I&#039;m a combat veteran with PTSD. My dose was 25mg daily for 2 weeks, then 50mg daily. I Started out with severe headaches and diarrhea for the first 2 weeks. After that the headaches went away. However, I started vomiting every night and morning. Not just minor vomiting, but exorcist looking vomiting. Sometimes about a gallon. I would fill up my toilet pretty good. The diarrhea never went away. I was constantly dehydrated. 

After a few months I couldn&#039;t take the side effects. Tapering off made my PTSD 1000% worse. I would have been better off not taking it at all.

Before you start SSRIs look up other people&#039;s horror stories. These things are worse than hardcore illegal drugs."
