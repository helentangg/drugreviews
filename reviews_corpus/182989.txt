"I have been taking Cymbalta for over 3 weeks now. I have to say it has helped with my depression. I have been suffering with depression for 2 years now and decided to get help. I am starting to feel like myself again except for some minor side effects. Constipation, nausea and headaches. Hopefully these side effects will disappear in time."
