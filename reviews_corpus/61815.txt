"I&#039;m 20 and started on Citalopram because I was having seemingly random extreme panic attacks. The first few weeks were a nightmare but once I pushed through I almost completely stabilized. I know experience mild anxiety but nothing that escalates the way it used to and I can control it. Anxiety is awful but if you can put up with those first few weeks then it helps a lot."
