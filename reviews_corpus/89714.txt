"I&#039;ve been taking Celexa for about 9 months.  I am a professional football player and developed a very unproductive phobia after a series of negative situations stressful situation. I used to execute certain plays with no problems but after I blew several games executing a particular type of play, I became fearful of this play during games, even though I could execute the play perfectly in practice.  I went on Celexa, but I don&#039;t think it helped much because the phobia is still there and I get very uncomfortable just thinking about executing this play.  I started on 10, then 20, 30, 40 and settled on 30mg.  Others around me have commented I&#039;m easier to be around but it did not help my phobia whatsoever."
