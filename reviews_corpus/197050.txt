"My Dr recently increased my dose of Paxil adding 10 mg. it has made a significant difference in the amount and severity of my hot flashes. Every day I could easily have 15 and at night sometime 10. It has been a week so far and the daily have reduced to somewhere between 5 and 8. And at night approximately 5.  I am grateful for the slight relief."
