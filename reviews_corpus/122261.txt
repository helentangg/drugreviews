"I started Effexor XR about a year ago for PTSD, and severe depression, and sleep issues. All other depression medicines (prozac, lexapro, you name it) were leaving me feeling druggy - so I was not very good at taking my medicines.  I have been consistent with Effexor this whole time, with very good progress, and suicidal events eliminated.  I have just been increased from 75mg to 150mg to aide in FMS.  I am very happy with what Effexor has done for me."
