"I have been on Fluoxetine (Generic for Sarafem) for exactly 2 years.  This medication changed my life.  I was hesitant to take it (or any medication like it) because I thought I was going to feel numb to my feelings/emotions and be a completely different person.  I have been suffering from depression &amp; PPMD for as long as I can remember.  My doctor never picked up on it and I never realized how much it was affecting my life.  I was moody, irritable, had no patience.  I would cry for no reason, have panic attacks for no reason.  I would wake up in the morning with that empty/dreadful feeling.  Everyday was a struggle.  Some days were much worse than others.  I feel SO much better now.  I really wish I started taking this sooner."
