"I have been dealing with depression since 1990 and run the whole inventory of SSRI&#039;s available.  Prozac was effective the first 2 years then became ineffective. The only drug that has helped me for an extended period of time was Paxil.  Paxil eventually became ineffective after 5 years. So the wonder drug Cymbalta comes on the scene and I thought I had finally found the magical cure. I&#039;ve been on 60 mg of Cymbalta for about a year and once again the roof is caving in and very abruptly. This past week I&#039;ve been suicidal for 3 days.  Why? The circumstances in my life that so often can trigger anxiety or depression are the same as always.  How can an SSRI become instantaneously ineffective?  I&#039;m not raving about Cymbalta any longer."
