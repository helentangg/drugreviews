"I had to write a review on this one. I have tried everything possible in the past and nothing has worked this well for me but this med. I was suffering some horrible symptoms of ptsd and it completely was dibilitating to my life, career, social life, and even started to effect my health. I had gone through a rough phase with extraordinary life circumstances as well as serious difficulty coming to terms and adjusting with drastic changes and past trauma haunting me daily, even waking up from dreams with full blown panic attacks. I feel balanced out on this med, my functioning has been restored, so relaxed and calm, able to sleep at night, no more panic, and increased resiliance to stress, please give this a try if you suffer from ptsd......"
