"I have only been on the drug (5mg) for 1 week and already feel better. I  had been having suicidal thoughts and indescribable feelings of despair but since starting this drug it is amazing how fast it has helped. I am supposed to increase to 10mg today but terrified of side effects. Weight gain is a non-negotiable for me. Zoloft worked great but I gained 15 pds in 8 months and still haven&#039;t lost it. Negatives: the cost of this drug is absurd and if I gain weight I will lose my mind. It is depression or weight gain - both awful choices.... I hope this drug works or I am done."
