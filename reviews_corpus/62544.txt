"I have struggled with anxiety/depression/insomnia my whole life. Nothing ever had any noticeable effects until I was prescribed Celexa back in 2007. I was on it for years, then decided to try life without it and was tapered off. The thing about Celexa (and all antidepressants) is they work well in that you wont spend as much time crying and all that but they also inhibit you from feeling genuine euphoria! You just stay at a base-line. "
