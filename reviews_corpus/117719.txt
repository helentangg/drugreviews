"I have suffered for years with migraines. I calculated that I lost 1 year completely to migraines every 6 years. I started Nortriptyline in Dec 2010 and have not had one migraine since then.  Even with my job stress (nursing) no headaches. Finally at 49 I have a life.  The dry mouth can be difficult at times but dry mouth or migraines, I pick dry mouth."
