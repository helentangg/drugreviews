"I&#039;m a 46 yr old female with a long history of being a control freak, unable to sleep, edgy, irritable, etc.  I&#039;ve been using 10mg of Lexapro for about 5 weeks now and the results are amazing.  I can sleep, I can focus on what&#039;s important, and I&#039;m much more even tempered.  All my close friends and my boyfriend have commented on the difference.  I haven&#039;t seen any side effects that I can&#039;t deal with yet, in fact the best one is that it makes me sleepy, so I take it at night."
