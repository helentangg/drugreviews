"This medication has worked wonders for me. For years I have been plagued with constant worry, fear of social situations, anxiety and panic attacks.  I started taking this medication after the loss of a loved one as all of the above symtoms were spiraling out of control.  What a change!  I have been taking it for about seven months with no side effects."
