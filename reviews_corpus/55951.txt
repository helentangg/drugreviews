"I have been on Effexor for 4 years.  My doctor at the time told me I was depressed but since then I was tested for severe sleep apnea. I have tried unsuccessfully 3 times to get off of it.  I was taking 150 mg.  One doctor told me to start taking the 150 every other day then eventually stop.  Horrible side effects.  Dizzy, irritable, bad dreams, sleepy and general flu like symptoms.  I wish I had been told about the possible withdrawal symptoms at the time my doctor had given it to me.  Effexor gave me sweats and I&#039;ve gained a ton of weight. My new doctor has me on Wellbutrin and is slowly lowering the dosage.  I&#039;m on 37.5 right now and so far so good."
