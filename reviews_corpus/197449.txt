"Paxil helped me eight years ago when I had postpartum depression.  I have tried twice to wean my self off the Paxil but only to come crashing down months later. I think it is important to realize that I am on Paxil because I have panic attacks and the medicine works. If I had a heart condition, I would not stop taking my medicine. Don&#039;t feel guilty that you need medicine to help your brain function. I fell into that trap twice and will remain on my medicine and be faithful in taking it. It is when you feel great that you think you don&#039;t need it. The last time I started taking the Paxil again 10mg was enough. After two days my doctor said to take 20mg and I had the three worst days of my life. Start on 10mg for a week and work up only if needed."
