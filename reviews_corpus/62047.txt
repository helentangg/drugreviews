"I started Celexa last April after having tried numerous other antidepressants. It took a good 6 weeks for me to really get the full effect of the medication, but it has changed my life.  I found it to be subtle, effective, and lasting without any side effects. I really think it&#039;s a matter of your personal brain chemistry whether an antidepressant will work for you.  It&#039;s worth it to keep trying to find one that fits for you."
