"I&#039;ve been on Zoloft for about two weeks now and I&#039;ve noticed a considerable difference in my demeanor. The very first day I took it, it upset my stomach severely. I was so nauseous and had intestinal issues...yikes. But the next day I felt great. My doctor recommended I take a half pill for the first few days. I have had some relationship issues and work issues and I suffer from anxiety and depression. I have obsessive, negative thoughts about my relationship and it was seriously impacting it. I was fighting with my partner everyday because I couldn&#039;t stop thinking about our problems. Since I&#039;ve taken the medicine, we had one fight. I do sleep a ton though I seem to be shaking that off a little. I feel like so far so good."
