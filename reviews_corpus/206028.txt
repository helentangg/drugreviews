"I&#039;ve been taking Pristiq (50 mg) for the past 8 or 9 weeks for depression. For the past 10 years, I&#039;d taken Effexor XR (450 mg) for depression and panic attacks. It completely kicked the panic.  I was also taking 450 mg of Wellbutrin SR with the Effexor and still take it along with the Pristiq. The first 4 days were awful since I had stopped the Effexor cold turkey, but after a couple of weeks, I began feeling better on the Pristiq. So far, Pristiq is working well for me, I have more energy, which is huge for me (I also have fibromyalgia and sleep disorders). "
