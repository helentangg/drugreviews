"It is... amazing. I have been on antidepressants on and off since i was 16 years old. I am now 19 any my life has completely changed around. My sleep is better, my appetite normal, my mood heightened, anxiety is away, and I don&#039;t feel as if there&#039;s something weighing down my heart. Please, if you are depressed right now, I highly recommend this medication. My dad has been using it too and he is genuinely happier with his life; i can see it in his eyes."
