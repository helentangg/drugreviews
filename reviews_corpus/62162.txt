"I had a very positive experience with citalopram. It literally saved my life when I was in the worst emotional abyss in my life. Depression is the worst illness I have experienced in my life and this particular medication worked wonders for me. It started working after about 2 weeks and I stayed on it for roughly two months. I discontinued taking the medication after just 2 months because I did not want to become addicted to it and living on medication for the rest of my life was a scary concept. The only main side effect I experiences was loss of sleep while I was taking the medication. I am doing fine for now but if at any point I experience the symptoms coming back, I&#039;ll be happy to get back on this medication."
