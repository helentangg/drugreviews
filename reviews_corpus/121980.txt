"I&#039;m a 24 year old female with major depression and anxiety. I&#039;ve been on nearly every antidepressant I can think of (Prozac, Cymbalta, Abilify, Lexapro...and even a few others) and Effexor has been the only one thus far to be effective. The others either made me an emotionless zombie, or didn&#039;t do anything at all. The only side effects I&#039;ve had were a bit of shakiness for the first week I started taking it, along with some dry mouth. These only lasted a week while my body got used to the medicine. I&#039;ve had no changes in weight or appetite, which I know is a common concern with this class of drugs. If you&#039;ve been through the ringer trying to find an antidepressant, I would recommend this to anyone. I also take Buspar daily."
