"I&#039;ve suffered from dysthymia and depression for years but never knew what I could do about it as my insurance does not cover mental health. I finally askedy gp if she had any suggestions and she informed me that Walmart has some $4 generics. So she put me on citalopram 20mg. The difference in the beginning was definitely a step in the right direction. 6 weeks later she bumped me up to 40mg. The change was amazing. Not only did I notice a difference in my attitude, my energy levels, my overall mood, so did others. My depression had impacted my work and personal life severely. People remarked how much they notice I&#039;ve changed. I tried switching to Paxil at one point but that was awful. I went back to Celexa and that&#039;s where I&#039;m staying!"
