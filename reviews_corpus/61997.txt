"I was only able to take this medication for about a week, due to a severe allergic reaction I developed. I had horrible, blotchy red hives all over my body, and right after taking them the last day, I also had trouble breathing. Even before I developed the rash, however, I knew something was off. I had terrible insomnia; hardly slept the whole week, not to mention, I felt like I was numb, as if I had thrown a veil over my emotions. It was a little unsettling. I wasn&#039;t anxious in the least, but I wasn&#039;t particularly happy either. I didn&#039;t feel anything. My house could have burned down, and I wouldn&#039;t have cared."
