"Like many others have written, this drug has dramatically improved my quality of life. I have been taking it for about 1 year and have been too busy feeling good to write a review.
Before: I was plagued with extreme panic, afraid to be alone, afraid to take a shower, constantly worrying, &quot;what if&quot; scenarios, thought I would have to quit my job, lost weight because of NO appetite.
Now: all I can say is pretty much living like a normal person! I do feel anxious at times, but I didn&#039;t want to turn into a robot w no feelings! I am thriving at work, socially have made new friends, can concentrate so well (this might be my favorite part), no sexual side effects whatsoever, weight maintained at a healthy level. 5mg 

I am so thankful for this drug"
