"I love this medication for the positive affects as far as helping my depression and such. I have been on it for over 10 years. I thought about getting off of it a few years ago and had horrible withdrawal symptoms. It is almost like electricity running through your head and face. If I miss two doses I am flat on my back sick. I can&#039;t keep my eyes open because of the visual disturbances. Its like all of my senses are heightened and when I move my head it almost feels like everything kind of moves with a short shift. Needless to say. I didn&#039;t get off of it. It is really strange. The withdrawal  symptoms lasted more than a week and didn&#039;t improve until I started taking it again."
