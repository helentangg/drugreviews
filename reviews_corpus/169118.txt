"I have been taking this since March in the mornings. 20mg. Almost everything else gave me horrid side effects. I also take 30mg Remeron at night. Thanks to those who gave the heads-up about peanut butter, protein, beans will work in a pinch I discovered. That made the stomach problems go away like magic! Still depressed, but getting better, this is the 1st time that any medicine has worked. I have been depressed for years. I can now laugh again, hope this works for a long time."
