"The first 2 weeks are the worst. I had lots of tummy issues but resolved with time. I&#039;m on month 2 now and It&#039;s working better then any other medications I have tried. (I have tried them all with only Effexor being the only one the actually worked) its costly but I hope with time the price will come down. (About 200 a month with Insurance) but its working so it&#039;s worth it!"
