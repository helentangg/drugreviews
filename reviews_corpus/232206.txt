"Took a single Paxil pill and felt immediately sick within two hours or taking it. This &quot;sick&quot; feeling lasted for a solid week. I thought that I probably just got the flu at the same time I started taking Paxil, so I tried it again. Nope, still made me feel sick. I didn&#039;t think it was possible to get every single common side effect listed from taking one pill, but I guess I was wrong."
