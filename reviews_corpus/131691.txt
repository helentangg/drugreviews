"My experience was a waking nightmare... I was started on a low dose to treat anxiety.. It didn&#039;t help at all. My DR kept slowly increasing my dose while I suffered from extreme anxiety with no relief.. I had weight gain, night sweats, oddly long menstrual  cycles, cramps, the urge to drink alcohol.  I went to another Dr that said the dose needed to be at least 225 to treat anxiety I was on 125 so he increased dosage. This made the side effects much worse and the weight gain. I didn&#039;t care about anything, I wasn&#039;t myself. I decided after 20 lb gain to stop and got tapered off. I became extremely ill it was like having the flu everyday for weeks. I&#039;ve been completely off a few weeks now I have headaches still and extreme anger like rage."
