"I tried at least 7 or 8 &quot;traditional&quot; antidepressants. They never worked at all. Quite the opposite; I had to take benzo because I became tremendously violent and aggressive. My doctor finally decided that he had no option but to prescribe Parnate, for which you need a special license in my country. What a difference! Finally no depression, no aggression nothing. Just feeling good. I didn&acute;t feel drugged up, just felt like me myself. Wonderful feeling! Yes I do miss cheese sandwiches and I have to take sleeping pills, but it&acute;s so worth it."
