"I took Paxil for a total of 10 years for anxiety and panic attacks. I was put on it at a young age, but I don&#039;t see how I could have gotten through those ten years without it. Paxil is great and works wonders for anxiety, but I didn&#039;t want to be on it my whole life. I&#039;m now 20 and doing great without it. I think the medicine gave me a sense of confidence after a while that made me realize I could get through my anxiety on my own. A confidence that helped me find my own coping mechanisms for my anxiety so that I no longer needed to rely on the Paxil anymore. I highly suggest Paxil to anyone with anxiety disorder looking for a medication to help."
