"I&rsquo;m a Type 1 Diabetic for 39 years. Had VERY painful muscle spasms/seizing and twitching. I tried various supplements which &quot;should&quot; have helped but no improvement. I started Neurontin at  1,800mg/day and I had terrible swelling plus gained 18 lbs in 6 months (and my eating habits actually got better while on it). The 1,800mg of Neurontin no longer controlled the muscle spasms. I started Cymbalta, 30 mg before bed, and had significant reduction in pain the first morning. I did notice a very strong headache that first day.  I had only 3-4 muscle spasms that first day as well....Wow!!  Second day...almost NO pain in the morning and only a dull headache with much weaker muscle spasms.
Side effects: Crazy dreams, difficulty sleeping, headache."
