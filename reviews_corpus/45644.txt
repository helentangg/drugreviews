"Many people say that they gained weight on this medication. I actually lost weight. I lost 11 pounds in a little over a month that I&#039;ve been on it. I have few side effects. The only thing I can complain about is that it makes me very sleepy, but it takes away the depression, so I&#039;m grateful."
