"I started taking Zoloft a little over a week ago. At first I got really, had dizzy spells and nausea. Then I found out the doctor gave me 100mg to start and that was way too high of a dosage. I started breaking them into quarters and so far so good. Side effects since the change in dosage: I&#039;ve suffered loss of appetite, very little food makes me full. Other than that, I think it may be working, but too soon to say for now."
