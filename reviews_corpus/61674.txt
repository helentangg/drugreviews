"Celexa has changed my life. The first couple days I was yawning uncontrollably which is a rare side effect. After that I started to feel like a robot almost. I just did things, I didn&#039;t think too much about anything. I guess maybe that&#039;s why it helps with depression. But not only does it suppress the bad thoughts. It also suppresses the positive and creative thoughts."
