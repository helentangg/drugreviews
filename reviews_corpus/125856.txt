"I can live again!! I have suffered from anxiety and depression for 12 years. I&#039;ve tried it all... most recently I was on Celexa and Lamictal  combination. I took Celexa for 2 years and then things went south again. My doctor mentioned Viibyd and I was so scared to try a new medication because depression meds are a game of Russian roulette. I went straight to 40mg a day and I am happy to say that after just a week, I feel awesome. I forgot how it felt to be &quot;normal&quot;. And i am high on life after finally finding a solution! Only side effects are occasional brain fog and a little bit of restless legs.   Every medication is different for every one. Just keep trying until you find yours and don&#039;t give up."
