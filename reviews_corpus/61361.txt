"I suffer from anxiety/depression decided to go to the doctor after sometime being that I just couldn&#039;t handle it anymore without some kind of meds. They started me on 20 mg which seemed to help but not quite to 100% yet! She then had me take 30 mg for a week and bumped it up to 40 mg but honestly it&#039;s to much I literally feel like I&#039;m just &quot;there&quot; I feel physically exhausted it&#039;s a bad feeling and I&#039;m still dealing with day to day anxiety but definitely not as bad as it was. I&#039;m going to go back to 20 mg till I see my doctor again. Hate this awful feeling I have almost like a zombie it&#039;s like my brain is in a fog or something. I&#039;m hoping she can add something to it I definitely can&#039;t go any higher then 20 mg"
