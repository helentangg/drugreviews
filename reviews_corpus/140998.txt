"I was prescribed this drug for mild depression 4 years ago. I had 0 side effects   0 benefits - it was when I took the drug again years later I realised why it hadn&#039;t worked - I didn&#039;t need it then, my serotonin levels must have been ok. 7 months ago I began getting debilitating panic attacks that ruined my first post college job. Anxiety took over. I was prescribed lexapro. In the first week I won&#039;t lie I was very ill with nausea   increased panic. I was convinced I should stop. I read review after review terrified but I stuck it out. It has saved my life and my mind. Remember initial side effects mean the drug is doing something to your body that wasn&#039;t happening -more serotonin! I&#039;m slowly rebuilding what anxiety destroyed thanks to lexapro"
