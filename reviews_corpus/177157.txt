"Started on 30 mg XR. Didn&#039;t make it passed 3 days. This drug was really hard on my body. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, excruciating acid reflux, sweating, pupil dilation, tremors and depersonalization were all experienced. The only way this drug would be helpful would be is if they made it in smaller doses.

It did, however, help my nerve pain. The pamphlet says specifically not to open the capsule and dump out some of the enteric coated beads, but this is the only way I could see this drug being tolerable."
