"30/F. I developed severe anxiety due to obsessive &quot;bang your head against a wall to make it stop&quot; intrusive thoughts at age 7. I &quot;grew out&quot; of it as I got older, but it hit back in full swing at 18. After years of walking around with a constant stomachache and having obsessive thought-induced panic attacks (all while living a &quot;normal&quot; life) I finally went to see a doctor. I started out at 50mg and later bumped up to 100. First few days felt like I had mild morning sickness and brain fog, but faded quickly. The only real lasting symptom is restless legs/sleeplessness at night, and I&#039;d rather be awake and restless than awake and hysterical. I do think about/initiate sex less, but have found that (for me) getting started anyway does the trick."
