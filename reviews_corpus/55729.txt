"I am now in the final phases of weaning off effexor. When I started this drug I thought it was amazing, it was a miracle drug I wasn&#039;t having my usual major mood swings and panic attacks were less, but as the weeks went on it was less an less effective. I missed a pill once and made sure that I never did again because of the immediate withdrawal I had felt worse than I ever had before. About 4 months into taking this drug I started to experience side effects and oh man are they awful! I mistook the side effects and thought increasing the dose would fix the issue, but nope it just increased the severity .So now I am in the final stages of discontinuing effexor and I feel awful. I wouldn&#039;t advise not taking the drug, as it works great for some."
