"The first week and a half I started 5mg of Lexapro was a nightmare.  I would have a psychedelic experience each night when I would try to sleep.  It was like my mind was wondering through the expanse of the universe.  Very trippy.  However, after that first week or so, that feeling went away and it has been nothing less than a miracle for anxiety.  Ever since my best friend was killed in a head on collision with a drunk driver 4 years ago, I had been extremely worried and anxious that the same scenario would play out with another loved one.  I would obsess over this daily and was driving myself crazy.  Now that I&#039;m on Lexapro, I don&#039;t have those feelings anymore.  Sure, I worry about things sometimes, but now I&#039;m free from obsessing."
