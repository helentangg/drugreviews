"I started taking Lexapro about 7 weeks ago after an extremely traumatic unexpected loss of my long term boyfriend who i lived with. I was not functioning or able to deal with life before I got on Lexapro. I couldn&#039;t  stop overwhelming thoughts, anxiety, crying.  I couldn&#039;t face life.  Lexapro has helped me begin the process of healing In a healthy way and resume life. I don&#039;t feel any different other than I have rational thoughts and I am in control of my emotions. I know I would not be moving forward in a positive manner of it wasn&#039;t for this medication.  The change was like day and night and I am thankful."
