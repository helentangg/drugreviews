"Works great for my general anxiety.  I felt like I was trapped in my own body.  Couldn&#039;t breathe regular, fidgety, brain racing nonstop, chest pain, couldn&#039;t sleep, had to run up and down stairs to relax.  After 2 months I started to feel a difference.  Takes the edge off is all.  Doesn&#039;t change my mood, doesn&#039;t make me sleepy.  Only side effect I have is sometimes an hour or so after taking stomach is a little upset....minor tradeoff for being anxiety free.  Changed my life.  If you are living under a constant cloud of anxiety, please consider this medication.  It takes a while to really start working, but for me it has been a saviour."
