"Having nauseous feelings, dizziness, clouded distorted head as if hung over, every day at noon time and lasting rest of day!
Just started taking 30mg at night along with Wellbutrin and trazadone that I have taken for a couple years now.
Not a good feeling. Going to call Dr to see what I should do."
