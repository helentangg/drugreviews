"I was an Celexa until my doctor decided to switch me to Pristiq due to some unwanted side effects that Celexa brings. After a week of being on it I literally lost my mind. I became extremely suicidal. I was very hostile and irritable. I immediately went back to the doctor and he put me back on Celexa and I&#039;m happy with it."
