"After I had kids I started getting migraines. I&#039;ve had them for over 5 yrs. I started taking this medication and I&#039;ve been on them for a little over a month. The first few days (2 or 3) I slept like a rock. I even felt weird like I was in a dream. Those side effects went away after the third day. I haven&#039;t had 1 migraine since I started taking this medication, and I&#039;m able to sleep through the night too. I would recommend this to anyone with migraines."
