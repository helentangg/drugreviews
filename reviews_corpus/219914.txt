"I had headaches for a year. At six months I switched my allergy meds, relief cut the headache intensity by half. The rest of the cause was minor concussion as a result of an auto accident and overdoing( occasionally overdosing) of OTC pain relievers ( Tylenol and aspirin). Started elavil almost 3 months ago, I am now mostly headache free with only slight headaches and off all OTC pain relief.
OTC pain relievers can be addictive and by reducing how much per day I took, I am now taking OTC pain relievers for minor muscle and joint problems as needed (which is only occasionally). 
Looking forward to stop using elavil every day. Some tips listen to your doctor, keep a log or journal of progress and remember not thinking always about a headache"
