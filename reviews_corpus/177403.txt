"Duloxetine is the generic to Cymbalta. Insurance will not cover the miracle drug Cymbalta which I used to use for chronic  pain and depression until CDPHP dropped it from coverage. Duloxetine has severe side effects and will make you grow man boobs. The manufacture of Duloxetine says it might happen, but they don&#039;t care nor does CDPHP  because its too hard to prove it. I&#039;ve been on it only for 2 years because CDPHP drop Cymbalta which I&#039;ve been on since entering the market with other so-so  anti-depression meds for chronic pain from a broken neck."
