"Just an FYI.  Not all anxiety medications work for everyone.  This one works amazingly for me but works horribly for a good friend of mine.   She took a test to determine what medication was best for her and was able to find the best match.  If you are on a medication that isn&#039;t working don&#039;t give up hope, ask to do the test and try something until you find one that works for you.  If your doctor isn&#039;t accommodating look for another one.  Cheers."
