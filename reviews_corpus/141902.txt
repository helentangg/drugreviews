"I&#039;ve been taking Lexapro since November of last year (2009) and it works great!  I used to get really nervous entering a room or place with large crowds and now it&#039;s easy being the center of attention, especially me wanting to be an actress and all...it really helps! I&#039;m the person I&#039;ve always wanted to be...confident, outgoing, and alot of other things.  Although, It would be great if I could do this without the medicine, however, I had tried getting off of it and the anxiety came right back. So, it just works great.  I don&#039;t get nervous or embarrassed easily anymore.  I&#039;m not as moody either...it helps with that.  What more can I say?  If you suffer from anxiety, this is great! I no longer have panic attacks either."
