"I have suffered with depression for 5 years now and over those years have tried citalopram, fluoxetine and now sertraline. I can&#039;t stress how great sertraline has made me feel. I have lost over a stone in weight in the past month because I have felt so much better in myself. I have been on them since August 2011 and I feel much more relaxed, less panicky and a lot more lively. I finally feel like me again, and I&#039;m loving it! No side effects except for weight loss."
