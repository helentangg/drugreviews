"I literally thought there was 0 hope for me. My anxiety has increased drastically as I&#039;ve gotten older and has led to social anxiety. Going out in public would depress me, I constantly thought people were plotting against me and talking about me. I have been on Paxil for about a month. Thank God. My work days are MUCH better, I don&#039;t analyze the hell out of everything and I&#039;m not afraid of people. I can now get out of bed and look forward to the day, not dread it."
