"I have been suffering with my migraines and daily headaches since I was a child, I am now 34. I have tried Tramadol (sometimes REALLY good but other times gave me a worse headache), Amitriptyline (no impact) and now Nortriptyline.
I started on 10mg in the morning and 20mg at night. I had to go up to 20mg twice a day to see any effect.
My headaches are now down to about one a week, which I can take pain killers for, so this medication has been amazing for me.
The only downside for me is the extremely dry mouth, but that pales in comparison to the positives. I have also seen that Nortriptyline has lead to weight gain for some. I am fortunate in that it actually keeps hunger at bay.
I have only been on the medication for 8 weeks."
