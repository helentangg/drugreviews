"I have been on Lexapro 10 mg for 1 month. I stopped taking it after that time because the side effects of sleeplessness and restless leg. This nearly made it impossible to perform my work because I was always tired and very often late to work. It seemed to have some benefit in modifying my mood and I was able to keep that up for nearly 6 months before my latest meltdown. I have just tried effexor-xr and stopped them within 5 days because of the side effects of restless leg, barely any sleep at all and an inability to relax most of the time."
