"I was terrified of taking lexapro after having  horrible side effects with every single antidepressant known in the market. I am a 52 year old female and after reading all the negative reviews I quit taking it for a period of 2 weeks. I finally decided I was so miserable I would try it again and 3 monthes later I am doing great! No more fear of leaving house, negative self talk, constant anxiety and worry! I may have gained 1-2 pounds but if you take it you will be more likely to go out for walks, gym and get moving again which I have. Please dont let the negative reviews influence if the med will work for you or not. Im obsessive about weight gain and I am not gaining! Im really liking my new calm self, give it 6 weeks, big difference!"
