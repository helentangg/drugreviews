"I have suffered for years from extreme anxiety, ocd, depression and stress; this has saved my life. I have only taken it for a month but I feel &quot;normal&quot; for the first time in my life. It also has helped me from withdrawing from adderall I was taking for ADHD symptoms, and I can actually focus better now than I could before on the ADD meds."
