"Week1 dizziness, nausea, no appetite, foggy feeling, stomach growling. Week 2  same as before plus sweating, bad GERD,and insomnia. Almost stopped but decided to stick it out. Week 3 everything slowly disappeared. Now on week 4, much calmer, lost weight about 8 lbs, blood pressure dropped to normal readings, I have more energy now I am walking everyday, still feel like myself, not numb like some reported . Reason started was I had 2 deaths in a month and was losing it. In the past I have tried Prozac, lexapro,  effexor, Zoloft and many others nothing has worked as well as celexa. My advice give it time, be patient . Like many things it&#039;s worth waiting for. Good Luck to all!!"
