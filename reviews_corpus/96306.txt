"I am a 17 year old female who has been on Zoloft for almost 6 months. I used to have terrible social anxiety, and was diagnosed with an anxiety and panic disorder. Since I have started taking Zoloft, my ability to speak with people has grown tremendously. I can&#039;t remember ever feeling happier than I do now, and the biggest change in me is the fact that I now feel emotionally stable. I&#039;m only on 25mg, but I have found that it has helped me in incredible ways. The only side effects I have experienced are loss of appetite and slight nausea- I have lost a bit of weight while on this medicine, but not a dangerous amount. I highly recommend talking to your doctor about this medicine if you experience social anxiety, or have panic attacks."
