"Have taken parnate for 5 years. Tried 5-10 other medications before trying parnate. Had bad reaction to most of these - worsening depression and anxiety.Currently taking 80 mgs of parnate, which is above the normal therapeutic range. Have a few side effects that still come and go including daytime fatigue/some tachycardia right after dosing. Take 30 mg in the morning, 20mg in the afternoon, and 30mg in the evening. When started taking it had pretty bad orthostatic hypotension for a week or two. Medicine works well. Depression and anxiety have been kept at bay for 5 years. I can enjoy life. Highly recommended"
