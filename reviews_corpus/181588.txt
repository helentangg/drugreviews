"I started taking Prozac 5 yrs ago due to a panic attacks. I then stopped taking it for 2 months, felt ok for the first 6 weeks apart from withdrawal symptoms. I have now started taking Prozac again as my depression has come back, my panic attacks are getting worse. I feel like can&#039;t leave the house and I cry all the time. I decided that I should try taking them again. "
