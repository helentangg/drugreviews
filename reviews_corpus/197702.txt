"I have had depression for years due to situations that added to it continually.  I have tried every pill made to help.  Usually within 3 days I would take myself off them because of gaining weight within that period of 3 to 5 pounds, also feeling awful to the point of despair.  I had neck surgery that left me with pain everyday to the point of not wanting to live.  My pain management Doctor prescribed Pristiq along with epidural procedures for pain. Within the first day of taking Pristiq I felt a great difference in my mood.  Within 3 days I knew this medicine was totally different.  I have been on it for a month now and the only side effects I&#039;ve had have been minor.  It&#039;s been a great month of feeling more like my old self."
