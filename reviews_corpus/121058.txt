"I originally took effexor 9 years ago at the 75mg dose for anxiety and I ended up in the ER with flushing and brain zaps. But I figured out that not everyone can take 75mg. I opened up the capsule and started with 10mgs . What an amazing medication. I weaned off after a year 1 mg a week for 10 weeks and no side effects.

Now that I am in perimenopause and have IBS and severe irritability and anxiety and feel ill a lot I am back on the effexor 10 mgs a day. This medicine works great but wish doctors realized the pharma companies have no knowledge of how much an individual should start with. 

I will work up to 20 mgs because."
