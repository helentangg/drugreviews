"Began 10mg of Escitalopram, decided I needed to take it at night as it was pretty sedating - which I didn&#039;t mind as my anxiety would keep me awake most nights. I felt great great initially, moved up to 20mg; mood was up, anxiety wasn&#039;t so dwelling, sleeping was great. I work in healthcare and decided to check my BP one day and it was sky high, I&#039;m talking 200/110. Over the weeks, I monitored the blood pressure and symptoms. About a month in, my numbers came down but was still higher than my usual readings. Mood and sleep were still going well. But then I noticed, my husband did first, that I became very fidgety - excessively chewing my finger nails, rambling and
talking with out any meaning. After 6 weeks of use, my doctor decided to take me off."
