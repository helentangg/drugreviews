"I am so hopeful about this medication. Within 24 hours, I could tell a world of difference in my outlook (I have suffered with major depression most of my life). I have been on Pristiq 2 weeks now. I did miss a dose 2 days ago and could tell the difference in my focus, concentration and mood (yesterday and today), so I will definitely be faithful about taking it from now on.

I am feeling the overwhelming tiredness after an initial burst of energy when I first started taking it. I hope that will get better. And I do think it has helped me focus on other things besides food."
