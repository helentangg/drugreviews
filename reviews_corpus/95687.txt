"This medication is great for depression, however, I am not really feeling much change in Social Phobia - except for preventing blushing, but not in all situations. I have been on it for 5 1/2 weeks so I am still giving it time. The side effects are easily coped with, and it didn&#039;t escalate my anxiety to begin with, although it made me very drowsy."
