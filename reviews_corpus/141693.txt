"I&#039;m a 30 yr old female. Recently I got promoted at work to a more stressful and pressured role, I also found out that my partner of 12yrs has been having an affair. I&#039;ve turned to therapy and Lexapro to help me through this time. I&#039;ve only been on it for a week and have already experienced an improvement. I started with 5mg, will move up to 10mg in a week. My issues were-social anxiety and mild depression, I&#039;d say my anxiety has decreased by 60%, psych said that I takes 3-6weeks for it to really kick in, so can&#039;t wait. The worst part for me was my doctor started me off on 20mg and for 2 days I had extreme anxiety and moderate depression, but I read through some positive posts and decided to soldier on with it and am so happy that I did."
