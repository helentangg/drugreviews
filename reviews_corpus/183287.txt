"I had been abusing Vicodin for 10 years!  Stopped and it threw me into an AWFUL depression. My doctor put me on 60mg of Cymbalta.  It took me a full month BUT the change was nothing less then AMAZING. It was as if a light went off and BAM I woke up one day and was ME again. For me this was a life saver medication. Been on this medicine for 42 days now."
