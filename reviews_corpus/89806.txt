"I&#039;ve been taking Celexa 20mg for almost six months, and it has helped me with my social anxiety. It&#039;s a lot easier to use the strategies that my psychologist talks about. However, a warning must be given. Celexa has not been a &#039;magic bullet&#039;. I still have to do a lot of work to not be anxious. However, it has helped me so much that I can&#039;t think about quitting any time soon."
