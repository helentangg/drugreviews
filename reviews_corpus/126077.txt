"I have been off and on antidepressants the last 10 years and Wellbutrin did a great job after my son died. But I had terrible eye twitches and then bounced around to all the usual medicine. Viibyrd is amazing. I had some diarrhea issues, no restless legs or weird dreams but with the OxyContin and hydrocodone I don&#039;t ever have issues sleeping really. And Xanax for my anxiety I feel really sharp again focused on life not worried about what I can and can&#039;t do since my spinal injury. Life&#039;s good! Oh and the sex has been amazing! I would recommend this to anyone."
