"When I started to experience extreme anxiety, panic disorder, and depression last spring at 20 years old, I didn&#039;t know what I was feeling. I help hopeless and often questioned the purpose of life. I couldn&#039;t explain why I felt this way, but I know it wasn&#039;t me. It came out of NO WHERE. I vowed to myself that if I could get through this, I would help others in their journey to get through it as well. It will be a year since I started escitalopram and I can truly say it saved my life and has made me a much happier and appreciative person. You never know know much you take everyday happiness and serenity for granted until you mind is never at rest. If you are struggling, please give this medication a chance and don&#039;t be afraid to get help."
