"I&#039;ve only been on sertraline for just over a week and I&#039;ve noticed a massive difference already,  I&#039;ve been suffering with major PMT and depression for a long time but after trying a number of antidepressants and each one making me feel so ill to continue taking them I&#039;ve stopped and tried just buying herbal tablets but they don&#039;t really do alot so after feeling so ill and nearly losing everything I went back to the doctors and was put in these, I was told to take 50mg once a day but after taking them for the first 2 days I felt absolutely awful so I just take half a tablet  each night, I feel a million times better already, it&#039;s my 10th day now and I and my husband and children can see a huge difference in my mood already ."
