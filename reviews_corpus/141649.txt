"Lexapro has changed my life and the lives of my family.  I struggled with tremors, nausea, dizziness, chest pains, numbness and tingling in my hands and feet, and muscle twitching.  I thought I was dying.  After a million medical tests that were all normal, my doctor diagnosed me with anxiety.  I did not believe him.  I was started on Lexapro, and felt better in a matter of weeks.  I cannot adequately express my joy and relief.  I do not wish to fall into my bed all day anymore.  I am able to enjoy my amazing husband and children again.  I am posting to give hope to anyone who is experiencing anything like I was.  Anxiety caused me awful physical symptoms that  lasted all day for months.  There is light at the end of the tunnel."
