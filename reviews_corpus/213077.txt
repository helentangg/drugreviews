"I tried many medications and many combinations with little or no effect.  As a last effort, I turned to the internet and stumbled across some positive info about Nardil.  It took awhile to even find a doctor that would prescribe it.  I have now been on 90 mgs for around four or five years and it works very well with few unwanted side effects.  I take it in combination with 20mgs of Zyprexa for a very severe form of generalized anxiety that I have."
