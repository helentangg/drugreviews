"Lexapro has saved my life. I have been on it for one month and I have gone from a severely depressed recluse full of anger, rage and self hate, not wanting to see or hear from anyone ever. I am back at work, socialising, eating normally, playing sport and am about to book an overseas holiday. I felt some positive effects after two weeks and felt good after one month. Depression and social anxiety has definitely improved. I don&#039;t have any constant racing negative thoughts anymore, these disappeared after about a week and a half. I had very minor side effects but it was nothing that wasn&#039;t manageable, a few minor headaches and feeling spacey for the first week. I take 10mg at night because it makes me feel tired and I have a great sleep."
