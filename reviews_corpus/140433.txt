"I&#039;m on lexapro 3 weeks now. I use to wake up every morning angry, argue with everyone, not talk to anyneo and generally be an introvert.The waking up angry has stopped, I crave being around people now.  I started these for 2 weeks before, came off then then went back on them due to stress and arguing with my boyfriend. I&#039;m interested in applying for jobs and getting my drive back so I&#039;ll see after 2 months.N o weight gain and all my negative thinking is gone"
