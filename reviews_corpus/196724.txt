"Really helps my PMDD and my stress/anxiety. I was very thin from stress before I started on Paxil. I have rapidly gained weight since taking this medication. I have also become emotionless. As much as I dislike it, at least I don&#039;t feel anger, stress and anxiety anymore. Clearly I&#039;m taking the good with the bad."
