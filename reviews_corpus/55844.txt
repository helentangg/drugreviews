"I&#039;ve been on Effexor for approximately two years.  I recently had the extremely unpleasant side effects from coming off the drug, as I could not get a refill on my prescription for 6 days.  I ended up in the ER due to a panic attack (never had one in my life before).  It did reveal, however, that the medicine was not really working for me, as my pain level was virtually the same whether I was on it or not.  Please make sure you gradually go off this medicine under the care of a Dr."
