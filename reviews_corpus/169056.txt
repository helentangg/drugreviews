"I have taken just about everything on the market, with 1 week of starting Viibryd, my life was completely changed.  The best 30 days of my life, then I went from the sample pack to the prescription and it has been down hill for almost 60 days.  I have put on almost 15 lbs, the worst night terrors of my life, my sex drive in the 1st 30 days was through the roof, now nothing.  I cannot sleep, my anxiety was back and I became suicidal.  I have been off of Viibryd for 6 days, the withdrawals are rough and this is even after the step down process.  I was hoping that this would continue to be the best medication ever, but not for me.  "
