"Been on clomipramine for 25 years for OCD.  Brilliant but gave me the shakes!  Stopped dispensing in UK couple of years ago.  GP put me on Prozac...ok for depression but not for OCD.  On Sertraline for 2 years.  Great but feel disconnected to myself.  Numb that&#039;s what I feel.    No ups or downs just numb.  Haven&#039;t even cried when my mum died.  But at least I&#039;m alive."
