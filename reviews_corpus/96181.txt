"Started sertraline at 25mg and have slowly increased to 200mg daily over a period of 9 months. My depression is totally gone, but have continued to battle general anxiety and a little social anxiety.  Just increased to 200 mg this week and have my fingers crossed!  I also take 1 mg Klonopin daily. I&#039;m a 55 year old female and as I look back over my life, I can see that I&#039;ve always had anxiety issues. Zoloft has been a tremendous help for me!"
