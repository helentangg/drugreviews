"I have been on phenelzine since it first came out in the early 60&#039;s and although I have tried many other things, phenelzine has always worked for me.

I also have high blood pressure so phenelzine was thought not to be a good choice, however it stabilized my blood pressure that I have now been able to stop taking medication to control it.

It is an old fashioned medicine, there are dietary restrictions but you get used to them. Just as diabetics get used to their dietary restrictions and it is a very small price to pay for peace of mind. I trained SRN/RMN, have a degree on IT and live a very full and active life as I approach my 70th birthday."
