"Coming up to the 1 year mark, been on 20mg per day until this week when I&#039;ve increased to 30mg. Until last few weeks my anxiety has been manageable but now I feel it returning due to some personal issues at home.
Compared to how I was this time last year just before I started I am ten times better, but am by no means cured. I&#039;ve increased my dosage with doctors guidance in order to continue managing my anxiety and depression.I find this medication great in most ways but the side effects are not good. I had severe nausea for the first 3 weeks, night tremors, hot sweats, no appetite. Within 4 weeks these had all gone completely but I&#039;ve found that I suffer with terrible short term memory, increased hair loss and alcohol affects me much worse."
