"I was on Paxil....in hopes of trying to find a drug perhaps more effective my doctor put me on Viibryd.  I was weaned off of Paxil in 3 weeks, and put on Viibryd.  After 3 weeks on the drug, I started having the absolute worst panic attacks of my life.  My poop turned green, and I had sleep paralysis!!! NO DRUG should EVER do that to a  person...I weaned off this poison and I am through with psychiatrists.  I do not recommend this drug to anyone!  I was in complete misery for months and took my body a while to get back to where it was."
