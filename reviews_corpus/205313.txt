"Anyone who appreciates their physical health as much as their mental health I&#039;m warning/begging you not to take Pristiq. It&#039;s intolerable in every way. I&#039;ve been on it 4 weeks and 2 days. NO POSITIVE BENEFITS! However I have experienced the following from Pristiq: severe nausea, vomiting, nightmares, night sweats, headaches and migraines, brain zaps, loss of concentration , blurred vision....
If I can help only one person to not put this horrid dug into their body this comment will be worth it. 
Please, do yourself a favor, ther are other drugs out there. I regret every single day on Pristiq. I feel even more depressed than when I began."
