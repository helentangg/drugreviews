"I tried Pristiq, which had been listed on my Genesight review in the positive column. Was on it for three weeks and had to stop as I had developed hypermania: no sleep, talkative, spending, messy, walking around confused and generally felt very high. Felt very unsafe driving and was also eating everything in sight until I had a stomach ache. Gained weight and just felt plain bloated. While I recognized that something was wrong, I was not thinking straight enough too judge. Fortunately, the prescriber recognized it and I am now stopped 3 days. Don&#039;t feel great, but I am glad I was not on it  long enough to have withdrawal problems."
