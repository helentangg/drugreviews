"Could not live without it. Minimal side effects and helps keep my moods level. Without it i would bite your head off just for speaking to me. it is a horrible feeling to not be able to control your emotions, no matter how hard u try. Citalopram has changed my life. Worst side effect is sexual lethargy, no desire but being single, i can deal with that for now."
