"I&#039;ve only been taking this for four days now, (for depression and anxiety) so way to early to tell, but I wanted to get in right at the start.
I&#039;m on 20 mg, and after four days I&#039;m feeling quite nauseous.  I only sleep for a couple of hours at night, then I wake up with my mind racing with random negative thoughts, though this has seemed a bit easier the last couple of nights
I&#039;ll post notes weekly to let you no my experience."
