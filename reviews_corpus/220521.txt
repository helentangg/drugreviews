"Hello, I would like to share my positive experience of taking Amytriptyline as it has truly helped save my life. I was prescribed this for acute and chronic pains in my legs which were also affecting my sleep. The pain was like searing stabbing pain. I was also suicidal.
I was started on amitriptyline 10mg and was also told it would help with my other myriad of symptoms - Irritable Bowel Syndrome, weak bladder, insomnia, anxiety, etc.  At first, it caused numbness in my fingers and toes and on waking and going to the bathroom I had dizzy spells, my vision was a bit weird.  The doctor told me to half my dose to 5mg and although it took a few months, I gradually started to feel better and all of my symptoms improved. I hope to gradually take less so I am not dependent forever."
