"Viibryd has been great for me as far as taking care of my depression.  It started acting quickly and has been fantastic!  I have nothing but good to say about how well it treats my depression.

However, if I EVER miss my pills at night I am in REALLY bad shape the next morning.  I am extremely tired - but in a really weird way.  I am super sensitive to light - to the point it is dangerous for me to drive as the sun comes up because I can&#039;t keep my eyes open.  When I take a nap (because I am so tired) I have horrific nightmares that are really vivid.  It really is kind of scary. "
