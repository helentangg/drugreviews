"Started taking it for depression, (150mg) but have had IBS with diarrhea and cramping pain starting about 10 years ago. Taking immodium/loperamide at least every other day kept it under control since then, but after going on nortriptyline I&#039;ve noticed it&#039;s improved this to where I only need to take immodium like once a week now to be completely symptom free."
