"I&#039;ve been taking 20 mg Paxil for about 11 years now for anxiety, and though it makes me calmer it has several side effects that I don&#039;t like.  1. Decreased libido/decreased orgasm  2.  Constipation  3.  Decreased energy.   A friend of mine also told me I seem more &quot;delayed&quot; after I&#039;ve been taking it regularly. Sometimes I take half a pill or skip days when I feel I need to get more things done, or I want my boyfriend to be happy.  But I notice if I skip it for more than 3 days in a row I feel &quot;crazy&quot; and hyper and scattered.  I definitely get more irritable when I&#039;m not on it, but I &quot;feel&quot; more emotionally and notice I dance more often in the kitchen with my daughter when not under Paxil&#039;s control."
