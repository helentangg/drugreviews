"I just started taking Zoloft. I am a 16 year old male suffering from severe social anxiety. I was never like this before a of couple months ago. Anyway I started taking it about 5 days ago. At first my anxiety got worse. But today I didn&#039;t feel all that bad and just hoping it gets better from here. We will see. Also only side effects. Slight headache here and there."
