"I started taking Effexor about a year ago.  It has made an incredible difference to my life.  I was extremely anxious, waking at night in a sweat (possible also the onset of menopause) and struggling to go back to sleep.  I was also depressed and found myself often crying for no reason at all.  I started very slowly, increasing dose every 2 months.  I cannot recommend Effexor enough.  I feel that it has turned my life around.  I did not gain weight at all which was a big concern.  I did feel quite lethargic at first and it took a while to get any sex drive back.  I am still not back to my usual sex drive, and reaching orgasm is harder. I still feel my decision to stay on Effexor has been the right one. Hope this helps.  Good luck."
