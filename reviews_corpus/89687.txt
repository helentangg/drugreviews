"Works very well for me. Obsessive thoughts occur very infrequently and when they do occur I am able to brush it off as the drug has reduced my anxiety.  My side effects of drowsiness lasted about one to two weeks.  I also find that the mineral magnesium is also helpful.  Daily exercise is also part of my treatment and is great for reducing stress and anxiety as well as burning off excess adrenaline."
