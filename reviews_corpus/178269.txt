"I take 60 mg of Cymbalta for depression for the last 5 years and I&#039;ve felt a noticeable difference in my mood (depression lifted). I used to cry all the time for any little thing, and now my emotions are in check, no more cry baby! There are a few side effects, including out-of-nowhere jerking. It doesn&#039;t happen much, but when it does, it&#039;s weird! This is a medicine you cannot miss. I have inadvertently missed a dose and was back to the weepies, to the sadness. Before I tried Cymbalta, I had tried many, many other antidepressants and they never had ANY effect on my depression. THEN THERE WAS CYMBALTA. Thank goodness for this medicine. I can&#039;t imagine my life without it. What a blessing."
