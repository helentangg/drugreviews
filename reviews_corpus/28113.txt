"So far, so good! I started on 10mg daily, then after a week, my dosage was increased to 20mg daily.  I have been on this stuff for just under a month now, and I am starting to feel a bit better already.  Other people have also noticed and a few have commented that I seem perkier and more alive.  I have taken several different types of SSRI/SNRI antidepressants in the past and for me, this one is the best in terms of effectiveness and for side effects.  I do get the weird, psychedelic dreams every night and wake up really groggy, I get a bit constipated and I can&#039;t stop yawning all day.  Also, its difficult to orgasm. But, its still better than constantly wanting to die. I almost feel like going back to work......almost!"
