"Zoloft has helped me so much so far. I have spent the last three months getting worse and worse. Panic, anxiety and depression. I was on Wellbutrine but it just seemed to make me worse. 
Two days after starting Zoloft (I take it before I go to bed), I woke up happy. I felt normal - like myself! I don&#039;t know about the sexual side effects yet because frankly it was difficult to want to be intimate when I was living in an emotional hell. 
Thank you Zoloft!! "
