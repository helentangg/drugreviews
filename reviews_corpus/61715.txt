"I have had feelings of moodiness, irritability, snappiness, and slight depression since my children were born. I cast it aside, for FOUR YEARS, thinking I was just nuts and hormonal. After talking to my OB/Gyn about these issues on multiple visits, she suggested I try celexa.

I have been on 10mg for one week. The first two days were the worst: headache, nauseated, and diarrhea. I&#039;ve also been slightly tired, and have had a bit of insomnia. 

However, I&#039;ve caught myself SMILING all of the time. My chest no longer fees tight. I&#039;m enjoying and embracing motherhood, and feel moments of euphoria. I&#039;m hoping my body adjusts accordingly to the medication within the next few months."
