"My life from the verge of collapse as the medication a previous doctor had me on for over two years made me want to sleep all day not get out of bed terrible mood swings and if I did not take the clorazipam as did not want to feel sleepy I would have severe side effects.  With my new doctor I have been on this medicine for just over a month and I cannot tell you how it has transformed my life rescued my marriage and being able to deal with my children again.  Thank you escitalopram for saving my life."
