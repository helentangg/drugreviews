"My 16 year old daughter began this medication in October and it has been a blessing for her overwhelming anxiety. She is now able to function normally. She has joined swim team at her high school and began taking piano lessons. She is getting out and spending time with her old friends and making new ones. Prior to the medication she was so anxious that she could not speak in class or raise her voice above a whisper outside of our home. The anxiety she experienced prior to the Sertraline was completely debilitating.  She is getting talk therapy, exercising regularly and eating a balanced diet along with taking the medication. I was initially very opposed to &quot;drugs.&quot; Now I feel I denied my child nessessary medication. Don&#039;t be afraid to try it!"
