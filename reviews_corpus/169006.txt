"After having been on Lexapro (tired all the time and nearly emotionless, libido killer), Zoloft (gained 30 lbs in 3 months, libido killer), Effexor (ineffective and made my head sweat, libido killer), Paxil (zombie, libido inhibitor), Wellbutrin (allergic), I was afraid Viibryd would be more of the same. I&#039;ve been on it for about 6 or 7 months and I had no side effects other than mild nausea about an hour after taking it, but it went away fairly quickly. My libido is back to normal and I still have emotions, which is great. I was on 20 mg but I started to feel the hopeless despair and irritability break through so my Dr bumped me up to 30 mg (I take one and a half 20 mg tabs) three or four weeks ago. The adjustment is taking time."
