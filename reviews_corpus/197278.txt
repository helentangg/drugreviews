"I have been taking 30 mg of Paxil daily for about 4 years. It truly changed my life. I have had more issues with anxiety than depression, I couldn&#039;t sleep, I was angry all the time for no reason, I had constant pressure on my chest- Paxil put an end to the sleepless nights, nipped the depression in the bud and took my anxiety level down by about 90%. The only problems are if I miss a pill I get those nasty electric shock feelings, I feel like my emotions are almost a bit too subdued (can&#039;t cry, sometimes you got to pet or out) and lastly I have NO sex drive. For this reason I&#039;m in the process of tapering off and my doctor is putting me on Viibryd. But if that doesn&#039;t work as well as Paxil I&#039;ll definitely switch back!"
