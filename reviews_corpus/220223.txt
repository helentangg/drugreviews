"This really has changed my life! I suffered a whole year thinking my urethral stricture was the cause, after that was sorted I still carried on with what felt like constant cystitis. My urologist finally diagnosed Interstitial Cystitis and started me on 20mg of amitriptyline. After 10-14days it worked! Have the very odd day of mild discomfort but it&#039;s changed my life. I haven&#039;t noticed side effects as yet, on my 9th week on them."
