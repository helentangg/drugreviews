"I have been on Zoloft for about one year. Was on 25mg, I recently increased the dosage to 50mg, to help get through a stressful time. It has definitely worked for me. This increase though I am noticing more dry mouth and stomach upset decreased appetite. I have had really bad anxiety about social situations and sleep (not getting enough) I hated going places or being around people. This medication has helped me greatly. I&#039;m hoping it will continue to do so on 50 mg, and I hope to step back down so I do not get the burnout effect that so many people talk about."
