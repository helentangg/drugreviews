"I use this medication for more than depression, especially since I&#039;m diagnosed with other mental illnesses such as bipolar and body dystrophic disorder (many more). But the medication does in fact help, I have been on it for a year now(I&#039;m 15) since prosaic hasn&#039;t helped. Although medication is meant to help you, it can&#039;t solve your problems, but it can give you the power to be able to solve them yourself"
