"Used to read these over and over when I contemplating &quot;obsessing&quot; over whether or not to take the medication.  Prozac has given me my life back.  Life is no longer a struggle just to enjoy. It is not a miracle drug, you still have to put in the work, therapy really helps.  But at times when I feel a wave of anxiety come over me that used to last 3-4 days/sleepless nights, I can almost feel the medication working.  And next thing I know I&#039;m 100 steps down the road from that worry.  Some side effects in beginning with up dosing such as headaches and not getting full nights sleep but all have passed and I can only say the only side effect is I feel so good I forgot to take my Prozac.  Get your life back and just try it!"
