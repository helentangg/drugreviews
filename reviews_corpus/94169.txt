"Hey. Started taking Brintellix six weeks ago. I have been on Lexapro for ages and wanted to try something else as I thought Lexapro was flattening it on its effectiveness. Brintellix has me so anxious it&#039;s incredible and I seem to want to cry all the time.
Cognitively, heaps of improvement, helped with energy as well. But has done nothing for GAD, which is the root cause of my issues. This has been disastrous and cost me my job because of anxiety build up and subsequently the depression that&#039;s followed.
Good luck to you all on this medication... Each to their own I guess. It&#039;s just plain horrible for me!"
