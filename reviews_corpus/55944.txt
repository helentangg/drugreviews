"I had suffered from extreme anxiety and depression for a few years and countless prescribed anti-depressants prior to trying Effexor. I suffered anxiety so bad that it was hard to do daily tasks such as driving and going to the grocery store. I went through countless jobs because a panic attack would strike at work and I would have to rush out of the situation and never return because the fear of it happening again would haunt me. The very first day being on Effexor, I felt like a different person. For the first time in years, I wanted to venture out into the world and be around people. After a week of being on 75 mg, I landed a job and now, two years later I am still symptom free and off the medicines. I give this medicine a big 10!"
