"I am 46 and have suffered from depression since I was a teenager and fibromyalgia pain and stiffness since I was 30.  Nothing else helped much. I tried gabapentin, Prozac, and other anti-depressants.  Ibuprofen and tramadol helped a little with the pain but not like Cymbalta! I started on 30mg and worked up to 90mg daily. I feel like I am cured!  No more morning pain and stiffness, no more aches and pain and my mood is so much brighter! I haven&#039;t felt this happy since I was a kid. I am laughing all the time. I can do things that I haven&#039;t been able to do physically for years. I started jogging.  Side effects have been a loss of appetite, insomnia, and hot flashes but well worth it!"
