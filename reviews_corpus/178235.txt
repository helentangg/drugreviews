"Cymbalta has been very effective for me. I was prescribed a different antidepressant that soon proved ineffective for my depression.  I take 60 mg Cymbalta per day and have not suffered any side effects accept lack of libido.  I have found ways to lessen those effects.  Before this drug, I really thought I was losing my mind and I could not function on a daily basis.  I never understood depression but I do now. This medicine has been a blessing for me."
