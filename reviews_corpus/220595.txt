"I have really, really bad insomnia. I&#039;m up for 3 -4 days straight and after my doctor prescribed me a combination of zopiclone and amitriptyline I&#039;m able to sleep 4-5 hours but your body can become tolerant after a while meaning you may have to increase your dosage. I&#039;ve had to do this but what I&#039;ve started to do is try to keep really busy throughout the day and IF needed at night I&#039;ll take a smaller dose than prescribed to me or try to go a few days without it then take my regular dose.
