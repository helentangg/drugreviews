"I have been taking Cymbalta for two years now- it honestly changed my life. At the time I started taking it I was a college athlete and anxiety ruled my life. At first, I would take it during the morning hours and I would immediately want to go to bed. That was my problem, I needed to take it about an hour or two before bed. I am still experimenting the exact right time to take it (I sometimes wake up still feeling tired from it- but not sure if it&#039;s the medication or my routine now). I know certain medications work for some and not others, but I would recommend this medication. I had slight symptoms at first beside the tiredness- decreased appetite and no sexual desires or emotions. I still feel great! (30mg once daily)"
