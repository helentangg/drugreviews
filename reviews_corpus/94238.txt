"I am an R.N. and diagnosed 20 plus years ago with clinical depression, I have also been on just about every antidepressant.  A week ago I requested help from my physician due to the increasing depression and lack of help from Cymbalta he prescribed Brintellix.  I switched immediately and some of the symptoms are withdrawal from the Cymbalta.  The &quot; reverberations&quot; in my head are distinctly withdrawal symptoms.  My headaches appear to be from decreased sodium which is a Brintellix side effect and for me are eliminated by drinking Gatorade which is high in sodium.  The nausea is a toss up and eased with ginger ale and carbs.  The itching responds to 1 Benadryl.  4 weeks is the norm for side effects to subside.  Identical to original Prozac."
