"My story; I hope it gives strength &amp; even though you feel like shit now with the RIGHT TREATMENT &amp; DOSE YOU WILL GET BETTER. In a nutshell; abusive relationship, court case &amp; bullying at work which resulted in me resigning. Venlafaxine given for 9 months but felt like a zombie/emotionless. My &quot;genious&quot; GP thought it would be good for me to stop immediately. NEVER DO THIS - TAPER OVER A MONTH as I got discontinuation syndrome. I fell into a deep depression &amp; felt mentally unstable reporting to A&amp;E twice. I was terrified &amp; spent weeks just lying on the floor to stop me topping myself (totally out of character). Sertraline saved me when the right dose was found. Try mindfulness to help with the tough times. YOU WILL RECOVER."
