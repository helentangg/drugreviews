"I have been on Pristiq for 3 weeks and it is wonderful! The only side effect I have suffered is nausea, but well well worth it! I was on low dose of Wellbutrin for almost a year and started suffering severe depression, my husband and 3 kids were definitely suffering from this as I was! I am very thankful for Pristiq, just wish it wasn&#039;t so expensive.  I am only having to take 50mg once a day and hope to be able to get off completely soon.  There is hope!"
