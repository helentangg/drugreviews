"I was in a really bad spot with the constant anxiety and panic attacks.  It was affecting every aspect of my life negatively.  At first I slept a lot, which wasn&#039;t necessarily bad since I hadn&#039;t been sleeping anyway.  Sex was a little off, but at least I feel a lot better and don&#039;t feel like I could jump out of my skin 24 hours a day.  I hate that I have to take something, but it&#039;s much better than the alternative!"
