"I remember looking at this website 5 or so months ago trying to find reviews on Zoloft and I must admit it scared me to even try it. I have been struggling with anxiety/panic disorder since the age of 13. (I am now 19) It would come and go, I would be good for a few months and then have a month of extreme anxiety. I have tried almost every medication out there from Celxa, Paxil, Lexapro, Abilify and many more. All of them made me feel emotionless. Yeah, the anxiety was gone but so was all my other emotions. I went a year without any medication only to hit rock bottom. I couldn&#039;t leave the house, I quit my job, and overall lost my passion for life! Zoloft changed that, it truely saved my life! I HIGHLY recommend Zoloft!"
