"I have had panic disorder since I was about 6. It came and went and has caused me severe avoidance issues throughout my life.  I have been taking Paxil for about 8 years and it has worked wonders. It has been awesome...until recently.  Within the last 4 months, it just seems to have quit working well. I am having severe attacks from time to time, but I am starting to avoid things/situations.  It did make me gain about 30 pounds. I tend to clench my jaws and I startle easily, but those are the only side effect I notice. My family and close friends say I am much more of a pleasure to be around while I am on it.  I am not a mean person nor have anger issues, but I am just not so anxious and uptight."
