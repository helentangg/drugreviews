"I took one dose of 30 mg for bad ongoing fibromyalgia pain.  It kept me awake and I felt nauseous most of the day BUT It took most of my pain away!  It was miraculous really.  I debated continuing because who wants to trade those side affects for pain and I hate taking drugs.  I decided to see how long this no-pain would last without taking another pill and it&#039;s been almost a week and I&#039;m still good.  I decided to try the oil CBD&#039;s (I live in Colorado) at night and so far, all is excellent.  I&#039;m hoping it continues.  I think taking one triggered the pain mechanism to stop and am so glad NOT to have to take that horrible drug."
