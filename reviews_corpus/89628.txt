"I mainly wanted to talk about withdrawal from this medication. It does work very well for depression. I honestly felt a lot better after being depressed for 4 or 5 years before I sought treatment. Just a warning to those who are considering stopping the medication...please consult your doctor and do it gradually. I stopped taking it and at the end of a 7 day period I felt like I was having a heart attack. My chest wouldn&#039;t stop hurting and I felt nauseous and dizzy. "
