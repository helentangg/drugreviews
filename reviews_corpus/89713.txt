"This medicine is not for me. I only took it for three nights and I started throwing up, seeing things that were not there. I have a huge headache, felt like I was hit by a truck. Have been getting cold sweats and just felt like I was going to die. My heart rate jumped up to 175 and I normally run at 86ish. I have not been able to eat and I sleep but not like I used to. I am asleep but I hear everything. This medicine is not for me. I hope other people have better luck.."
