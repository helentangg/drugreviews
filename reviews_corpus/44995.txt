"I was diagnosed 5 years ago with General anxiety disorder and panic disorder with mild agoraphobia. For the first few months I had no idea what was going on with me except that I knew I would get completely flustered and anxious and scared when I went out to do everyday things. I began worrying all the time about silly things and couldn&#039;t seem to shut my mind off enough to sleep and relax. My doctor diagnosed me and for a while I tried seeing just a therapist but eventually my panic attacks came back stronger and I decided on medication. I have tried three other medications all of which were not successful. I am 8 days in on Prozac and the side effects have been pretty bad but I have hope. Today was much calmer for me."
