"I am taking Zoloft for social anxiety, depression, OCD (27yo F). I have to start out by saying I had TERRIBLE side effects for the 1.5months (nausea, dizziness, migraines, panic attack) to the point where I almost stopped taking the tablet.

I persisted and 7 months on Zoloft has completely changed my life. I have had depression and OCD for years and anxiety had started to take over my life.
After the initial symptoms subsided, I feel like a better, confident and much happier version of former myself. Like many others it&#039;s hard to explain what I mean. It&#039;s the best thing I&#039;ve ever done!
Please try to persist!"
