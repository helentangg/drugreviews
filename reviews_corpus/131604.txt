"I&#039;ve been on Effexor for about 2 years. It&#039;s changed my life completely. Before I went to rehab and before I was on it, I couldn&#039;t get out of bed for days at a time. It gives me energy and motivation! However, the withdrawal symptoms are horrific. If I miss a dose, I get severe headaches. I feel like there are fireworks going off in my head. Last year, I had to go the ER because I couldn&#039;t breathe or stop shaking after 3 weeks of cutting it cold turkey (due to an insurance error). This is definitely not the drug for people who regularly miss doses or have problems with addiction pills. It&#039;s not for everyone, but works great for me."
