"This drug (20 mg) works for me to a certain degree.  I&#039;m still depressed at sporatic times and sometimes almost suicidal (But less so than I was before).  I&#039;m also taking it for anxiety, but I also take Klonopin (1 mg).  The anxiety I had for 15 years has subsided considerably, but the depression still persists. I do have strange side effects on this drug, like extreme restlessness (especially at night), and I sometimes feel like screaming- which never happened to me before.  My family says I act strangely, and I must try to control my idiosyncrasies.  My strange behavior only happens on some days.  Maybe it isn&#039;t the right drug for me.  It has helped though- even if the side effects are annoying."
