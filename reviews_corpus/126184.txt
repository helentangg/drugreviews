"I have only just begun taking Viibryd, and after one pill I already notice a difference, love it, My doctor has always directed me to take my anti-depressants at night for one of the biggest side effects is drowsiness. I did have a little bit of a hard time falling asleep, I was taking 200mg Zoloft for about 2 yrs and it just pooped out. I haven&#039;t had any side effects yet. I&#039;m very hopeful of this antidepressant. Although I did have one side effect my  muscles feel like I ran a country mile. I&#039;m hoping this gets better as I adjust to taking higher doses."
