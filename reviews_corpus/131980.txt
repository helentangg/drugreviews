"I was on the lowest dose of Effexor XR and loved how I felt -- it just took the edge off of everything and made me less irritable and more easygoing.  What I didn&#039;t like is the 40lb weight gain and increased blood pressure that came with it.  My blood pressure went back to normal when I quit taking it, but getting the weight off is a real struggle.  I&#039;m doing Weight Watchers AND working with a trainer twice a week (plus doing cardio on other days) and the weight is coming off slowly.  Before Effexor, I could easily drop 10lbs doing Weight Watchers only.  So, yeah, I think it killed my metabolism.  Although I really liked how I felt and functioned, I wouldn&#039;t have taken it if I&#039;d known about the [seemingly permanent] weight gain."
