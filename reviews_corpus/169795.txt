"I have been sick with cyclical vomiting disease for about 10 years, loosing 10 pounds about every 8 or 9 months and being nauseous from 1 week to 1 month at a time. Since i&#039;ve been on amitriptyline I have not been sick any more. I do eat more and have gained weight but not being nauseous anymore is wonderful. I actually was considered anorexic for a while because I was so skinny and couldn&#039;t eat. Thank you doctors."
