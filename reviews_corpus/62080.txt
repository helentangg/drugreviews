"Have been taking this for 2 weeks, and the positive effects were immediate for me.  I did have some initial side effects such as dry mouth (lasted a few days), and change in bowel movement (getting better ), yawning a lot first 3-5 days, better now.  The impact it has had on me has been nothing but GREAT.  I had a lot of areas of stress in my life from family to work, and the anxiety made me feel my heart was going to jump out of my chest!  Now, those little things don&#039;t worry me, and I&#039;ve been able to let go of personal struggles that were holding me down, including a broken heart!   This has let me be myself again, and most of all to enjoy life again!!"
