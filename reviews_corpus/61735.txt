"Celexa was prescribed for my Mom (83). She had horrible side effects. Shaking hands, tight shoulders/muscles, lack of appetite, nausea, tiredness and trouble sleeping. She has switched to Prozac but is having side effects from discontinuing it. Extreme agitation and weepiness. She enjoys knitting and reading and could not do either with the shaking in her hands."
