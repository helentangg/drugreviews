"I had my first anxiety attack when my oldest son was 2 years old &amp; ended up in the ER. My doctor prescribed Paxil &amp; it really helped. I&#039;ve been on it for about 16 years now..even took it when I was pregnant with my second child. The only side effect I&#039;ve really had is weight gain."
