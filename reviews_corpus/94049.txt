"I started out on 5mg and was okay. Was a little nausea at first...but needed to increase my dose due to the seasons. When I got put on 10mg.... the vomiting and sickness really kicked in. Almost every time I take it.... I vomit 10 minutes later. I&#039;m also way more tired than I ever have been. I feel emotionless, and like I could sleep all day everyday. My mind feels Ike I can&#039;t think sometimes. The 5mg never did any of this. All this started when I increased my dose."
