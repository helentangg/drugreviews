"My practitioner was not allowed by the HMO to diagnose or treat fibromyalgia. She had to wait until my pain, fatigue and brain fog threatened my job and stressed me to the point of flunking the mental health quiz they give us. After the initial side effects, which I decribe as &quot;itchy blood&quot;, I was more mobile and clear-headed, sleeping and waking on a normal schedule. I&#039;ve never done that before. The withdrawals are weird, so I keep the old bottle handy from when I switched to time-release. I didn&#039;t realize how much pain I had been trying to cope with until the first time I ran out."
