"I have been taking Citalopram for over a year now for my anxiety which was caused by life stresses. I would go from 1-100 in a matter of seconds for the littlest things that would just get me so angry.  After taking Citalopram it has greatly improved my life and my moods. The only downfall is that although I do not have a loss of appetite for sex but it is very difficult to achieve orgasm on this medication. Otherwise it is very helpful for me."
