"I&#039;ve been on Zoloft for almost a year now. I will be changing medicines in 4 days, which makes me really anxious. This drug worked well for my depression and anxiety. However, I&#039;ve been completely unable to have a good time while on this medication. I can&#039;t bring myself to go out, hang out with friends. I do nothing. I have no motivation. The biggest problem I&#039;ve had with Zoloft is extreme weight gain. I&#039;ve gained 50 lbs in the year. "
