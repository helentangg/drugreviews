"I was diagnosed with anxiety and severe ocd. I have been on Zoloft for 3 weeks and am starting to see a difference . I&#039;m back doing things I used to do before my anxiety . I started on 50 mg and now am up to 150. Makes me tired though and need to take afternoon naps. All together im happy I made the decision to go on medication . It&#039;s starting to change my life for the better."
