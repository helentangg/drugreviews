"I have taken paxil since 1995 after having a nervous breakdown.  I also weaned myself off of paxil for 13 months in 2000 so that I could get pregnant.  In 2001 I experienced post postpartum depression with no anxiety and went back on the paxil.  Paxil is best suited for patients with Anxiety and MDD. It is a very potent SSRI. On dealing with the side effects:  Weight gain can be prevented with proactive exercise.  Constipation can be prevented by diet, suppository etc  Sexual side effects can be reduced by reducing the amount of paxil prior to sex (cut your dosage in half that day).  SAD can be minimized by adding vitamin B12 in the fall and winter."
