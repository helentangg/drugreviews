"I&#039;ve had panic and anxiety really bad for 18 years. Some days where ok and other days where terrible . I forgot really what normal felt like. In 2012 it just got worse. Panic attacks every day.  I couldn&#039;t control it no more. I broke down and seeked help. My Dr put me on lexpro.  I was super scared at first to take it because of all the storys on the internet about it. I had a few side effects, but nothing to bad.  Best thing I ever did. Been on lexpro for over two years now and not one single panic attack. I feel like a totally normal person, it&#039;s great. My life improved 100%, and that&#039;s no lie."
