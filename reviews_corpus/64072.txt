"I&#039;ve been on 25mg of Zoloft for 7 days now and during that time I had 3 good days and 4 bad days. Thus is actually pretty good since I haven&#039;t had a good day in 2 months. Based on other reviews and the general use, I&#039;m very lucky to seeing some good days since they say it could take 2 weeks and between 50 and 200mg. I&#039;m hopeful I don&#039;t have to go up and continue the horrible ride I&#039;ve been on trying different antidepressants and benzos which I blame for a lot of my anxiety."
