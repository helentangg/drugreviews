"Took this medication for two years for depression. Didn&#039;t do much to help lift or regulate my moods, but didn&#039;t cause insomnia or nightmares. Taking this medicine on an empty stomach resulted in nausea, cramps, and vomiting. Make sure to eat breakfast if you&#039;re taking it in the morning."
