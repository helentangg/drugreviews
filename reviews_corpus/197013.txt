"I was givin paxil by my doctor, and It works wonders.

It is rare that I even feel most anxiety, and I haven&#039;t had an attack in months. I&#039;ve been on it a couple years and have yet to feel it stop working.

BUT, do not take this if you aren&#039;t willing to have a long time commitment with it. One thing the doctor won&#039;t tell you about straight up is the withdrawal. I&#039;ve tried to come off of paxil, out of frustration mostly at the withdrawal effects, and all I can describe it as is a living hell. Confusion blurred vision, brain zaps, vertigo, nausea, depression, increased anxiety, etc. Not for the faint of heart. If you can, go with something else."
