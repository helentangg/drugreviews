"I have been on this medicine for 3 months now, I am on 20mg per day. 
The first tablet I took was a complete trip, then with the other tablets I did not have any weird feelings as if I was high.
I had some side effects such as light tremors in my hands and thirst.
I did not drink any alcohol for 1.5 months, I discovered wine brings up my depression so I do not drink wine any more.
Just a glass of whisky every now and then. 
The first three weeks were a bit rough but things started to move forwards in a very pleasent way, family and friends noticed I smile all the time and yes I deffo feel happier.
Anxiety levels have come down, although I do have probably a panic attack a month.
This medicine has been a life saver for me, I have no emotions"
