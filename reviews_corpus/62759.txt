"I suffer from quite bad depression, anxiety, and panic attacks - most of which are emotional, some of which are physical. I first tried 20mg Prozac, but this was far too harsh and made me feel manic. I then tried 10mg citalopram, and the result was a gentle and natural rise in mood, and no side effects. I was very happy with it. However my body soon adjusted to it, and the effect was less. I increased to 20mg, then 30mg. It helps with anxiety and low mood, but I use it in conjunction with CBT."
