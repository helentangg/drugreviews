"Been on this medication now for 10 months after Fluoxetine made me worse. This medication has worked wonders for my Panic disorder and depression. Even though I still have these illnesses and it will be a long recovery journey I can say that this medication along with a hospital stay due to the adverse side effects of the Fluoxetine and regular appointments with my CPN and Psychiatrist has really worked well for me."
