"When I first took Sertraline I felt worse in the first two weeks, shaking all over, felt sick did not think I could continue with the drug. I had to go back to the doctor, he increased the dose from 50mg to 100mg still felt dreadful, however two and a half months later I feel I am getting my life back although I still have a little way to go. Glad I stuck with the drug although it has been a very tough ride."
