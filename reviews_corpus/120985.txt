"I am amazed by this drug.  I suffer from extreme general anxiety, insomnia as well as adult ADD.  I have been on celexa, worked for about 6 months.  Zoloft, not bad stablizes emotions but doesn&#039;t get rid of anxiety. Wellutrin, made me so depressed.  I was actually given this drug as off market for hot flashes while still on zoloft.  Well I went off the zoloft immediately because this drug worked so well.  First time ever (other than taking benzos) I had no butterflies in my stomach, fear over nothing and slept better. I can&#039;t believe the difference in finding the right drug.  I don&#039;t really suffer from depression, I only get depressed because of my anxiety and chronic insomnia.    This has been a miracle drug for me."
