"Having suffered with irritable bowel syndrome for about 20 years and experiencing bloated stomach and being doubled up with stomach pains after virtually every meal I had consulted a specialist, tried various diets and self-medication and had no relief. This lead to me feeling constantly worn out and depressed. I really thought I was stuck with this for life and then ... I was prescribed amitriptyline. I started with 20mg and gradually increased to 50mg over a period of 6 months. The dosage was then gradually decreased and I was fine until I got down to 10mg, when the pains started to come back again. I increased to 20mg, which I have been taking for about 2 years and other than the occasional short flare-up, I have been fine. I have my life back again!"
