"My psychiatrist prescribed Lexapro to treat general anxiety, which it barely impacted, and since starting it 4 weeks ago I&#039;ve become severely depressed and spend all day contemplating suicide. I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s entirely the medicine&#039;s fault, or if it even had anything to do with it, but it certainly hasn&#039;t helped me with anything, and I can&#039;t find anything online about it actually worsening depression instead of treating it."
