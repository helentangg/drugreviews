"Been on Lexapro for about 3 weeks after a bad break up. First week was bad, usual side effects. But the past week things have settled down. I feel like I can function at work better. Before that I was totally useless. I still need to address some emotional issues but now I can see some light...Am waiting for the full effects to kick in SOON."
