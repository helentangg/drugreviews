"I started using this medication 11 days ago. I started taking the medication because my depression was beginning to worsen. I had been off medicines for a while but just reached a point where I would benefit from them again. In the past I used Celexa, Lexapro, and Paxil. The sexual side effects of those medicines were intolerable. The Viibryd awakened me from what felt like a walking sleep. I am more outgoing, social, and have a desire to the things that I stopped doing during my decline. The main side effect has been diarrhea."
