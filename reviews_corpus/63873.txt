"Very grateful to my doctor recommending this medication when I was very reluctant to try anti-depressants. Suffered from depression for ten years, had a period of severe depression ten years ago. Felt myself entering a period of severe depression again but very reluctant to try medication as many family members had bad experiences. Sertraline has really helped me to have some breathing space during this time and given me some mental clarity to make it through the day. The side effects were brutal, I felt very sick and zoned out in the first three days and it did seem to make me feel worse mentally the first few weeks of taking it. There were many times I wanted to give it up, took 6-8 weeks to feel full effect"
