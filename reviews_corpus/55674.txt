"On Pristique for two years with good results, then started getting really depressed.  Doc prescribed 150 mg of Effexor for six weeks.  I didn&#039;t feel any better and was having horrible nightmares and constipation.  I was so disgusted so I weaned myself off over period of six weeks.
  I thought I was going insane, the nightmares increased and I was jumping out of bed during the night with leg cramps ,was nauseated and dizzy. 
When the dizziness got so bad that I fell down, I went to ER and they told me that was withdrawal symptoms and go back to doc.  Now I am down to 37,5 mg a day. Nightmares not so severe but have terrible leg cramps. Hope to be off after one more week."
