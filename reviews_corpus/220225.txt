"I suffered with extreme leg pain for two years only when I was lying down. I was on Panadol (No good) then Tramadol (No good) I had so many sleepless nights or nights where I had to sleep sitting up. I was fine walking around but the moment I laid down the pain started. My doctor put me on Amitriptyline 10mg and after a week of being on it I have had no pain at all and sleep all night. I have been on it for just over a year. Happy person."
