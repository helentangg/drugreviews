"I have been taking Cymbalta for about 2 years.  I can tell a major difference with an over all improvement and/or tolerance level of pain; I can ,as well, tell that it seems to improve the efficacy of two other medications I am given (morphine and tramadol) Or prescribed, as compared to when I (have done one or two trial periods purposefully x1 and accidentally) missed 4-7 days of not taking the Cymbalta."
