"I am 30 yo female and have been taking Zoloft for 4 days now &amp; I am definitely starting to feel a difference. My thoughts don&#039;t race constantly &amp; I don&#039;t worry constantly about every terrible thing that could potentially happen to me or my family. I&#039;ve been more patient with my kids &amp; less picky at my husband. I had nausea for the first day but that passed. I still feel tired a lot though and have had some tightness in my chest. My most uncomfortable side effect is feeling the need to yawn all the time. The other reviews have given me hope that if I wait it out my side effects will improve. Thanks to all of you for sharing your experiences."
