"Ugh - Taking this medicine was a big mistake. My Doctor&#039;s recommendation turned out to be a bad one. I&#039;m currently 60 days in with  and feel more anxious than before beginning zoloft. There were some days where i didn&#039;t obsess over stressful things in my life, but the bad very much out weighed the good. All day long at work i have been feeling like a nervous wreck. Also, know that it will destroy your sex life. My libido is non-existant as of now. This created even more anxiety and stress with the vicious circle of failure. This medicine just made me a frustrated mess. I&#039;m going to look into wellbutrin and try and be hopeful.
