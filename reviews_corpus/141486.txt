"I have been dealing with depression and anxiety since I was a teenager. I&#039;m in college now, and finally coming to terms that I have both. I have seasonal depression. I tried several other big name medication since I came to terms with my depress.and anxi.  Escitalopram  has made a huge change in the pass few weeks of taking it. Even my professor said I look so much happier. I&#039;m not pulling at my hair(anxiety) and only reason why I wont get out of bed is now b.c I&#039;m sleepy in the morning and not sad. I have more energy now and much happier in general. Beside yawning*sideeffect... I&#039;m doing well. week 4."
