"The medication did not treat my symptoms that were unique to PTSD, namely nightmares/re-experiencing.  I was on a high dose of this drug, 300 mg/day, and then went higher and combined it with lamictal as a mood stabilizer. It unfortunately increased the moments of panic, and made me feel out of control when making decisions in a stressed environment, which is unfortunately the opposite of what I would expect a PTSD medication to do. I made worse decisions on this drug than without it, and felt panicked and stressed more often."
