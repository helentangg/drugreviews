"I have been on Pristiq for about 14 days now...I love it ! I have NEVER been on any medications. I have 5 year old twins and felt tired, moody and couldn&#039;t wait until bed time. I am up early now and have the energy to deal with it all. I have noticed some weight loss, which I really don&#039;t need to lose any, but a few pounds would be nice. I only had side effects for a few days. My life is going great now."
