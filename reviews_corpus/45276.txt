"The first three weeks at 20 mg was tempestuous at best, however I truly felt as if I was turning the corner so to speak.
I suffer from somatic anxiety more then the mental part of it.
Fatigue, and headaches were common. Sleep disturbances also.
I had some great half days. After increasing the meds to 40 mg a day for two months, I decided to drop back down to 20 mgs. I lost a fair bit of weight the first 6 weeks, around 6 kilos, however after 3 months I&#039;ve put it back on and then some. Will be discussing other options with my Docter soon. I would also say that anxiety or manic episodes were increased during the dosage increase, which was treated with Clonazapam."
