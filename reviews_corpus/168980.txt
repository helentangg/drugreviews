"I have been on Zoloft and Celexa, both just taking the edge off, for the last 7 yrs. I had been in a pretty deep depression for the last few months, so my PCP suggested Viibryd. She told me to take it in the morning with food for the nausea. I took the 10mg dose with half my daily Celexa dose for the first week. I felt a difference on day 1. The clutter cleared up, unreasonable emotions were easier to control, I actually felt happy. I have experienced mild gastrointestinal issues, evening sweets cravings and stomach bloat, none of which I realized were side effects until reading up here. I am now on my second week of 40mg/day doses, feeling great. I combat the restless leg (read: whole body) by dosing in the morning with food. I have very high hopes for this medicine."
