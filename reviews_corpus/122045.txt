"After trying multiple different antidepressants (such as, Prozac and Celexa) I was finally put on Effexor. As far as it treating my depression and anxiety, it has helped enormously. BUT the side effects are unreal. Even after a day of missing my 150mg dosage I will experience brain &quot;zaps&quot; or brain &quot;shivers&quot;. It is an annoying and scary sensation. I have experienced extreme drowsiness, and yet no weight gain."
