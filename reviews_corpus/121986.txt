"I was having extreme hot flashes and started taking Effexor 75 mg and it almost immediately stopped 95% of them. I am up to 150 mg per day now and the only issue I have with the medication is the horrible withdrawal symptoms. I was without insurance for a month and within 2 days of not taking it I was at the hospital with what I thought was the flu. My Doctor had warned me not to stop cold turkey but I had no idea it would be that severe. But if you take as directed and discontinue with your Doctor&#039;s help there should be no problem. The pros definitely outweigh the cons."
