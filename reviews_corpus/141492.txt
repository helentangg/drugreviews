"I was experiencing a lot of anxiety and depression and panic attacks.  My first reaction to my anxiety was to drink alcohol.  Since alcohol is a depressant, that made everything worse.  Now that I am on this medication, I feel like I&#039;m back old self - and I have no desire for alcohol (which should not be taken with this medication anyway).  I started with 10mg initially and had a lot of side effects (nausea, diarrhea, etc.) and was very lethargic, so I cut it in half and tried again.  I can&#039;t tell you how much this medication has helped me.  Remember, our body chemistries are all different, so sometimes adjustment have to be made initially.  Now I&#039;m on 10mg and I feel like a new woman."
