"I took this in an attempt to prevent my migraines that occurred several times each month. During the two weeks that I took this at bedtime I had an increase in migraines (3-4/month became 3 in 2 weeks) and had at least 2 incidents where I got out of bed and did things - including going for a drive - that I woke the next morning with no memory of the night before!"
