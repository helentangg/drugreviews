"After working my way up to 40 mg a day, the vivid horrible dreams stopped.. Mood wasn&#039;t much different. After I think 4 days on the 40 mg, I had a black out rage that landed me in in the psych ward for 2 weeks and now doing a partial program. One Dr thinks it might be due to the fact that I had gastric bypass. Don&#039;t know but I will NEVER use that again."
