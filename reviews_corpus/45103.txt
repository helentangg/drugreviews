"I&#039;m pretty much the same as the most recent poster.

I have severe OCD to the point where I lost my family through it an have been battling with alcohol for a nber of years now.

I stopped taking my flu when I &#039;thought&#039; I felt better. Not realising the flu was the reason my moods where gone and my obsessions limited down to a more handable level. 

I&#039;m back on 60mg now and feel really good. On top of councilling and then CBT I&#039;m moving forward and will get my life back on track.

Stopping my medication was one of the worst things I&#039;ve done."
