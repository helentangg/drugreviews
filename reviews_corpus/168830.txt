"This medication simply saved my life.  Addiction took me down a dangerous path - hiding bottles, attempting to obtain more prescription pain killers, doing it all at night to hide from wife/kids...long dark road for sure.   30 days intensive recovery in a facility, away from everyone just for me, AA meeting and my doctor put me on anti-depressants that just made me groggy, disoriented and volatile at times.   Changed a few times till we hit Viibryd.  Absolutely amazing from the first few days. 40mg and sometimes a tad more when the waves of irrationality come.  Mostly even sailing.  Life is enjoyable, work is productive and I am totally plugged back into everyone&#039;s life at home.  No issues with side effects at all."
