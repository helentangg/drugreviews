"I have been on Pristiq for 12 days. It has helped me tremendously with my depression issues. A few years ago I had tried wellbuterin, lexapro and cymbalta and experienced side effects. I gave up but recently decided it was in my best interested to try something else. Pristiq has completely changed my whole outlook on life. I do have problems sleeping and have dry mouth someitmes but totally worth it."
