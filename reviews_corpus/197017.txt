"Paxil has been great. Within less than a week I was feeling better than I have felt in a long time. I have OCD, anxiety issues, PTSD and postpartum depression and Paxil has helped me see a light. I can enjoy my baby girl and life again! I haven&#039;t experienced any of the side effects it says you experience."
