"I was on Elavil 10mg previously for a few years and had only a handful of migraines in all that time. I decided to stop it for a year to see how I would feel, eventually I went back to 4-5 migraine days a week. I&#039;ve been on it for two weeks again, most of the initial side effects have subsided (dizziness, fatigue and dry mouth - nothing unbearable) and I have not had a single migraine since I took the first pill. I&#039;m now on 20mg - I take it to also help with arthritic pain and symptoms of Crohn&#039;s disease. I feel better than I have in a long time. I sleep amazing and wake up feeling good and energized. I have never experienced weight gain on this medication - however I do eat very healthy and exercise regularly."
