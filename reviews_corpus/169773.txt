"I was given this for pain and insomnia.  Didn&#039;t take it at first because I have a fear of drugs but after being on this for a week I wish I had taken it sooner.  I am sleeping better and my pain is less.  I have fibromyalgia along with Panic/Anxiety.  This is a drug that helps it all with very few side effects for me (just dry mouth)."
