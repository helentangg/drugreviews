"My daughter suffered with vulvodynia for 2 years as a child at 5 years old.  After seeing numerous doctors, she saw a Dr at Univ of Michigan who prescribed Desipramine. It worked immediately and it was 100% effective.  After 2 years of treatment, my daughter was fine and the vulvodynia never returned."
