"I have been taking Zoloft now for 7 Years. I felt almost instant relief for about a week after first taking it only to come crashing back down again. I guess it was some kind of placebo effect. But sticking it out and uping my dose to 200mg a day, after about six weeks I felt so much better. I could function and instead of my mind having 100&#039;s of things running through it I could focus on the one thing and work through my problems. My only side effects was an upset tummy. But that passed. I&#039;m grateful for this medication. It saved my life."
