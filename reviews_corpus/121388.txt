"I have been taking Venlafaxine for one week. It seemed to help immediately when I started using it. At last I am no longer wrapped up in my own thoughts, going over the same thing again and again. I have obsessive thoughts due to a bad relationship with a relative. I am enmeshed in the relationship and have tried talking therapies and Prozac.
Nothing has given me relief like this medication. I have had only mild side effects, dry mouth, some loss of appetite."
