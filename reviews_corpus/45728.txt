"Very positive experience, I have tried Wellbutrin, Celexa, Pristiq, Cymbalta, Effexor and Prozac (Fluoxetine) is the only one I can take with no side effects.. All others I had to stop early on because of unbearable side effects. Fluoxetine makes me feel better but only at a lower dose. If I take 20mg or over I feel lethargic.  Give it a try!"
