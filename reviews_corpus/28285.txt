"This medication is fantastic.  I was suffering from some major anxiety for years and this has taken a huge burden off me.  There are still an occasional surge of anxiety but its an anomaly now where it used to be the norm for me. For those bad times I&#039;ll take Ativan and the combination between the two work awesome.  I only take about 4 Ativan a month,  the rest of the time Lexapro does the job. And I sleep SO much better."
