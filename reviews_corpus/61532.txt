"I take citalopram 20mg due to high levels of anxiety and panic attacks I kept getting heart palpitations and my blood pressure would go up. It got to a point it was really bad effecting my every day functioning making me want to frequently urinate every 20 mins on average I could not travel and did not want to go to social gatherings I would often be in fear that I would have a heart attack or a stroke due to the pounding sensation  I would feel on my heart that caused me a continuous discomfort as well as tightness in my chest I spent many occasions in and out of hospital and visited the doctors with frequency. Citalopram was the only medication to stop these symptoms of anxiety I was feeling all symptoms completely stopped."
