"I&#039;m being treated with nortriptyline for abdominal wall pain due to having irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) for almost 40 years now.  I still have pain in other areas but this does the trick for the abdominal pain, which is like the pain you get in your side after you&#039;ve been running for a long time.  It wasn&#039;t just a stabbing pain, though, it came, it stayed and wouldn&#039;t go away.  I only take 10mg and my prescription says to increase as necessary, but I&#039;ve been on it successfully for over a year now.  I stopped it once with the ok of the doctor but within three weeks the pain returned, so I started back up on it.  I do have the dry mouth and sometimes restless sleep but I can handle that...I couldn&#039;t handle the abdominal pain..this worked!"
