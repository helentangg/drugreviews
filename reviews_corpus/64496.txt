"I was on zoloft for about 3 months. It caused headaches especially as dosage was increased. Nearly impossible to sleep more than 5 hours. And caused hot flashes and racing thoughts at any dose over 100mg. It also increased my blood pressure. Started helping depression a bit after many helpless weeks but not enough to stay on it satisfactorily."
