"I have been on generic Lexapro for approx. 3.5 months. I suffered from severe anxiety and panic attacks on a daily and I was unsure as to why. I kept asking what is triggering this? I suffer from hashimotis thyroiditis and that is my only explanation. I constantly felt like I was gonna lose my mind.

First week of starting I was even more anxious, by month 3 I felt GREAT, forgot what it was like to have anxiety. I felt so good that I decided to not take it one day, BIG mistake. That was 4 days ago  and I feel like when I first started taking the SSRI. I&#039;m so anxious and had a panic attack last night. Minds been racing. Has anyone ever experienced this? Will I feel good again?"
