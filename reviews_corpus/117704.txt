"This medicine changed my life in a sense. I am on Latuda (an antipsychotic) and a lot of Wellbutrin, but I was still depressed and having migraines almost every day. I was put on only 30 mg a night to prevent headaches and to help me sleep. It certainly made me sleep a lot the first few nights. At first I was afraid it was a dud, but then 2 weeks later my migraines were less frequent; after 2 months on it, I have about 20 percent of the migraines I used to have. I get great sleep, and the best (and most surprising) part was that although it is a tiny dose, it was just what I needed to finally not be depressed and anxious. I only gave it 9 starts instead of ten because sometimes the dry mouth is unbearable at times."
