"I too started Pristiq after 17 years of being on antidepressants. I also have tried everything out there. I did not feel anything at all for the first 2 weeks. However, I started to have these slight body aches - never did I attribute this to the medicine. After another week on this medication, I also could not stay awake for longer than 2 hours at a time. I began having body aches. I could not make it through a day at work, I could barely get out of bed in the morning, and there was no way I could do my household chores. I had many blood tests ran and everything came back normal. I finally realized it may be the Pristiq and after just 3 days of being off of it, I was completely pain free and not tired."
