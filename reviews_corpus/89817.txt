"I have been taking Celexa for only three weeks but I&#039;ve already noticed a difference in my mood. I feel a bit more relaxed and the panic attacks are null if any. I started with 10mg for 4 days then up to 20mg which proved to be way too much for me so I backed down to 10mg and have felt great since. Side effects: some slight yawning here and there but not a big deal. I recommend this medicine for those with mild anxiety/depression."
