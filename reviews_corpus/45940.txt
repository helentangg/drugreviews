"I&#039;ve been on Prozac for many years. This medication has definitely improved my life. I had tried Zoloft first and had some strange side effects. I&#039;ve never had any adverse effects with Prozac. I don&#039;t feel any different except I feel so much better on it. I will continue to take it."
