"I&#039;m 17, about 125 pounds, female and a senior in high school. I&#039;ve had depression for a while and started taking Effexor. I strongly encourage trying this medicine for any teens or college students who deal with depression. Helps me concentrate and feel all together in a stable and happy mood. I&#039;ve had weight loss also only thing that makes me nervous is the withdrawal effects I&#039;ve read about."
