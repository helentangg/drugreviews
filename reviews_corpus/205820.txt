"I have now been on Pristiq for a month, by the way it takes that long for you to see a difference.  This is a good medicine. Calming, gives me a happy feeling upon waking. A general sense of well being.  I am BiPolar. Have Been on everything for the last 30 years. I kept going back to Prozac because it kept me skinny.  I do have to watch my weight with this drug but you won&#039;t gain if you don&#039;t increase your eating."
