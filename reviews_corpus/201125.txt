"Long story short I finally felt compelled to try anti depressants.
I had experienced depression for a couple of years and had bouts of anxiety. Last straw were symptoms similar to bipolar disorder. Like mania. I had been so reluctant to try meds.
But man I&#039;m glad I did. I&#039;m sad I didn&#039;t try them before. My life these couple years would have been so much better, less traumatic.
I started 50 mg of sertraline in July.
Right away I noticed my mood improved.
I used to be short tempered.
Now I am more patient.
I stopped crying every two days out of frustration due to my sons tantrums or misbehaviour.( challenging toddler) or from feeling overwhelmed with house work.

Little by little that fog of depression started to dissipate.
I am happy now."
