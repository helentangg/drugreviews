"I have been using Zoloft for about 9 years now. I&#039;ve tried most anti-depressants since I was about 21. I&#039;m 37 now.  I wouldn&#039;t recommend Zoloft to those under 25 as it worked better for me in my late 20s.  It doesn&#039;t cause weight gain which is good.  I don&#039;t have much of an appetite so I have small amounts of food which satisfy me.  At the start I got the normal side effects, diarrhea, agitation, sweating, etc. but it tends to get better over the years.  My worst time for depression was a week before my period so I just take a higher dose and it helps me a lot.  A friend of mine has started Pristiq (Desvenlafaxine) and she says its fantastic.  So much more energy which I&#039;m after as Zoloft doesn&#039;t give me much energy at all."
