"Hi, I&#039;ve been suffering from anxiety, panic attacks and sometimes depression but not serious depression, for around 3 months now due to an experience I had whilst taking MDMA. I had a panic attack the other night that led to me calling an ambulance because I felt faint, fast breathing then when the paramedics arrived my arms went numb due to my fast breathing, so I decided to see my GP the next day and he prescribed me with fluoxetine. Its now coming up to the sixth day of me using this medication and I kind of feel myself calmer, but this is only the first week. It was a kind of last resort thing to start and use medication so all fingers and toes crossed that I, and hope many more can overcome this anxiety and stress problem!"
