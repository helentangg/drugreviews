"Before taking Effexor XR I was suicidal, crying all the time and very depressed. I have now been on it for 13 years. I love it. I feel &quot;normal&quot;. only side effects I&#039;ve had are weight gain and chronic constipation. Due to my insurance not covering it anymore I now have to switch to Zoloft. I sure hope the Zoloft works as good as the Effexor XR did."
