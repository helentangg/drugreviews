"I have peripheral neuropathy and very bad pain in my back.  Cymbalta made a huge improvement in my pain level.  The doctor started me gradually to lessen the nausea.  I have worked up to 30 mg. twice a day for a total of 60 mg.  I have been taking it for 3 months and still find the pain level, and my frame of mind, much improved.  I do have slight nausea occasionally, and dry mouth.  The excessive sweating has gone away."
