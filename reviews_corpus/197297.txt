"This medication has evened me out so well so far. Been on it for about a month and what a different. I couldn&#039;t lose my temper if I wanted to, and my anxiety and irrational fears have subsided. Very calm since on this... so much that I&#039;m back with my ex-boyfriend who can now trust me not to argue anymore!"
