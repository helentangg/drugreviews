"I was prescribed Amitriptyline 10mg nightly for nerve pain. I have had spinal surgery involving a C5/6 discectomy, while C4/5 and C6/7 are prolapsed. With the C6/7 prolapse worsening the pain through my neck, upper back, shoulder and arm was becoming unbearable. Although the initial pain at the C6/7 disc site has not completely gone (due to the disc nearing surgery stage) I have found it gave me great relief from my peripheral pain allowing me to get some sleep. The side effects in the first few days was a bit of confusion, felt a bit dizzy and tired, my husband saw me through the first couple of days, it was worth it. I have had cortisones and am now coming off all tablets. Headaches, but not bad."
