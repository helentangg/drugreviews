"Cymbalta has given me such great relief from pain for many years. Unfortunately I fall in the 1% of severe side effects. I&#039;ve had no need for narcotics except for acute pain for migraines or injuries during this time. Unfortunately I have put on so much weight and my liver is enlarged and enzymes are high due to taking this medicine. Even with years of intense exercising 3-5 days a week I was unable to lose any significant weight. I must now stop taking it and I don&#039;t know of anything else that will give me this relief. Still highly recommend this for others who are most likely not going to have this trouble. But be aware just in case you fall in the 1% also. Especially if taking other medicines."
