"Just took it at its smallest available dose this past week. I was replacing my Zoloft because I felt that my depression is more of a reaction to my anxiety, so my doc put me on this which is known to treat both, unlike Zoloft which only treats depression. I have yet to experience any bad side effects like many do in the beginning, and if anything it actually treated the side effects of getting off Zoloft, like nerve tingliness. It gives me an overall sense of calm, and unlike other anxiety meds, it doesn&#039;t sacrifice by concentration and memory which is very important since I&#039;m a full time student. It calmed my anxiety and allowed me to sleep, which in result, I don&#039;t feel depression. A+ on this medication so far."
