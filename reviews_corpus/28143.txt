"Been on Lexapro for 2 days.  Horrible nausea, headache.  My husband asked the pharmacist about help with this.  She recommended an over-the-counter liquid called Ematrol.  Used by children and adults.  It helped.  Also sipped ginger ale as needed.  Feel very out-of-body, shaky but trying to stick it out as everyone seems to say the first day/week is hell, but then all is good.  Am continuing on Klonopin, per my psychiatrist&#039;s recommendation, until the Lexapro kicks in.  Will try taking it at night, as this seems easier to &quot;ride out&quot; the side effects through sleep."
