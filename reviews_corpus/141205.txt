"I was terribly bullied in high school, made fun of my sexuality and developed an extremely high amount of social anxiety. I would shudder at the thought of going to school. I had lost hope.  Visited a psychiastrist. Was prescribed Escitalopram. The medicine did not seem as if it was working in the first few months. 
I was given anti anxiety medicines too so I always credited them whenever I felt better. However,  it has almost been an year and now I am only on Escitlopram. I realised I do not need to take any medicine at all because I am just soo confident. I realised that i am suddenly not at all hesitant to go for movies or anywhere
Confidence = restored and depression = forgotten."
