"I was having migraines just about daily. Started taking amitriptyline at first 25mg, then 50mg, then 75mg daily. Effects: reduced the frequency and intensity of the migraines both by roughly 70%. Side effects:  Full night sleeps. Major appetite gain (literally, a pathological obsession with food) and weight gain became out of control. 
Reduced to 50 mg amitriptyline daily, managed to lose the 12 lb weight gained.
We kept it at 50mg with only moderate increase in appetite and complete night sleeps. 
Doctor started me on beta-blocker Propanolol 30mg. No side effects.
So 50mg amitriptyline   30mg propanolol has resulted to completely stop of migraines (except for possibly a very stressful day which will provoke one)."
