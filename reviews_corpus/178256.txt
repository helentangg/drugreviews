"I took Cymbalta for 1 year. It did help with my depression however, I became very lethargic and gained 25 lbs within 3 months. The weight gain scared me because I had never gained that much in such a short period of time. Also, I did have serious constipation with Cymbalta. If you can handle the wieght gain and constipation, I think Cymbalta is the medication to at least try, it does work-or it at least worked with my depression."
