"This medicine has been an absolute miracle. I was very skeptical about taking an antidepressant again after the horrible side effects from Zoloft, but my doctor let me know how much she thought this would be different and help me. I suffer from Generalized Anxiety Disorder with Panic Attacks, and also depression. Not the kind of StayInBedAndCryAllDay type, but I am always irritable and snap at people easily. I take 5mg each morning and I am right as rain. The first week the side effects were nausea and diarrhea, with drowsiness. Once the first week was over my husband and I noticed a HUGE difference. Things that I would once snap about didn&#039;t phase me. I was genuinely happy again. You won&#039;t regret trying this."
