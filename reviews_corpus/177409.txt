"I had been on Zoloft for 8 years before it just stopped working. Doctor switched me to Cymbalta and I was very fortunate that it worked, really well for 6 years. Unfortunately, my insurance company switched approval for this to the generic version, which absolutely is not the same. It slowly started losing efficacy. So my doctor had to increase my daily dosage (on the generic version) from 60 mg to 90 mg. At 60 mg, I had didn&#039;t have sexual side effects, but I did at 90 mg, which was not acceptable to me. So back down to 60 mg I went. Now I&#039;m having &quot;break through&quot; symptoms again: anger, irritability, lack of interest in things. I&#039;m not sure what I&#039;ll do, but I&#039;m pretty sure I have to switch meds completely again."
