"I&#039;m a 17 year old girl with Generalized Anxiety Disorder which I&#039;ve struggled/am struggling with all throughout high school. I&#039;ve been on Prozac for about 8 months now and it&#039;s helped me get through a lot of very anxiety-inducing situations for me. Before taking this medication, it had become very difficult for me to even attend school, and often times I&#039;d have to be absent due to panic attacks and overwhelming anxiety. The Prozac has made everyday life so much more bearable for me. I no longer feel repressed by my anxiety. It&#039;s not a &quot;cure&quot; but it has helped a ton for me, and I have much hope for the future now. In addition, it is also helpful with my mood."
