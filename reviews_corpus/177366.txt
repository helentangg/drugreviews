"I had/having a horrible time with this medication. Currently trying to wean off with my MDs help. I&#039;ve had every listed side effect and subsequent health problems that required expensive work ups. Most dramatically I developed vertigo and severe headaches after being on the med for about 3-4 months. Vertigo was debilitating and required time off of work and multiple doctor appointments to rule out other conditions.  I also had electrical zings and numbness and tingling down my body. The weaning has been the most problematic causing these awful side effects to worsen. I&#039;m a registered nurse and I would never recommend this drug to anybody. I did not feel any benefits for my depression."
