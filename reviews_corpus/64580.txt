"Wow is all I can say. I didn&#039;t  realize just how bad I really was until I started taking Zoloft. I lived in a world fighting panic every day....so angry and depressed. I didn&#039;t even know who I was anymore. I&#039;ve been taking 50 mg daily for 2 weeks and am a completely different person. The  side  effects  were minimal and manageable the first week and now are gone. Thank you Zoloft!!!!!"
