"I had to start at 5 mg and work my way up because I&#039;m a baby, but I definitely feel better and oddly enough, my headaches have improved after 20 years. I don&#039;t feel any different, I&#039;m just worrying less and not feeling the physical symptoms of anxiety. It still comes and goes a small bit, but it&#039;s WAY better!"
