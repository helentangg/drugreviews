"Have been on this medication (between 10-20mg) for around 3 years now. I have literally tried all SSRI&#039;S as well as wellbutrin, TCA and a few others. Escitalopram is the only one so far that can keep me stable enough to function. I still have emotions ( not zombie like) and I can cry and feel sad when I need to. Sometimes I have a hard time sleeping, but I take melatonin and it helps a lot. When I am not on this medication, I am on the floor curled into a ball, a crying, terrified mess. It helps me function well enough to keep a job and raise my children. Sometimes my thoughts start to run, but then I just try and rationalize them( can&#039;t do this without med) and I can usually get my mind back under control fairly quickly."
