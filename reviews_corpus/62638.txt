"I will say that i was skeptical about this med. I have taken everything under the sun for depression/bi-polar. I was on wellbutrin and abilify and i liked the abilify but found there was no real improvement in my ability to control my anger. I know alot of that comes from within but i need to knwo what it feels like first to be able to know how to recognize when i am going to far. I have been off kilter for so long that the anger felt &quot;normal&quot;, the depression felt &quot;normal&quot; and the suicidal tendancies felt &quot;normal&quot;.
After about 2 weeks of taking this I feel better. I was just thinking about the last time I thought about suicide and it has been a bit. (it was seriously everyday several times a day). I don&#039;t feel the urge to cut myself."
