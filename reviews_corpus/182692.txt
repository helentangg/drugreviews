"I have never in my life functioned properly until cymbalta, I have gone from panic attacks  , to public speaking with no hesitation , I finally have a real life , I don&#039;t over stress , I no longer ruminate , no shakings , no lasting side effects ,  a bit hyper and loss of libido but sorted out in a few months, I never want to come of it , changed my life totally , been on 60 mgs for 20 months"
