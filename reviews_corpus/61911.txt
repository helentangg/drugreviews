"I&#039;ve been taking citalopram for over ten years now.  I still have very low periods that can last for a couple of weeks. I rely heavily on my family telling me if I have been a pain in the ass to live with because I&#039;m not always aware how low I get. I have been told that I will probably be on it for the rest of my life. I was 30 when I started and I&#039;m now 42.  I have only attempted suicide once and that was at the beginning.  It&#039;s not something I can talk about to work mates and I don&#039;t go to a shrink anymore ( hate that word but can&#039;t spell psychiatrist) anyway the citalopram has certainly helped me."
