"Tried many drugs over the past 20 years.  This is the best yet.  No strange feelings in the head,
no twitching muscles or fog.  Some stomach discomfort which was solved by splitting the l0 milligram tablet in two and taking morning and afternoon.  The quality of my life has improved 
beautifully, and I am so grateful for it."
