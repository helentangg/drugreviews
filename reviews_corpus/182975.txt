"I was on Cymbalta for a few years, and over that time, I didn&#039;t notice a significant reduction in the pain, but I did notice that my memory started to diminish.

I asked my doctor to take me off of it, but he refused, so I quit cold-turkey.  The side effects are significant and severe!  I wouldn&#039;t suggest this tactic!

All in all, I&#039;m very happy to be off of it... my memory is improving noticeably, and the foot pain is just about the same."
