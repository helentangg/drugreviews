"The relief of pain was almost immediate. I have fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis as well. The meds localize the pain to a tolerable condition.
I take the pill first thing in the mornings and it leaves me light-headed and fatigued until late afternoon.
I wonder if these symptoms go away after a few months? Will my body get used to it?"
