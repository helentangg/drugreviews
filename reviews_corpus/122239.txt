"I have found that Effexor XR is the most effective drug for my anxiety disorder and depression. I have had basically no side effects from the medicine and it has helped control both issues. I have noticed withdrawals even if one dose is missed. I have been taking 150 mg daily for three years and overall am very pleased."
