"I wish I would have taken this medicine years ago. It took my life imploding (breakup with fiance who I truly love) to open my eyes. He couldn&#039;t deal with my extreme mood swings, irrational jealousy and constant negative thoughts anymore.  I started taking Zoloft by recommendation of a new doctor, taking 100mg. I have now been taking it for 5 weeks and it is amazing.  I actually noticed a difference within 2 days. Its like I used to have a constant negative &quot;soundtrack&quot; running through my head all the time. It&#039;s like all those negative things came to a screeching halt. I still feel and care, but I don&#039;t have this negative down feeling any more like I did.  It is amazing, I feel like life and the world is bright and good again."
