"I&#039;m a disabled vet due to migraines and have been on many medicines to both prevent and treat.  I have botox injections every 90 days and a constant supply of Imitrex injections to which I take approx 8 times a months.  I notice a HUGE difference when taking the nortriptyline (75mg a night).  I love that it helps me sleep.  I just can&#039;t forget to take it, if I do: hello migraine."
