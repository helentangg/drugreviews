"This is about my boyfriend who is currently taking this med. He is acting differently sometimes acting like he doesn&#039;t care about anything. He got rashes on some of his body. He is not the same. I&#039;m trying to talk him into trying something else. I don&#039;t like the side effects I&#039;m seeing in him. He&#039;s still depressed so it&#039;s not really helping him. He&#039;s like dr. Jekyl &amp; Hyde. He  will snap 1 minute then the next minute he&#039;s talking very nice as if nothing happened or he didn&#039;t remember saying anything mean. It&#039;s been a roller coaster I think I would rather have him not on anything or prescribed medical marijuana for his anxiety &amp; to help him relax. I don&#039;t know what the right answer is. Maybe we will find something in the near future to help."
