"Upped dose from 5mg to 10mg and again was scared. Still no signs of pain relief but it has only been about 6 days since starting. As for side effects - a bit of a dry mouth and slight grogginess for an hour. Nothing that I can&#039;t deal with. The dry mouth only lasts for ten minutes. 

Not sure what If I will have to increase dose but so far so good."
