"I was started on Cymbalta for pain at 30 mg per day the first month.  I experienced mild disruption of sleep for a few nights, but no other side effects.  My pain was initially reduced by 70% but began to wear off by evening.  Second month my dose was upped to 60 mg per day, which I take at lunch time.  My neck pain and neuropathy in hands and feet have been reduced by 90% which is like a miracle to me.  I have been able to resume yoga and biking.  Life is very good now.  I was switched to generic Duloxetine with no loss of benefit and no more side effects. I&#039;m one of the lucky ones who does not suffer many side effects from medications.  My sister cannot use this one at all."
