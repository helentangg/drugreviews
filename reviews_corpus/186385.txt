"I have severe depression to the point I feel so angry I don&#039;t want to talk to anyone and I stay in my room. I started Pristiq 3 weeks ago and after 2 weeks I almost stopped taking this medication because my irritability got so bad for three days. Like I said I did not want to talk. Then it just kicked in and I actually took my kids to the park and we played it. Doesnt sound like a big deal but for me it was. I can&#039;t remember the last time I did this without forcing myself. My husband actually told me today that I&#039;m acting like the wife he married. I just hope I stay this way. So sorry to ramble but I feel great. I can&#039;t remember the last time I felt this good and I&#039;m not just going through the motions."
