"I was so stressed out, everytime I mentioned work or my boss, I would start crying.  My doctor took a long time visiting with me and prescribed Citalopram.  In less than a week I was able to see the bright side at work, and now I can tell when I accidentally skip a dose.  I am much more relaxed and pleasant and see others&#039; actions in a more positive light."
