"Took for 2 years. Seemed to help with GAD after a month or so, and was taking in conjunction with alprazolam. VERY expensive med, so I strongly suggest finding a prescription discount card or coupon ($41 was the cheapest I ever paid-WITH my insurance it was $75)!  Do NOT miss a dose or you will get what I call &quot;zilches&quot; (feels like a painless yet bothersome &amp; annoying electrical shock feeling from your shoulders to your fingertips). After I stopped taking it because I just couldn&#039;t afford it, and it didn&#039;t seem to be helping anymore, it took about a month for the &quot;zilches&quot; to go away. Again, they&#039;re not painful, just a very weird feeling. also caused some weight gain. Starting Effexor ER tomorrow, so we&#039;ll see how that goes."
