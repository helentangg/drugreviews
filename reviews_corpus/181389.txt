"I wasn&#039;t sure if this drug was helping with OCD.  When asked I would reply, &quot;it seems to make it easier to deal with it&quot;.  Then my Doc decided to lower my dose in order to take me off it.  When I got to 60mg I lost it.  The obsessive thoughts were out of control.  Compulsions increased as well.  I am back on 100mg and feeling and thinking much better.  The med helps a lot, but doesn&#039;t fix me completely.  I challenge my compulsions every day so I can reinforce that I do not need them."
