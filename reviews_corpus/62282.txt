"I am just starting my 3rd week on Celexa. I was more upset when I found out this was for &quot;depression and anxiety&quot; as I am NOT depressed. I am a very outgoing person that loves to be around people but I do have anxiety, panic attacks and anger issues, so I thought it would be worth trying. I find myself more &quot;Calm&quot; in general since taking this. I am not obsessing about phobia&#039;s I have, and I am back to being 90% happy because I am dealing with stress better. I have been incredibly nauseous though this past week in the early morning to about lunch time. By mid afternoon to evening that goes away, but I do not like that feeling. No interruption in sleep. I do feel &quot;forgetful&quot; more than normal. Overall doing well."
