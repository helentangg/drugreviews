"I have been taking nortriptyline 10 mg for migraine prevention for about 6 weeks and have had only 2 headaches, both of which were controlled with just one dose of OTC pain reliever (Aleve). I was having headaches and other &quot;atypical&quot; migraines 3-4 times a week. The only side effect I&#039;ve noticed at this low dosage is dry mouth, and that&#039;s no big deal. So far I&#039;m very pleased with the positive results."
