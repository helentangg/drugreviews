"I lost my hand in a car accident about 3 year&#039;s ago I got rsd because of that. Nothing truly helped my pain until I got on Amitriptyline. With chronic pain it takes all your energy but Amitriptyline helped me get my life back. I still have very bad days but I&#039;m able to clean again play with my kids. Thank too Amitriptyline I love life again."
