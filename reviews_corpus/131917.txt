"I have been on Efferor XR for years to treat depression. I was on Premarin for a couple years following a hysterectomy but due to my family history and the stroke risks related to taking Premarin, I discontinued that medicine - only to experience hot flashes.  They weren&#039;t half as bad as I expected until I had a few days lapse in taking my Effexor!  The frequency and intensity of my hot flashes increased extensively.  I was having the flashes anywhere from 30 to 60 minutes apart and they were ten times worse!  I had little sleep and even less patience!  Some may call it a coincidence, but I&#039;m certainly going to pick up my Effexor on time from this day forward!"
