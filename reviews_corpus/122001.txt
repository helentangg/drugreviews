"I have suffered with hot flashes since my late teens and began menopause at 50. I tried Effexor XR just to see if it would help and was so surprised with the RELIEF that I got from it. It helped so much. It didn&#039;t stop them. I don&#039;t think anything can, but it sure did cut the number of hot flashes by at least half. When I do have one, it&#039;s a butt-kicker, but by cutting the number in half, my quality of life has been improved so much. Between the Effexor XR and Topamax putting a complete halt to my migraines, life is really good again!"
