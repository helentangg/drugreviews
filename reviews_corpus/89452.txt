"I have always struggled with anxiety about little things....Thinking I&#039;m dying over something, or wake up worried if I was going to be worried today (i know, not normal). I would get obsessed with something happening to me. I would be worried someone might break in the house and kept the kitchen light on all night. My brain just couldn&#039;t shake things and it would consume me that I felt like I was going crazy. My poor family! I finally agreed to starting meds and my doc started me on celexa. The first few weeks I had anxiety about if the pill was going to work or if I needed to go to a &quot;better&quot; brand but after about 2 months I started feeling like a whole new person, its been 5 months now and I don&#039;t ever want to get off them."
