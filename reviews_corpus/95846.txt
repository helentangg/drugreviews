"Very good, only problem I ever had was due to my own fault. It was when I kept forgetting to get my prescription refilled and it got to the point where it was about 2 weeks without it and I was very emotional and depressed. Not suicidal Just depressed. Probably 10 times worse then when I started the medication. It was very bad. Just take your medication and you should be fine. I missed a few days after that once or twice and nothing out of the ordinary happened. It was only because I went off for so long without weaning myself off. Overall great!"
