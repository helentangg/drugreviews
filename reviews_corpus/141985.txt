"I have been on Lexapro once daily in the morning since 2006. I took it in 2004 but had to stop when I got pregnant. I suffer from cyclothymia, which is a bipolar spectrum disorder that includes chronic depression, anxiety, mood swings and irritability. Lexapro is a great medicine for those who it works for. Little side effects. I currently take 30mg Lexapro. I started taking Wellbutrin SR 100mg about 5 months ago to help me with my loss of motivation and inability to get out of bed in the morning (I want to sleep a lot). I still have some irritability and mood swings so my doctor gave me Seroquel XR 50mg to try 3 hours prior to bedtime beginning tonight."
