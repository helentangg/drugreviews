"Effexor saved my life 2 years ago. I was extremely stressed, anxious and feeling as if suicide would be the only way out. This turned everything around. I have gotten two promotions at my job, my social circle has increased tenfold, and I always feel on top of my game. I have gained 20 lbs but probably because now I actually go out and do stuff. The withdrawals do suck at first if you forget a dose. I was scared to try it at first but I&#039;m glad I did."
