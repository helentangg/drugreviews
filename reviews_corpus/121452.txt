"Effexor was a miracle drug for me.  Before taking it I had horrid panic attacks and acute distress.  I was at my wits end.  I felt hopeless and tormented by reoccurring panic attacks and terrified thoughts and feelings.  I tried everything for anxiety, even klonipen, having nothing worked.  After taking Effexor for 2 weeks, my anxiety decreased by about 60 %, I felt happier and more in control of my life.  I went from a terrified worry wart to a content person.  I highly recommend it.  It is the best anxiety drug I ever had.  The benefits definitely out weigh the side effects.  The ones I experience is constipation, insomnia and muscle convulsions but it is worth it if you are suffering a lot from anxiety."
