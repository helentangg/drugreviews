"Cymbalta is VERY effective... and trade-off is increased appetite... lowered metabolism... so expect weight gain or plan to exercise more and reduce calorie intake. Hair loss is a strong possibility. If loss of hair doesn&#039;t concern you... it&#039;s NOT MUCH...but enough for you to notice... and it does grow back... so! All things considered... I am very happy with Cymbalta. I used to use Lexapro (about 2 yrs) and had nothing but problems... Zoloft didn&#039;t do the job for me... but as I emphasized... Cymbalta has been a blue ribbon treatment.  I don&#039;t get lightheaded, no dizziness... I recommend it."
