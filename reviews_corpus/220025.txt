"Was prescribed 25mg for post traumatic stress from a motorcycle vs. Drunk driver wreck I survived.  I also have insomnia and panic/anxiety attacks as a result.  I had negative experiences with Xanax. So started amitript 25mg did nothing for me, kept me awake, even.  50mg helped a little (5-6 hours of sleep).  I went back to the doc and he said &#039;a guy your size, try taking 2 50mg before bed&#039; (I weight 215).  I took 2 while making dinner and could barely keep my head up while eating.   I slept 10 hours straight!  This is fantastic as I have &#039;interrupted sleep cycles&#039; where my body comes out of REM sleep from the PTSD.  Doc says I need 10-12 hours of sleep on a good night.  I like that it&#039;s not addictive as well."
