"This was a god send for me as I&#039;ve tried others and nothing helped, I am currently on max dosage 120mg a day but I&#039;m still alive and that&#039;s the main thing, it doesn&#039;t at all help with my fibro I don&#039;t think but anxiety has near enough gone and depression very copable , obviously I get bad days still its not a permanent everyday fix, but be WARNED, you may gain a lot of weight over 3 + years I&#039;ve taken this and its basically stopped my metabolism, I exercise and hardly eat bad stuff but I have gained over 5 stone, so to be honest, I&#039;m thinking of stopping it for this reason only, other than that for my depression and anxiety etc its been amazing"
