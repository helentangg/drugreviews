"On Effexor for 14 years.  150 milligrams daily of the IR not the XR so I was taking 75mg 2 times per day.  In retrospect, the medicine worked for me for about a year and the other 13 were just maintenance years.  I also found since titrating from 150mg down to 9.75 mg that I feel human again.  Effexor solved zero problems for me and it simply numbed me to feeling strong emotion.  I also dropped 36 pounds since coming off of this medicine and feel a heck of a lot better.  I have been titrating since July of 2015 and my last titration to zero will be in 2 weeks.  As stated before, this stuff doesn&#039;t solve problems, it just numbs human emotion.  Me, like many other folks need to learn how to accept our emotions.  The answer isn&#039;t always a drug"
