"I take this medicine primarily for obsessive compulsive disorder, but I also have depression and general anxiety disorder that it helps with. I took it several years ago but it pooped out on me, and my psychiatrist decided to try it again about two years ago. I worked up to 80 mgs because she said that I needed a really high dosage. I take it when I wake up in the morning and find it activating. It&#039;s so weird because I find things that I realize I do now that I would&#039;ve never done before being on this medicine. It&#039;s such a good feeling each time I realize that and am reminded of how far I&#039;ve come. I love this medication and really, really hope I can stay on it this time and not have it poop out on me."
