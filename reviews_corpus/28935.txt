"I found that in high stress situations, I still had some degree of anxiety (sweaty palms, holding my breath without realizing it, some shaking, etc) but overall my ability to handle anxiety evened out.  I was a lot less stressed and found decision making, dealing with my children, and talking in front of people to be much more manageable.  I was able to sleep better without waking up several times in a panic wondering what I had forgotten to do.  I stopped worrying about things.  This drug changed my life with a moderately low dose and with little to no side effects."
