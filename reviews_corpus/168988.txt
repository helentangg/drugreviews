"This is the first antidepressant I&#039;ve been on and so far so good.  It worked rather quickly for my anxiety.  It is working more slowly for my depression, but I still feel much better.  I am currently on the 10 mg, maybe I&#039;ll go up to the 20 mg.

  I read previous reviews and have been eating lots of protein with it so the lower GI side effects have not been bad at all for me.  

Do actually follow the warning label and do not drink alcohol while on Viibryd.  I had 3 glasses of wine last night and woke up depressed and mad at my fiance without much good reason.  I had a similar experience last weekend with less alcohol and a bit less depressive/obsessive thinking but still not healthy feeling."
