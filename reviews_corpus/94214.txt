"I am only on day two. I hesitated taking this drug because the last antidepressant I took (Cymbalta). was horrible. It took me a year to get rid of the withdrawal symptoms. To this day I will still have random &quot;brain zaps&quot;. So back to the Brintellix, I was in the deepest and darkest depression of my life ever. I knew I had to do something so yesterday I took my first pill. Later that evening I was feeling much more calm and better. Today my deep depression is gone. I still have room for improvement. I would have never thought in a million years it would start to work that fast. I was very nauseous yesterday after I took it but I was nauseous before I took it.  I just took pill #2. So far I am very impressed. I will report back in the future"
