"I had such high hopes for this medication for my severe depression and anxiety. I was committed to try it for a full 4 weeks. I started on 10 mg and then went up to 15 mg. I never managed to get to the 20 mg due to overwhelming nausea, belching, excessive salivating, unbearable constipation and then the vomiting started. I didn&#039;t gain weight but that is because I couldn&#039;t eat. It did help with the depression but not the anxiety. Definitely not for me!"
