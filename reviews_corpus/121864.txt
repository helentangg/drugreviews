"I started on Effexor XR 37.5 mg 12 days ago. Prior to this I had been on Lexapro 20mg 8 weeks for extreme anxiety.  The severity of my anxiety was so shocking on Lexapro after the 8 weeks compared to the commencement of Lexapro.  I had heard so many people have success with Lexapro on review sites, but for myself it was a nightmare after 7 weeks if felt like I was in a hole.  My doc took me off immediately without even reducing the amount and within 5 days I felt so much better with a significant reduction in anxiety.  I still needed support, so my doc put me on Effexor 37.5mg and within 5 days felt much better, then went to 75mg.  After 10 days on this, I am already starting to feel better, with anxiety problems only now and then."
