"My Dr. prescribed Pristiq 50mg. after taking Cymbalta because of the terrible side effects. The only side effects Pristiq has given me is the lack of sexual desire but Trazodone 50mg. which I also take balances out that effect. I also take Tranxene7.5mg before bedtime and get at least 5 hours of straight sleep! I am doing much better."
