"This medication is excellent for anxiety ,depression, bipolar type 2 disorder and also helps with any pain that the patient my be suffering from from pain from depression and/or chronic pain. However this medication will not cure your pain if it&#039;s chronic, but it will alleviate it a lot and you wont have to take so much prescription pain killers. I&#039;m speaking from personal experience and from the experiences of others. The only problem is that this medication is very expensive especially if you don&#039;t have prescription drug insurance and there&#039;s no generic for this yet."
