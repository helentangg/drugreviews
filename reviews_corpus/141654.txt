"I have severe panic attacks and slight depression, so my doc suggested Lexapro along with Xanax for the panic attacks. I was on 5mg of Escitalopram for about 2 months and still felt stressed.  My doc increased it to 10mg which I&#039;ve been on for months now.  I thought I was doing okay until I had a severe emotional breakdown this past weekend for 3 hours straight.  My doc just increased me to 20mg so I&#039;ll check back in.  

Side effects for me starting at 5mg have been extremely VIVID and sometimes crazy dreams, decrease in sex drive and inability to have an orgasm, and slight weight gain."
