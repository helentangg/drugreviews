"I&#039;ve been on Prozac for just about 3 months. At first I did not notice a difference for about a month then I started feeling more energized for a few weeks however the weight is going on as fast as grass grows.
I&#039;m seeing my doctor today and need to switch. I&#039;ve even been working out, walking and have been more active. The weight gain is awful, at least for me."
