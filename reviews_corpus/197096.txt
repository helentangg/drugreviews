"I had a hysterectomy in 2002 and went on hormones for a few years, then quit and had no problems.  This year night sweats started really bad, waking 5-10 times a night.  This drug stopped the night sweats within 3 days, but depression, no motavation, being tired all day and being very irratable I made the decision to wean myself off after 3 weeks.  Now after 5 days off I am beginning to feel human again.  Side effects weren&#039;t worth it for me."
