"I just recently stopped smoking and have had an increase in my depression, crying, stress, feelings of being out of control and the doctor put me on Venlafaxine. I have experienced horrible side effects. Extreme dry mouth, sleeplessness, blured vision, shaking, panic and increased anxiety attacks. Side effects began about 5 hours after beginning the medication and lasted for two days after stopping."
