"I have been on Cymbalta 120mg for three years now and still feel no difference. I suffer from major depression and anxiety. It has done nothing for my illness. My psychiatrist also has me on Wellbutrin 150mg and Abilify which I guess is supposed to jump start the antidepressant but so far since being on it I have been to CPEP two times which is a mental ward at the hospital. 
 And common I read where some have felt a difrence in 48 hours or a week that is bull. 
 Finally my pdoc is going to put me on MAOI&#039;s as I have been on so many of the new antidepressants for the past 10 years &amp; nothing has worked but Cymbalta is no miracle drug."
