"I was on Lexapro for about 7 years in doses that ranged from 10 to 20 mg (I altered the dose with permission from my physician depending on my circumstances). Overall, it performed well for me and I was generally able to deal with the side effects (the greatest for me: drowsy and difficulty concentrating). About a month ago I decided that I wanted to be drug-free because I am not currently in situations that contribute to depression. I abruptly went off Lexapro (not recommended; should have tapered down) and now find myself in an unpleasant territory (volatile; irritable; impatient; headaches). Not happy with the new me so Doctor has suggested I try Celexa (10 mg). Will post a review after I give it a try. Smile!"
