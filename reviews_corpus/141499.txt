"I used Lexapro about ten years ago for a year and went back on it a couple months ago. For a couple days at the start, I felt a bit of pressure in my head--a mild squeezing sensation--but nothing too bad. Now, no side effects at all and I&#039;m feeling decidedly better. The constant feeling of dread is gone and my thinking is clearer. A wonderful help. I&#039;m not worried about going off it eventually. Last time I just tapered down. I had some vivid dreams, but that was it."
