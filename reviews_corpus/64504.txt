"I was apprehensive about trying Zoloft, but I wanted to share my experience. I started taking Zoloft 2 weeks ago primarily for major depression. When I&#039;m less depressed I also suffer from social anxiety disorder.

I took 25mg for the first 4 days, then upped to 50mg. First few days on 25mg I had moments of feeling very spaced out. When I increased the dose to 50mg, I had a few days of nausea, diarrhoea and again felt quite spaced out, but after 4 or so days this stopped. I also experienced a few waves of anxiety, but this has since disappeared.

2 weeks in, and I&#039;m feeling better. Not all the way there, but I feel more stable. Less hopeless, more in control. Calmer. I&#039;m starting to feel like myself again."
