"I&#039;m 27 years old and have been on Lexapro for about 2 1/2 years now. It has really saved my life. I fought depression and anger problems for most of my life. I tried all kinds of other medicines and nothing helped. I went through a really bad divorce about three years ago and got very depressed. I never really knew how I was treating people until I started taking Lexapro and getting better. I felt good about my life. Lexapro saved my life when I thought there was hope. I&#039;m so thankful. The only side effect I&#039;ve had is a little weight gain. I don&#039;t like the weight gain but I wouldn&#039;t give up Lexapro for anything."
