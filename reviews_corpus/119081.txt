"I am 55 years old and have been taking Zoloft over 20 years. For me it has been a miracle medicine. I find I am much more on an even keel and while some things still upset me, it&#039;s far less than without Zoloft. I find too I am much more rational in my thought processes and am more confident of choices I make. I have several medical conditions that contribute to feeling depressed, overwhelmed, and yes, even suicidal but since I began my therapy with Zoloft, I want to live. Without Zoloft, I did not.  I encourage anyone who feels depressed to seek help by finding the right medication for you. Life is hard enough without having to cope with feelings of severe negative emotions. I am so grateful for whoever created Zoloft."
