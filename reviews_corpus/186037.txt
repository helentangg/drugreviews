"Hello all,

I was prescribed Pristiq (50mg) for Major Depressive Disorder and severe OCD. Before going on the meds about 12weeks ago I read a lot of online forums and was terrified after reading innumerable horrible reviews! I have to say that this medication has changed my life, I feel normal again; I have energy, I am happy, I am motivated and my relationship has improved drastically!
Everyone reacts differently to medications but do not be scared to try it based on the reviews you see. I experienced moderate side effects for the first 4 weeks; drowsiness (really strong in the first week), nausea, insomnia and headaches. I never experienced the &#039;brain zaps&#039; and most side effects went away after week 4."
