"I have been on Pristiq for at least six years for post-menopausal anxiety/depression.  I tried several other medications without success, but this one is great.  No side effects other than headache and mild nausea the first couple days.  I feel &quot;normal&quot; 99% of the time - moods have evened out, almost no anxiety/irritability and have an overall happy feeling.  I would take it in the morning, as it can cause mild insomnia.  I will stay with this one."
