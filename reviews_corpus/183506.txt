"I was on Cymbalta for about 3 months.  I can&#039;t say that it really did a whole lot for me during that time.  I think it may have made me feel a little more energized but I vaguely remember feeling anxious and jittery along with that.  The most profound effect that this medicine did have on me was my bowels.  For some reason it gave me the worst smelling flatulence of my life.  It was literally unbearable and is the main reason that I got off of it.  Once I got off, the flatulence went away and my bowels went back to normal."
