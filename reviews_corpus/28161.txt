"This is the first time I have ever posted a review of anything online, but I feel an obligation to share my experience to other suffering with anxiety. I suffer from GAD which included panic attacks, muscle aches, and a horrible temper.  I avoided this medication fearing weight gain (as I already gained 10 lbs over the year) and sexual dysfunction.  When I explained this to my doctor, he replied &quot;Have you ever considered whether being anxious has caused you to eat more, drink more, and maybe have sex less often?&quot;. I have been on Lexapro for 6 months now, and my only regret is not starting this treatment sooner. I have lost 15 lbs as I don&#039;t eat and drink as much anymore, and my love life has improved. Anxiety sucks. You don&#039;t have to suffer!"
