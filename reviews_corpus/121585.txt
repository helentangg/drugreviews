"I&#039;m currently 18 years old, 8 months ago I had to leave my college due to alcoholism. I started drinking around a year ago because I found out my grandfather had a 30 year affair with a different woman whilst he was working away. He had kids with her and it devastated me as I never knew my father and always looked up to him because he was the only male role model I had. I&#039;ve been on numerous anti-depressants since that time and this is the only one that allows me to leave the house and experience the beauty of life. I&#039;m moving away from my hometown next month with my mother to a bigger place with lots of supportive relatives. I&#039;m looking forward to a new environment and returning to college to resume studies. I&#039;m now off alcohol."
