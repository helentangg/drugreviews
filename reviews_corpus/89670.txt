"I have been on Celexa for five months.  Started at 20mg.  After three weeks, my anxiety went away.  I was no longer hesitant to leave my house, or afraid to make a simple phone call or check my email.  (I used to have to prepare myself mentally for an hour just to go to the grocery store, because the thought of getting dressed, stepping outside, driving the car, parking, etc., would overwhelm me.)  For a while I felt so good, better than ever.  I was free!  I felt &quot;normal.&quot;  When I needed to go to the grocery store, I hopped in the car and did it with little thought or fear.  Felt great! But alas, five months later, now on 40MG, my anxiety is coming back, good times are over."
