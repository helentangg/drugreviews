"I had taken Zoloft for a year now and it did work wonders for my mood.  However I did have some side effects. Loss of sex drive and very vivid and disturbing dreams. So much so I have decided to try something else. My doctor has put me on Viibryd but I am experiencing too many side effects on that too. Hopefully I can find something that works for me."
