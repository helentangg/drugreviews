"First, let me start off by saying that I did not know which category to choose, as this medication has helped me with several (OCD, PTSD, panic disorder, antenatal depression, claustrophobia, agoraphobia, social anxiety, and GAD.) For years, I debated and even fought the idea of taking medicine. After many years of struggling from a host of debilitating mental illnesses, I vowed if I was brave enough to try SSRI&#039;s, that I would come back and write about my experience in hopes that this post could at help at least one individual. At first, my antenatal depression and anxiety got so much worse, and I pretty much experienced every side effect in the book (yes, even the scary ones). I cannot even believe how amazing I feel just 8 weeks later!"
