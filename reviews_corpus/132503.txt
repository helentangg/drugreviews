"I have had chronic insomnia for 5 years.  I struggle to fall asleep, and once I&#039;m asleep, I never sleep longer than 45 minutes - 1 hour without waking up.  I take Ambien when I can afford it, so I have to limit myself to only a few times a week. I was given a sample pack of Silenor about a year ago, but the online reviews made me not want to try it.  I was desperate last night, so I tried one 3mg. My heart raced and it did not make me sleepy. I took another half 3mg. and finally dozed off about an hour later. The amazing thing is that even though I never felt sleepy from it like I do with Ambien,  I actually slept for 3 straight hours on the Silenor.  I do have a tiny headache today, so I don&#039;t know if I will take it again."
