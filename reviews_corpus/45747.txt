"This is my fourth day on Prozac. I have been extremely hyper/manic in the morning, but by night time I&#039;m exhausted from all the bouncing around that it helps me sleep better. I talk a lot more and a lot faster. I talk to strangers on the street, say hi to people, which is very unlike me because I&#039;m normally shy and reserved. I felt different the first day I took it. I wouldn&#039;t say I&#039;m &quot;happy&quot;, just not sad. I&#039;ve tried to think about sad things that used to bother me but I feel neutral now. Today particularly I started to feel a little down. They say with every high comes a low, so I&#039;m assuming it&#039;s crash time with this medication. But I&#039;m hoping it will even out in the next few weeks, which is when you&#039;re supposed to feel it&#039;s full benefits."
