"I entered the beginning stages of menopause and my mood changed dramatically.  I was getting very concerned as I had never felt so sad and hopeless.  I could not stop crying and things that  normally I would not let bother me were becoming huge issues.  I did not recognize myself.  I am known as glass half full kind of person so the change was dramatic.  I was put on 35mg of Effexor and wow - what a difference.  Surprise, surprise my hot flashes stopped, ( I have since read it helps with that)  mood back to normal and strangely my joints don&#039;t hurt so much and I have more energy.  The few negatives are I yawn a lot and though I still enjoy sex I can not have an orgasm.  I consider both minor due to feeling so much better."
