"I&#039;ve been on Pristiq for 2 weeks. I was on Effexor for 7 years after having my son. I always had anxiety and worry too much. After having my son I didn&#039;t know why I was panicking etc., all the time so they put me on 75mg on Effexor. It did good for me but I thought I&#039;d stop. I stopped for 10 months and tried natural path which seemed to be okay but not the full strength. When my cat had to be put down almost a month ago I was a mess and still am. I begged my doctor to put me on something. I realize I need meds the most when something major has happened) so they said how about try Pristiq...LOVE IT. It makes me quite relaxed feeling for a few hours after I take it at lunch. My sex drive is SUPER HIGH."
