"I&#039;m extremely sensitive to the side effects of these medicines. Remeron is the only one I can tolerate (and it doesn&#039;t give me enough relief by itself). Brintellix&#039;s side effects reminded me of Pristiq&#039;s--falling asleep during the day, not able to sleep at night but it worked on my Interstitial Cystitis and it reduced my appetite, so I&#039;m going to give it a longer trial in the summer when school is out and I&#039;m not working."
