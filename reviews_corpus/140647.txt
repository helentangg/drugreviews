"Just passed week four marker on 10 mg, and am experiencing subtle but positive changes. The first week and one half was a bit disconcerting, as the heart palpitations I had increased, and my anxieties seemed to be amplified. I also developed a headache that nothing could touch, that lasted about four days. Thereafter things calmed and about week three I began to notice periods of time when I became more mellow, and my interactions with those around me seem more positive than before. Now that mellowness has expanded somewhat, though it is not consistent, nor do I feel any haziness or loss of focus when needed. No weight gain, no sexual side effects."
