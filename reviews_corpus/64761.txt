"I&#039;ve been sort of depressed or slightly anxious always. Started 50 mg sertraline daily 6 years ago. Great from the start, the only negative effects I ever experienced were from not taking it sometimes. It leveled out a few years ago and it probably needs to be upped by 25 mg daily. It has worked many wonders for me but I need to really chill out a little bit more, maybe this will do it."
