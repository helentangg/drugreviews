"This medication did amazing things for me after being diagnosed with an anxiety disorder.  I suffered panic attacks, inability to control my emotions, crying to bouts of anger along with other symptoms.  Within 2 weeks there was a huge change. I am now laughing and joking again, I have no mood swings, no more crying, I have no anger issues now, just incredible.  I did suffer side effects for the first 17 days and was very nauseous. First few days are the worst and then it eases off, some minor headaches, a small amount of fever, a little more sweating, some dizziness, but overall it was worth it.  Back to a happy go lucky girl."
