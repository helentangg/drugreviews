"Never before had serious side effects.  Never posted an internet comment. Continued side effects including constant nausea, constipation, erratic blood pressure, balance/dizzy problem  poor sleep, erratic heat beat. The first time I was dizzy and kept walking, then I fainted. Subsequent dizzy spells resulted in bed or couch as I couldn&#039;t walk for 4 hours. I ceased this medicine after 12 days and yet it took a month to completely recover."
