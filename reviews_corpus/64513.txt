"Started at 25 for about two weeks, then went to 50. Each dosage change brought back a few symptoms, but all are gone in a few days. Zoloft helped me a lot, I had never taken an anti depressant before so I was nervous. My intrusive thoughts are gone one month later!! Don&#039;t read to much into this page, it caused me to have anxiety/panic attacks. My biggest problem was swallowing, but that was due to anxiety, I didn&#039;t want to take the anxiety Meds on top of zoloft, so I just waited the attacks out, last max two hours. Just know to gradually increase your dosage and to check in with prescribing person when you have concerns.  Side effects: nausea, fatigue, loose stools, blurry vision in morning, breast felt numb (gone now), dry mouth (gum!!)."
