"I&#039;ve been on Pristiq now for 4 months and it has changed my life for the better. Pristiq needs time to work though. During the first few weeks I had no desire to eat anything. Then after the 3rd week I got my appetite back. I&#039;ve went from 150 pounds 3 months ago to 170 today. Back to where I was. I&#039;ve gotten energy back whilst on Pristiq and my desire to do things has returned. To those who are optimistic about Pristiq I recommend that you give it a chance."
