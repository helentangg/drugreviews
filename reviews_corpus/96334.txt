"I started on 50mg and I took it for about 2 months then I missed a week due to vacation and forgetting to bring them with me.  Now I&#039;m achy all the time, very dizzy, feel sick after eating anything no matter how mild, my back is the most achy.  I think its my body trying to get used to the drug again but I didn&#039;t feel this way the first time I started.  I don&#039;t really know what is going on but I&#039;m tired all the time and that is definitely not helping the depression."
