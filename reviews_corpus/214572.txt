"I&#039;ve had anxiety as long as I can remember. Symptoms like insomnia, eating issues, tons of intense fear around bizarre and unlikely life-threatening situations happening to me. I&#039;ve also struggled with uncontrollable panic attacks during stressful times. I&#039;m now a junior in college, and after a spell of depression (caused by panic attacks and constant anxiety), I decided to try medication (though, of course, taking meds made me anxious. Ha). 
I&#039;ve now been on Lexapro for about 7 weeks, and I am very happy I chose to try it. I&#039;m on 10mg, and the first week was miserable. Like everyone says, stick it out. Now, my outlook is much more positive, and I am way less anxious. Give it a shot! I&#039;m thankful I did."
