"I&#039;ve been taking Lexapro since August now. Started on a low dose (5mg) because I don&#039;t tolerate the side effects of antidepressants well. 

First few weeks of taking this wasn&#039;t the most pleasant experience but I soon got use to it and it wasn&#039;t so bad. 

I struggle with GAD and depression and while it hasn&#039;t cured my anxiety I am already feeling some better. I have since moved up to 20 mg. 

The list of side effects that I had most trouble with were; 
Drowsiness throughout the day, jitters, bruxism(clenching my teeth) and an increase of anxiety. I also noticed that I felt like I had the flu because of body aches. Made my eyes glossy as well."
