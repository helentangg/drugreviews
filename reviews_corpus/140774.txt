"I have only been on this medication (5mg) for a few days.  If it were not for the reviews I would feel like I am losing my mind.  So far I&#039;ve been nauseous, moody, and yawning alot.  Although there are headaches they are not as frequent, however I have been experiencing diarrhea several times of day, loss of appetite, and fatigue.  I was really struggling with anxiety and hesitant to try these pills, but will continue to hang in there for now.  I hope they work.  Thanks for sharing your experiences."
