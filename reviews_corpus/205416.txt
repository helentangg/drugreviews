"I&#039;ve been taking Pristiq for one week. My extreme sensitivity to Meds of this type has been long proven. Knowing me well and willing to work with me my Dr has me on 25 mg Pristiq in the morning with food every other day. I&#039;ve had ups and downs this first week but am trying to stay positive. I have moments of feeling well and hope they continue to expand. I hope I don&#039;t have issues with every other day dosing causing withdrawal in between doses. I also have discovered that drinking coffee with Pristiq heightens my anxiety."
