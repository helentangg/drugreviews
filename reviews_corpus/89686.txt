"I&#039;ve been taking Celexa for almost a year now and it&#039;s been wonderfully helpful.  I&#039;ve had depression/anxiety on and off for years (as well as hypothyroidism).  However, I was always hesitant to take any medication that I didn&#039;t feel was &quot;absolutely necessary&quot;, so I never took anti-depressants before trying Celexa.  Initially, I started with 20 mg and that worked well for a couple of months, but then I needed to go up to 40mg and that has been the dosage that works consistently for me.  Other than the first few weeks of treatment, I&#039;ve had NO bad side effects whatsoever. It has really increased my sex drive (which has been non-existent for years).  "
