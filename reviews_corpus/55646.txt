"I have been on this medication for at least a year and a half. I started out with Celexa which at the highest dose completely stopped working for me, I was in a panic, cry for help. I became so much more depressed and my behaviors were so impulsive. My Dr started me of Effexor and what a difference this medication has made in my life. My mood became stable, I am no longer angry at the world, and l don&#039;t have the desire to go back to the way I was before Effexor. 
Remember everyone, we are all individualized, some things may with for others better than ourselves!"
