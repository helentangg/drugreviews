"I am on prozac for 5 weeks now, no relapse of binge ever since. But i have experienced some side effects like lack of energy, insomnia, nausea, and dry mouth. Some of them went away. Hope within time all of them go away. I will recommend it to people who suffer from binge eating. It noticeably reduced my appetite from the third day. My obssession over food can finally be stopped. I am really happy with this medication. Started at 20 mg in 1st week, upped to 40 mg in 2nd, then 60 mg in 3rd."
