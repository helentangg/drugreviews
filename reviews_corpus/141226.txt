"Stress from Major life changes left me with nasty panic attacks that lead to an anxiety disorder for over a year. You name the symptom it I had it.Until you lived with an anxiety disorder you have NO idea how crippling these symptoms could be. My doctor immediately put me on Lexapro when I told her how I was feeling. I took it for 3 days and felt out of my mind. I was paralyzed with fear... I went off it and tried celexa and prozac. After these 2 drugs didn&#039;t work I gave lexapro another try. YES the side effects are horrible but they GO AWAY.  I feel so much better and I&#039;m getting control back slowly but SURELY!!"
