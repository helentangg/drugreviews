"I was prescribed this drug for major depression and C-PTSD. I only took it for one week, 5mg. It was awful. I was exhausted all of the time, had trouble falling asleep and my sleep was disturbed by very vivid and bizarre dreams. I woke up every morning shaking, dizzy and disoriented. During the day my legs hurt so bad it made walking difficult. It made me so hungry, craving carbs, I gained 9lbs of belly fat in one week! It left me with zero motivation and unable to feel any joy, excitement, pleasure. I felt detached, empty, I felt dead. I stopped taking it and while i&#039;m still struggling with depression I do feel like me again, I feel alive and have lost all of the weight gained while taking it."
