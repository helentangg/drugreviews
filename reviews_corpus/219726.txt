"I have been taking 20mg at night for a couple of years and can&#039;t praise it highly enough. I had terrible muscle cramps and twitching and constant burning pain in my arms and legs, within a few days of starting the drug, my symptoms began to ease. The twitching is now only very mild, the pain is  2 out of 10 and the spasms non existent! Magic."
