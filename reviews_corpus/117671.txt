"Have had GAD (Anxiety, sometime severe) on and off for about 12 years.  I&#039;m a 58 year old Male in excellent health, otherwise.  

Nortriptyline was the 7th Med prescribed (after Lexapro, Beta Blockers, Zoloft, etc.) and for me it was radically better than all the other Meds.  Tried to take at night but was too activating.  

Started taking 10 mg in the AM and another 10 mg in the afternoon (if needed).  Completely controlled my Anxiety, gave me more energy, improved sex drive, and cleared-up both Acne &amp; Rosacea.  EXCELLENT Drug...worth a try.

Due to the low dose, I had none of the typical side effects (dry mouth, etc.)"
