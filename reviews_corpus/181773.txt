"I was put on Mirtazapine by my doctor recently and the side effects of it were horrendous. Slept for hours on end, when I did get up I was living through a fog. I couldn&#039;t function on a day to day basis. The nightmares were awful, vivid very scary dreams that I couldn&#039;t force myself to wake from so I decided enough. I had been on citalopram before that and it was no longer helping so I was switched to the mirtazapine. I went back on Prozac and in less than a week I feel better, my head is clear and I can do things I enjoy. I don&#039;t sleep well anyway so the Prozac has no effect on that. I will stick with the Prozac."
