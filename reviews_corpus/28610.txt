"Lexapro has helped me in a lot of ways. Maybe because I paired it with a mood stabilizer... I don&#039;t know. I feel numb a lot of the time but I have found that I am more calm and respond better than I used to, in certain situations I couldn&#039;t face before. It has also controlled my appetite and I don&#039;t feel like stuffing my face, all the time, like I used to. My only complaint, it makes it hard to sleep, sometimes, and I am very addicted to it. If I go over 24 hours without taking it, my skin starts to crawl and my mind starts to race. 


But, hey, being on Lexapro is the only thing that works for my bipolar disorder. And those who have bipolar disorder, like me, know what living with it is like. Pretty awful."
