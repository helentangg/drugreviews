"Took about a month to kick in but man it&#039;s been awesome. I tried several other things like Wellbutrin, Prozac and Cymbalta and they all either did absolutely nothing or made me feel worse. 
Was on Paxil for years and it worked great originally then stopped working all together. Wish I had been on Pristiq years ago. One of the best things about it is the energy it gives me. It definitely is mood lifting. Before Pristiq I couldn&#039;t wake up in he morning..now I pop up out of bed at 5am ready to go everyday..even on the weekend!"
