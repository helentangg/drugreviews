"Helped with depressive thoughts and episodes quite a bit, I was in a toxic environment at work and home, which were one in the same. Started at 10mg for 4 weeks, which helped a little with my symptoms of &#039;negative meditation&#039; where I could only think of mistakes I made and how I couldn&#039;t concentrate at work. Went from functioning 30% to 70%. Increased to 20mg even though I hesitated because I was experiencing some unpleasant side effects. They indeed worsened on 20mg to my un-surprise. I had low sex drive before because of the depression, but my desire is gone now because of the medication. Starting to feel numb, and there&#039;s something inside me that won&#039;t relax. I quit my job and moved, too. Still have some anxiety."
