"It absolutely worked for me!  I was really suffering with hot flushes - really badly - had to get up in the middle of the night and lie next to a fan and a cold hairdryer - didn&#039;t really want to go on HRT but my doctor wouldn&#039;t do that anyway because I was trying to get my high blood pressure under control - anyway she suggested I try taking fluoxetine 20mg a day as she had had good results with some other patients really suffering with hot flushes - IT WORKS IT WORKS!  After about 2 weeks I was a different person and 6 months later I am totally clear of the awful hot flushes!   Very happy lady!"
