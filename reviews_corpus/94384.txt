"I&#039;ve been on 10mg Brintellix for a week now. The first day I took it within 30 minutes I was sick. Which I could afford to lose a few pounds so I guess I won&#039;t complain about that. I&#039;ve been extremely tired since taking this medicine. However my mood does seem brighter while I&#039;m awake. I also take Trileptol, Tramadol, Norco, gabapentin, and two inhalers. I&#039;m 33 and have some health issues and so far the medicine seems to be helping. I just hope it stays this way. Good luck to everyone."
