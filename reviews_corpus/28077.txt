"I feel like I have my life back with Lexapro. I am not depressed anymore. No more racing negative thoughts. On the down side, it did give me acne and my have difficulty with my memory and finding the words I want to say. It makes me feel like I have a little dementia, but I am afraid to go off of it and have depression again."
