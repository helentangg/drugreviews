"Im a 20 year old female, been on Celexa for about 4 days now. I was pretty skeptical reading all the reviews and some negative ones really scared me, but I decided to take it anyway. So far I am liking the medicine. Little side effects such as a mild headache that seems to come about 5 min. after I take the pill, drowsiness (which is why I take it at night) and a tiny but of nausea. Nothing to major like I thought. Oh! and also no panic attacks, which is one of the main reasons I started taking this. Celexa has given me a sort of &quot;calm, relaxed&quot; feel. But I also feel more uplifted. I&#039;m not sure the right word. I&#039;m not energetic but I feel energized, which is great. I would recommend trying this if you suffer from frequent panic and worry."
