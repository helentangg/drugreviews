"My anxiety peaked 6 years ago.  Not only did I dread social interaction of any kind (talking to co-workers, going out with friends, even being around my own family) but I had experienced a panic attack on the freeway which kept me from driving anywhere far from my home for two years.  I was extremely stubborn and didn&#039;t want chemicals to &quot;change&quot; my reality.  I finally had to admit to myself that my reality sucked - bad. I&#039;m overjoyed to report that Lexapro saved me.  It took a month for me to realize I was greeting people in passing again.  I drive on the freeway again and love being around people.  Stick with it even if you feel &quot;weird&quot; at first.  You CAN have your life back!  I take it at night, the initial drowsiness helps me sleep."
