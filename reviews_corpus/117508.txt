"I titrated up over two months, 10 mg at a time until I reached 50 mg.  The side effects for me were:  bad dreams, increased appetite, tiredness, heartburn, decreased sex drive, and sadness.  I began taking the medicine at 7 PM and that eliminated the bad dreams.  However, the medicine made me feel depressed.  I would feel sad and start crying for no reason.  This was all in the first 2 months and then the side effects went away.  I have been at 50 mg for almost 3 months now and I feel normal!  While it was hard for me in the first few months, I stuck with it and sure enough the side effects went away.  

Unfortunately, I&rsquo;ve been getting more migraines recently, and so I&rsquo;m instructed to titrate up to 90 mg...  So I&#039;m not sure if it works yet"
