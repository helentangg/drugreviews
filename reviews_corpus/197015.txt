"I used this medication for a solid 10 years, and it effectively dealt with my anxiety and depression; however, it made me very tired and I required a great deal more sleep than other people I knew. Weight gain and sexual side effects abounded, but I felt so good mentally that I was able to ignore this for a long time. This cut my obsessive thoughts out completely. I decided to wean off when I was trying to lose weight for my health and it just wasn&#039;t coming off. The weaning is a b*tch, and I weaned over several months&#039; time, using liquid fluoxetine to come down incrementally. However, once I was entirely off the medication, my anxiety and depression came back with a vengeance."
