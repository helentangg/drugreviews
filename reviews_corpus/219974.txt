"This can be a life-changer. I&#039;m 22 and had gotten a concussion back in Nov. I was in bed every day for over 2 months, told to avoid ALL stimulation, lost a few lbs, hit with multiple migraines per day. My doc prescribed amitriptyline &amp; within a few days of starting, I was easing back out of the dark and into the light (metaphorically and literally).This med gave me my life back and now I&#039;m able to graduate on-time which was threatened then. Sympt: little more constipation than my usual, dry mouth, a dampened libido... they&#039;re all not bad sacrifices for me. Also, I&#039;ve been aura-migraine-free since this medicine too! My aunt has been on it for almost 30 yrs and it&#039;s helped her chronic migraines as well. She&#039;s about 55 I think. Consider it!!!"
