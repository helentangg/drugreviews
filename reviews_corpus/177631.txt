"I&#039;ve been on this SNRI for about 3 months and have been pleased. I was on Lexapro and then stepped up for something that would address pain issues as well. I lost all the weight I gained on Lexapro, 40lbs! I&#039;d say I&#039;ve had maybe a 15-20% reduction in back pain and hip pain. The sex drive has also ramped up and I have more energy. Hey, I&#039;ll take it. 

I have heard about issues with coming off the medication. However this is true of many psychiatric medications and pain medications, this med is both so it only makes sense that stopping suddenly isn&#039;t advisable. If you can&#039;t afford your prescription you can get a few days emergency supply from your pharmacy. Also check the manufacturer website for coupons."
