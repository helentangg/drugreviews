"I was placed on Cymbalta for chronic pain as a result from injuries sustained in a head on car accident right before my 19th birthday that also caused 2 very rare recessive gene&#039;s to activate (hemiplegic migraines (neurological migraines) and Raynauds disease (circulation disorder) in my lower leg&#039;s and feet). At first the pain control was unbelievable. However, 2-3 months into my treatment I began having psychological repercussions where I felt like all my emotions were trapped inside my head. Although I felt angry, sad, happy, etc, I was unable to exhibit those emotions. Cymbalta was discontinued. My head injury was suspected to be the issue as to why I had the adverse reactions I did because my brain didn&#039;t function or process normally."
