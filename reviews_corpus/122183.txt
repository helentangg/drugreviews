"I am 26 years old and I have been on Effexor for anxiety.  When first starting the medication I had severe nausea for about 2 weeks but I stuck with it.  Thankfully the nausea went away and now I feel so much better. I feel smarter, more grounded and able to make appropriate decisions.  Before going on Effexor it was like I was always working hyper vigilantly to ensure nothing bad happened.  Now I am able to relax and go with the flow.  The only draw back is the severe withdrawal symptoms of dizziness and &quot;brain jolts.&quot; I notice these beginning even if I am just a hour late taking my pill."
