"Second worst psych med I have ever taken, and I have taken 20  psych meds. First off it&#039;s caused an insane amount of horrible side effects. I feel like I am living a fog all the time and feel like I&#039;m literally going insane. It&#039;s caused chronic muscle ache (I had no pain problems before taking this med) The only thing worse than dealing with being on this med is dealing with the miserable extremely long withdrawal of trying to get off of it. I have tried numerous times to get off of it using a slow weaning process, but it&#039;s just so difficult to get off of. I can truly say I wish I had never started this med, and there a much better meds out there for all conditions, that won&#039;t ruin your life."
