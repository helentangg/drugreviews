"This medication is definitely not for me. I suffer from social anxiety and panic attacks. I took 10 mg daily for 2 weeks. Although while on this medication, I did not have my panic attacks; I still had social anxiety. I was completely emotionless, couldn&#039;t stay sleeping, and never had an orgasm; the total zombie affect. It gave me headaches every morning and jaw pain-I guess a withdrawal side effect. I would not recommend to anyone unless you are coming off of some hard drugs. Every addictive! Severe side effects!"
