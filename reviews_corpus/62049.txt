"Celexa has helped to improve my mental status but the physical symptoms/side effects are another story. In the month I&#039;ve been taking it I&#039;ve had headaches, nausea/upset stomach, extreme fatigue, some insomnia, diminished appetite and more. I&#039;m going to see my doctor tomorrow to get off of this medication."
