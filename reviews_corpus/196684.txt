"I started taking Paxil 20mg a few days ago.  I just started a new semester at uni &amp; got a new job &amp; I don&#039;t handle stress well at all.  I am petrified of social situations and I&#039;m always &#039;nervy&#039; &amp; everything bothers me...literally everything!  Very easily annoyed &amp; very easily stressed out, which is all part of anxiety.  Anyways, this medicine has worked wonders for me so far.  I can actually walk through the halls at uni without feeling the terror.  No panic attacks or flu-like symptoms afterwards anymore. So far, I&#039;ve lost my appetite &amp; have trouble sleeping, but nothing I can&#039;t handle.  I wouldn&#039;t say I feel like a zombie, but I feel relaxed and slightly tired.I&#039;m taking metabolism supporting vitamins hoping it prevents weight gain"
