"I have suffered from depression for over 10 years,  I got to the point of almost not existing any more. Thankfully I managed to claw my way through it and seek help, as soon as I did that I received an overwhelming amount of support, completely disproving my precious idea of being worthless. My doctor gave me 20 mg of citalopram and that helped immensely. I have been on them now for about 7 weeks. I noticed results instantly (to my surprise), I did experience a few side effects such as nausea,  headaches and slight difficulty sleeping for the first week and I did notice a reduction in my sexdrive. However. After a few weeks I didn&#039;t experience them any more, I feel like a changed man, medication mixed with therapy. Good stuff."
