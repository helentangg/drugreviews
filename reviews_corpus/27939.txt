"I&#039;m a 40yo old male who started Lexapro just over three weeks ago for GAD. The psychiatrist advised 5mg for the first 2 weeks to adjust to side effects, then to 10mg. The first 2 weeks I barely noticed any effect, maybe a little less stressed than usual, but then moving up to 10mg really hit me hard - fatigue, sweats, confusion, nausea, panic attacks. Honestly, 5 days in I was at the point of calling my doctor to say I couldn&#039;t take it anymore. But then on day 6, I woke up feeling a whole lot better. It&#039;s hard to describe but I just feel focused and relaxed in a way that I&#039;d forgotten how, or maybe never knew. I&#039;m now on day 8 at 10mg and am so glad I stuck with it. Talk to you Dr if you&#039;re feeling terrible but know it can get better."
