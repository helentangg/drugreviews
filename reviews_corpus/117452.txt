"Been using this drug for 2 years .I used to have bad pain in lower back and numbness in my legs due to nerve damage .started with 30mg now only take 10 mg .it works for me virtually pain free .do have dry mouth and sometimes have bad dreams but I can manage that as I can walk without pain and still go to work."
