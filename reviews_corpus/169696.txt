"I have been on this just a week, 20mg a night to sleep. Immediately I noticed a loss of hunger (I have to remind myself to eat) and loss of need to urinate (again, have to remind myself or I do not feel a need). It helped with sleep the first few nights, now I am up several times each hour. It did help improve mood, but is failing at the main reason for taking it, insomnia."
