"Used it for a month started at 10 mg-20 mg. One of the worst drugs I have used. It left me so sedated that I couldn&#039;t wake up in the morning and wanted to sleep all day. It helped with head aches but I couldn&#039;t concentrate, felt overly emotional, crying and angry. I found it hard to drive from lack of focus 18 hours after taking pill. I had a deep sleep, but not a restful one, the dreams were bizarre. Dry mouth and irritable too. Not worth not having a headache to have all of these problems. I am very sensitive to medication as I don&#039;t drink so it was not for me. Oh and I gained three pounds in first two weeks using it."
