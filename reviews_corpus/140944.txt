"I have been taking Lexapro since May of 2014 for OCD and mild depression. It has helped me leaps and bounds! I was able to get my moods level again and regain control over my life. Started out taking 20mg but have been down to 10mg for about a year. Currently tapering off. 

The one downside, the only reason I can&#039;t give it a rating of 10, is because I&#039;ve gained 25lbs while taking it. I am/have always been very active and eat primarily healthy, yet continued to gain weight. No matter how active or strictly I stuck to a meal plan, the weight would not budge. But it was still worth it to get me out of the dark place I was in."
