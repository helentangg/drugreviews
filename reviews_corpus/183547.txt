"I have been taking this medicine for 1.5 years, and it has been a life changer. I have generalized anxiety and fibromyalgia, both of which affected my daily life. I began noticing mood changes immediately, and the pain subsided within a month or so. I am myself again, relaxed, level headed, and able to cope with everyday stress. The only side effect I have experienced was extreme night sweats. This has subsided, as most of Cymbalta&#039;s side effects do. I ask if you are questioning whether or not to stay on the Cymbalta or to wait it out, because the side effects fade and the positive effects increase."
