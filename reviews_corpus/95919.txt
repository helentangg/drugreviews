"I suffered from severe driving anxiety. Got to the point that I had to get my wife to do all the highway driving. Symptoms were lightheadedness, imbalanced, heart palpitations. I started Sertraline 4 weeks ago (50Mg). I have noticed a remarkable improvement. Back to doing all the highway driving, passing trucks able to stay in the fast lane with lots of traffic. One side effect however is daily diarrhea. Follow up this week with my doctor."
