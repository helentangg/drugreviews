"Just started taking Trintellix 4 days ago. No nausea, I have had headaches but that&#039;s kinda a common thing for me, so not sure its the med. But my whole reason for getting on here was to see what people had to say about any side effects of dreams. Many dreams all in one night, and none of them are good. I stopped taking VYBRID because of insomnia. Now with this medicine So far its crazy dreams. I&#039;m hoping this is only temporary. No changes in my anxiety and depression yet.....so I guess I will wait and see as usual."
