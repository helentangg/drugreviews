"I had lost interest in most areas of my life, lived in a constant state of anxiety and fear, and had become underweight.  I struggled to get the right dosage of Celexa, took about 2 months to get it right. But now, almost a year later, I am a different person.  I have started having fun again, almost nothing sets me into panic mode, and have become a healthy weight again since I regained my appetite."
