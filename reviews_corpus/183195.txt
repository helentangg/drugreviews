"This medecine delivers as promised as far as pain relief. I noticed a reduction in pain 3 days into taking it. The only pain it doesnt eliminate is my lower back pain. It even helps with my migraines! Negatives are the side effects when getting used to the med (nausea, fatigue) and the fact that your body gets used to it so you have to keep upping the dosage. Recommend starting out on the lowest dosage possible."
