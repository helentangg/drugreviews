"I had a car accident two years ago and the back, neck and leg pain crippled me untill I tried nortriptyline. I am pain free and take 50mg which I build up too. After 6 weeks the only down side is I cannot drink alcohol but a small price to pay and if I try to reduce them I go back to the same conditions I had before taking them.  I take it at night and actually sleep for 6 hours straight pain free which I could not do before.  This medicine has given me back my life."
