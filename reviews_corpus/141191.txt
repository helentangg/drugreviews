"I was hospitalized on November 26, 2014 for Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Major Depressive Disorder. I honestly thought my life had come to an end. They gave me Lexapro 20mg. It took 2-3 months for me to really feel the effects of the drug, but it works. As far as levels of anxiety is concerned, I am very doubtful the level of anxiety I had is one easily surpassed. It was nonstop, 24/7, perpetual burning sensation in my chest, ears, and extremities which had no underlying physiological cause. For anyone who is suffering from severe depression and anxiety who think there is no where left to turn, I URGE you to try this drug. Escitalopram may SAVE your life."
