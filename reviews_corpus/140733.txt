"I waited way too long to get treated for Anxiety &amp; Depression. I wish I would have sought medical help sooner.

After 20 years of battling with both A/D and moving and living as if I were in slow motion, I finally went on an SSRI. Before the Escitalopram, i was constantly irritable, jumpy, quick to anger, and downright raging at times. I took a lot of my bad moods out on my kids and husband and I feel horrible.

I am calm now. Things that normally would upset me and set me off, don&#039;t even bother me now.

I can function normally and not like a crazy person.

I started out with 10mg and was increased to 20mg. Some sexual side effects, but I will take it ANY DAY over what I was living with."
