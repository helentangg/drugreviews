"I just started Cymbalta 5 days ago for chronic neck pain as well as depression. The first few days were hell, I will admit that. I have had every side effect- nausea, dry mouth, constipation, extreme fatigue. But now at day 5, everything is starting to wear off and my neck honestly feels so much better and it&#039;s only been a few days. The only thing that seems to be sticking around is restlessness at night. I can fall asleep fine, but I wake up at around 3 am and can&#039;t get back to sleep. But I&#039;m sure my body will adjust. I would suggest sticking with Cymbalta and pushing through the side effects if you can. This is supposed to be a great med."
