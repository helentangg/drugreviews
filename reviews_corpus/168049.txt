"This drug took an awfully long time to work. I hadn&#039;t been able to notice its subtle effects until about 2 months into treatment. It does lift your mood up by a tiny fraction, is great for general anxiety and it sparks up your motivation a bit. I had been on this medication alone for no avail, but when I paired it with an SSRI (Zoloft), it made a huge difference. I recommend this combination for treatment of depression."
