"Entire time on this medication is a bit of a blur.  
Has left me with a sun sensitivity whereas I am unable to go out in strong sunlight.  If I do, my skin blisters, weeps and goes crusty.  The itching is horrendous.  Even though I have not taken this medication for over 7 years, the condition of sunsensitivity remains.  I was an outdoors person - this has turned my life upside down and prevents me doing the one thing that makes me feel better.  I have never been so angry. I don&#039;t know whether this medication kept me down or saw me through, as I was still totally depressed the entire time I was taking them, and felt blunted.  I did not realize how bad my behaviour had been affected by the pills until some time after I had quit."
