"I&#039;m 18 and on my third day of celexa, I&#039;ve had depression 3+ years now and have gone unmedicated. I finally agreed to try celexa 30MG  and .25MG of xanax. Changing my life and cannot wait for even more improvement. Only issues so far is some insomnia and CONSTANT yawning but it&#039;s a small price to pay!"
