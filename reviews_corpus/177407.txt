"First night took a 60 mg around 9p.  Woke up at 3am, 4am and 5am.  Around 6am super nauseous and puked several times along with explosive diarrhea.  A few hours later same thing.  Had no energy and felt lousy all day.  My body was useless.  Next day felt wiped out from previous day.  Better following day.  Never took again after first pill.  My body rejected and anything that volatile I don&#039;t want to try and &#039;get used to&#039;."
