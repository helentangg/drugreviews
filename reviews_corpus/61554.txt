"I had been experiencing severe depression and anxiety for 3 months due to a relationship break-up and unemployment.  Crying at least every other day.  Deep sadness.  Despair.  Really hurting.  Also had bad free-floating anxiety.  Could feel it come over my body. Horrible feeling.  Had no appetite(lost about 9 lbs over 3 months).  Sleep maintainence trouble.  Would fall asleep but couldnt stay asleep.  Libido was gone.  Went to Dr.  Was prescribed cit.  20 mg daily.  Within 1 week, crying stopped and sadness was gone.  I mean, gone!  By end of second week anxiety was gone.  By 3rd week my appetite was back.  Over the 4th week my sleep has improved. Side effects mild.  If you can relate to these symptoms try this med.  I thank God I did"
