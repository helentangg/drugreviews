"I have had depression since I was little.  After a traumatic event happened to me I became a competely different person.  I became even more depressed, did not want to live and became very isolated person.  I had a number of different doctors: one said I was BiPolar the other said something else.  THEN FINALLY after many years being nervous all the time: my mother found a Good doctor that actually listened to me and did not rush to give me medicines.  She said I suffer from social anxiety and started me at 10mg, and then went up to 20mg.  And I have been on this for over a year now and it saved my life.  I am able to go out again and I have a boyfriend, which I could not do before. This saved my life and I am much happier. Really."
