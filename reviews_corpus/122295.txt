"This helps my depression more than anything I&#039;ve tried. I&#039;m using Emsam and the ease of use is excellent. I have fibromyalgia and this might also be helping my pain, fatigue, and libido since I&#039;ve noticed improvement with all. At first I craved sweets but don&#039;t now. I have mild irritation at the patch site. I wake up at least once at night to urinate (where I didn&#039;t before) and I also want a snack at that time, too. Even with night eating, I think I&#039;m losing weight on this medication. My one concern is that I am definitely losing my hair on this. I will see my psychiatrist next week for a one month follow up and if the hair loss is easily remedied, I&#039;ll stick with it. Expensive without insurance."
