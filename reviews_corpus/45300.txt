"I&#039;ve only been on Fluoxetine now for 12 days at 20mg. I have a feeling I&#039;ll be going up to 40mg soon. Nothing much yet except I have noticed I don&#039;t &quot;blow up&quot; as much at everyone but it&#039;s  only 12 days. You need 3-4 wks to see really. I&#039;ve tried Lexapro  (sleepy all time &amp; wt gain)&amp; Sertraline  (went toxic in my body, liver enzymes went up, constant diarrhea, major wt loss) &amp; lastly Cymbalta  (helped with pain but not mentally and withdrawals were horrible). So antidepressant #4. I hope this one works! I do have loose bowels a lot in morning but take 1 Loperamide everyday. That&#039;s all really except sometimes anxiety goes up. Exercise will help."
