"I have been using cymbalta for about 6 months now, I have severe leg pain caused by compartment syndrome and chronic low back pain and my md has me on cymbalta and lyrica for this pain and it has kept it under control, I still have to take percocet a few times a day but my pain is better with cymbalta and my depression has even gotten a lot better. Two birds with one stone type of deal."
