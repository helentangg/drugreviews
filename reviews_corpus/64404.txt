"This medication has changed my life for the better. I started to feel better within about a week of taking it. I chose to take it before bed rather than in the morning which I think helped me to not feel any negative side effects. I&#039;ve tried 2 other types of medication but this is the only one for me that&#039;s helped reduce my anxiety but everyone is different so may not work for everyone but my experience on it has been positive."
