"I was taking Prozac (fluoxetine hydrochloride) for 10yrs to treat PMDD, postpartum depression, OCD. since I stopped this and started sertraline I realized the Prozac was weak in helping me! Sertraline&#039;s amazing! It has helped settle my major symptoms of illnesses above, I now live a normal life and everything isn&#039;t such a big deal to me anymore. I&#039;m more rational and certainly don&#039;t turn into a monster in menstrual cycle. I&#039;m much more calm and collected! Side effects I suffered sleepiness and irritability and dry mouth in the 1st week, that stopped. I persisted was going to stop thankfully I didn&#039;t! I have noticed as I have been on them 3 months now I have a decreased appetite, indigestion, slower digestive system which I can tolerate! Sometimes hyperactivity."
