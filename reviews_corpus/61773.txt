"This medicine not only created more tension and worry for me whilst doing an assignment the night before, but I wasn&#039;t panicking which I naturally should be. This drug has made me forget certain aspects in life which I dread, this drug makes you happy externally, but not physically or mentally or emotionally. This drug has hindered my activities in life in general and I&#039;m completely coming off all drugs and finding my true self now. I was actually glad the way I was in life previously. Peace."
