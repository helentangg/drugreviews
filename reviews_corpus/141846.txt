"Lexapro has been incredible for me. I am a 37 year old man. It has now been 5 1/2 weeks on 10 mgs and I feel amazing. For the first three weeks it was not effective and I did have some side effects, loss of appetite, fatigue, no sex drive (although I could still perform), trouble sleeping and I would wake up with a very uneasy feeling, basically anxious.

But at week four it all seemed to turn around. My sex drive came back, I started eating normally, I had more energy during the day. It is sometimes still hard to sleep at night, but not too bad. I am truly amazed at how I feel. I am a very successful person, have my own business, a beautiful family, but have always felt close to worthless inside, always feeling less than everyone else. "
