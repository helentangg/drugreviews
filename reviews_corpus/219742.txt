"Horrific.  First thing, 1st pill, was extremely dry mouth with a dry cough that last a couple of hours.  2 day same  but now accompanied with an internally anxiety accompanied by insomnia.  Within a week, felt like every adverse reaction mention in pamphlet and online was applicable plus some not mentioned (dry mouth, blurred vision, centralized stomach pain/gut, constipation and blurred double vision... OH! not to mention the vivid racing dreams anytime I could fall asleep.)  When I mentioned to Dr., his feeling was for me to continue meds.  Issues would work themselves out within a couple weeks more.  &quot;Ok doc. I&#039;ll give it a couple of weeks more of this torture these pills have put me in.&quot;  Went home and tossed them in garbage."
