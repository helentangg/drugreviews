"Female, 27 y.o., 20mg, also taking Bupropion. 
It really helped to &quot;lift the fog&quot; of my depression.  My boyfriend noticed my mood lift within a couple days.  It all but killed my appetite and I lost a lot of weight quickly; 17 lbs within a few weeks, 1-2 pounds a day.  My appetite gradually returned and my weight plateaued.
I experienced a different side effect every day during the 1st week. Numb; dizzy; nauseous; migraines. I quit imbibing because it only made me sleepy with a headache. That may have contributed to weight-loss and eventual regain as my alcohol tolerance returned to some degree. I still get the headaches, though less frequently, and I&#039;ll take a headache over crippling anxiety and depression any old day."
