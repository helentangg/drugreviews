"I&#039;m male, 52, and a diabetic on insulin. After developing severe peripheral neuropathy six years ago, I was prescribed Neurontin which did not work for me. After two weeks with no relief, I  checked into the ER due to intense pain. I was prescribed Cymbalta by the ER doctor and have never looked back. Within a couple of days the pain was gone! My feet and lower legs felt great, and the ominous feeling of intensified pain in the evenings had vanished. As for side effects, I sometimes have difficulty sleeping, and sometimes I feel a bit wonky-headed. However, those are easy trade-offs to accept in return for the pain relief I feel. Cymbalta continues to be my miracle medication."
