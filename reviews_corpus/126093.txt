"I was given this medicine for depression/anxiety, I had many of the bad side effects listed on the insert. My world became even darker than before and I started having suicidal thoughts. I thought I was losing my mind. I was not myself on this medication. I started having panic attacks and just feeling so out of control. My family was worried because of the severe reaction that I had. After changing to a different medication I was back to myself within a few days."
