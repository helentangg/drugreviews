"I never comment on these this but I feel this website sharing positive experiences helped me a lot. I had my first panic attack two months ago after a night out. Weeks of having 3-4 panic attacks a day and massive levels of anxiety followed. I tried to carry on with life as normal going to work, etc. and started CBT, which helped me establish it had started due to increased stress from work. I struggled to get on trains, tubes, eating in restaurant&#039;s, shopping...pretty much every day to day task. When I was put onto Cipralex and for the first four weeks I had high levels on anxiety, headaches, disassociation, tight chest, chest pains. Now on week 5 on Lexapro I am feeling much better and can do everything I did before with only low levels of anxiety."
