"First time I got a panic attack was about 4 years ago, needless to say it was horrifying, took my about three months from one doctor to another to check heart condition, nerves, etc... after my maybe 10th visit to the ER (not knowing it&#039;s a panic attack) doctor suggested I should I should visit a psychiatric, who prescribed Escitalopram and Lorazepam, it took me a while before the drugs started acting up but fast forward one year later i&#039;m feeling better. after than I relapsed and the same medication didn&#039;t work, so my doctor suggested to start taking Sertraline, it took me a couple of weeks before even remotely started to feel slightly better, side effects were horrible, but in 2 months I was back to my normal self. so, be strong, and wait"
