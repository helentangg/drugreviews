"All my life I&#039;ve suffered from depression. Within the last year, severe anxiety came out of nowhere and I&#039;d have about 2 or three bad attacks per month, on top of the multiple small attacks I&#039;d get daily. ESPECIALLY in social settings. But even alone. I completely withdrew myself from my classes and my social life because of this. 

 I started going to church. Meditating, running, praying, dieting, yoga, and trying to practice mindfulness.The failed attempts worsened my depression.

 I wanted the anxiety to stop so bad that I frequently considered suicide.  Its been less than a day taking Lexapro but I&#039;m so hopeful. Everything that felt like such a huge deal just hours ago are so minimal now. "
