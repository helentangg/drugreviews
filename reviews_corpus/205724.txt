"I was diagnosed with clinical depression over 13 years ago. I took Paxil for 1 year and swore I would never take another depression medicine. After some extreme and consistent stress in 2010, I talked to my MD and he suggested that my depression would not just go away on its own. After explaining my drug experiences he prescribed Lexapro and I took it for about 3 months. It was wonderful except that it just stopped working, I had gained 10 lbs and the sexual side effects were terrible. He changed me to Pristiq, which I have been taking for 16 days now. I never had nausea or dizziness. I feel less hungry than I did on Lexapro and there are no sexual side effects. At first I felt a bit spacey but now I have more energy."
