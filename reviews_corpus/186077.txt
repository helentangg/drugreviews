"Took Prozac for over 20 years.  It tends to stop working so tried many different antidepressants over those years.  None worked as well for me as Prozac and had various side effects.  Three months ago I went to a psychiatrist who put me on Pristiq.  I stayed on it one month, which was one month too long.  Lucky to have made it out alive.  Never had been so depressed in my life.  Switched to Zoloft and slowly came back to life."
