"I took Lexapro from Jan 2010-June 2010. This was due to depression in college. It took some time. I suffered from homesickness and stress in college. Then when I was off it and at home I was fine. I returned back to school June 2011 and I relapsed. I was not on medication, but I am pretty sure I relapsed due to past trauma. I will be getting better soon and will learn from my mistakes and will not take antidepressants any more. When I am on Lexapro I do feel like a zombie, but for me it took like 3-4 months to feel better. Also it messes up your sleep patterns. It also causes you to gain a lot of weight (even if you work out) and it makes you feel numb but it helps in the long run."
