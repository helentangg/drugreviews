"As a mother of two young boys I started feeling down and depressed and I couldn&#039;t even leave the house because of my anxiety. It started helping me after 2 days (half tab) now I&#039;m taking 1 and a half tablets and I feel so much better. its been a month since I have started this and I love it. I have tried Celexa, Prozac etc...nothing worked. THIS DOES! It makes me tired so I take it at night."
