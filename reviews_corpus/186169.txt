"I take Wellburtin XL 150mg and Pristiq and have been since 2009.  Tried to go off of Pristiq twice because my sodium level is a bit low.  Within a month of being off of Pristiq I got my old anxiety attacks, panic, insomnia, etc., so the positive definitely outweighs the negative.  Hopefully, my sodium will be corrected now that I&#039;m seeing a specialist for it, but for me Pristiq and Wellbutrin XL work wonders and I don&#039;t plan to go off either ever again."
