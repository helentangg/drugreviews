"This medicine changed our lives for a couple of bucks a month! My husband had suffered with generalized anxiety disorder for years but until I was at the end of my rope and googled his symptoms we had no idea.  We went to our doc, explained his symptoms, he prescribed Citalopram and oh my goodness life is as it should be.  My joke is, my husband doesn&#039;t like me when he&#039;s not taking his Citalopram!"
