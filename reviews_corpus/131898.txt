"I took 225mg of Effexor XR for about 6 years for MDD and was doing well until I started to notice a drop in it&#039;s effectiveness.  I then tried Lexapro (terrible) and Cymbalta.  The latter worked well for about a year-and-a-half, until, again, it&#039;s effectiveness waned.  My physician suggested that, since Effexor XR had worked in the past, I give it another shot.  I&#039;ve been back on 150mg now for over a year-and-a-half and am doing well on it.  The medicine, along with talk therapy, has helped significantly.  The side effects I experience are:  increased sweating, dry mouth, and loss of libido.  Also, missing a dose for more than a day is miserable, as it causes nausea, a &quot;disconnected head&quot; feeling and slight anxiety."
