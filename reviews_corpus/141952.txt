"I have been on Lexapro 10 mg for a little over two months, and I already have noticed that my depression crept back. I recently started 20 mg, about a week ago. I haven&#039;t noticed a difference. I have had severe depression for the majority of my life, and I probably would have killed myself without antidepressants, but I feel that I need to add another medicine or switch. It helps with the anxiety, but the depression is what makes me unable to function. This was a good drug, but I have pretty bad tremors, and I&#039;m thinking I need something more powerful."
