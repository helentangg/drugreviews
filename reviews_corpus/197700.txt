"I have been taking Pristiq for 6 months. The first two months, nothing happened. The third and fourth months were great. I was well balanced, no longer angry all of the time. I had motivation to do things, and I felt like I finally had the ambition to do something with my life. And then Pristiq just stopped working for me. As if my body had grown immune to it. I am still talking it regularly every day but I feel just as horrible as I felt before I started taking it. I am going to see a doctor next week to find out why it just stopped working for me. It&#039;s not fair! I read so many reviews on how it has changed peoples lives and fixed their depression. I was so happy to think that I&#039;d gotten the same result. I can&#039;t find a reliable drug."
