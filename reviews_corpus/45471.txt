"I was prescribed fluoxetine for anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder about a year ago but I stopped it for around three months and went back on it around six weeks ago. I also tried citalopram but I didn&#039;t like them. I&#039;ve also had treatment but I have to say fluoxetine has beaten it all, I&#039;ve never been so mentally free, it feels surreal and seems too good to be true. 

I haven&#039;t been sleeping well and I was sweating a hell of a lot at first."
