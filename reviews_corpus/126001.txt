"I have been taking Viibryd for two week, starting with the 10mg dose then 20mg. I had always struggled with small bouts of depression and anxiety but have always tried to deal with it on my own. Now that I am working 60 hours a week, I knew I needed some help. After the first couple of days of taking this drug, I noticed a significant difference. Situations are so much easier to deal with and I can complete task with a clear head and with focus. I am about to start my 40mg dose. Hopefully things only get better."
