"I have never reviewed a medicine before. I&#039;ve suffered from anxiety and panic attacks for almost 7 years now. I&#039;m very sensitive to medicine and I&#039;ve tried Lexapro, Wellbutrin, celexa, and one more that I can&#039;t remember. I&#039;ve also had to use klonopin as a back up. I hate taking medicine because it always makes me feel weird and that exacerbates my anxiety. It&#039;s been 4 weeks and this has been amazing! I don&#039;t feel weird or unlike myself, I haven&#039;t had to take emergency klonopin once, I was just promoted and have had the most stressful 7 weeks of work I&#039;ve ever experienced and I feel great! Amazing medicine, I&#039;m glad I gave it one last shot with this. Life changing."
