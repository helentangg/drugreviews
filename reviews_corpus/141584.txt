"I wanted to give this medication a go, but was pretty scared at the same time. The reason for that, was because I had used Zoloft (another antidepressant medication in the same class) before with severe anxious mixed manic psychosis.
Me and my doctor agreed to be very careful and increase the dosage in small steps.
What happens? It brings me complete depression relief and improves all of my anxiety (social anxiety in particular).
In the beginning there was some sleep disturbances and initial anxiety, but it subsided quickly.
It began to work very fast for me, but maybe it took about 6 months before full effects had come into play. I&#039;ve never had any episode since then, and no sign of over stimulation either. Great experience!"
