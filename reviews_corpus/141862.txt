"I&#039;ve been on 10mg Lexapro for a couple weeks now and feel much more capable of keeping myself in check during &quot;tough&quot; situations.  This is my second time on this Lexapro.  The first was a few years ago in what ultimately became a failed marriage.  Now, happily remarried, to a supportive woman with GAD, I am on it again.  This time though it is not my wife causing the the stress (good thing) and I think because of that, the medicine is working much more effectively, which brings me to my point.  Unless you change the things in your life, your life will not change."
