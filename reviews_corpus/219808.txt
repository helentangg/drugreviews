"I took Trazadone for depression and insomnia. Stopped taking it, because my weight would not go down and I was always depressed and &quot;out of it&quot;. Started taking Amitriptyline  I feel full of energy and not depressed. I also sleep better. I have lost 10 pounds since I started taking it 2 weeks ago. Everyone is different, so please consult your Doctor or Pharmacist. I take 25 mg at night."
