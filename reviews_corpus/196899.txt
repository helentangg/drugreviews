"I suffered with OCD and anxiety since I was a teen but as I got older I started to develop fears that were never there before and panic attacks started to get more frequent.My doctor put me on paxil and within two months I feel great,the anxiety is under control and my OCD is gone with the fears it created.

My side affects are about a 10 lb weight gain and it takes me longer to reach a orgasm which I consider a good thing haha.

I would recommend this to anyone suffering from anxiety and OCD."
