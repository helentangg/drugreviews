"One of the first reviews I&#039;ve written regarding a treatment. My IBS-D got to a point where I was visiting the bathroom about 5-6 times a day. When I wasn&#039;t in the bathroom the uneasiness associated with IBS stopped me from focusing on anything I tried to do. All I wanted to do was stay in bed and distract myself with movies and TV shows. I spent lots of time researching online and trying various treatments including elimination diets, supplements, various exercises etc.. My GP recommended I try Nortriptyline at nights starting at 10mg dosage and said that it&#039;d take around a month to kick in. After about 3 weeks I switched to taking it in the morning and it&#039;s been working wonders every since. Pretty much IBS free and have my life back."
