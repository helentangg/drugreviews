"I normally get headaches or migraines approx 4-5 times a week and have for many years. I have tried many different medications and nothing seemed to help or stop them. Finally I was given this pill and am taking 10mg per day. Since I have been on this medication I get 1-2 minor head aches in a month! Amazing!  Life changing! My nuerologist decided to up my pill to 20mg per day to see if it would completely get rid of them and since I started the 20mg my headaches and migraines have come back! I have now gone back to the 10mg per day and am hoping it will go back to the almost none existent headaches and migraines. So far so good. So be careful changing your dose otherwise such an amazing life changing pill for me! No side effects for me."
