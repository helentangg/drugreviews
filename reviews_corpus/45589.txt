"Before I started fluoxetine 20 mg I was so depressed almost lost my job couldn&#039;t get out of bed. I almost lost my family. I really don&#039;t know what triggers my depression my doctor says it&#039;s stress. My month on fluoxetine I didn&#039;t feel a change and had nothing but side effects from flu like symptoms to headaches. I&#039;ve been on it now for 4 months and this is the best medicine I&#039;ve ever been on. My anxiety is gone, most of the depression is gone. I can actually talk to people without worrying if they have an opinion about me. The only side effect that I still have is a jerk pretty bad when I&#039;m trying to go to sleep."
