"Hi I am 26 years old female, I would like to share this story to help others. I have depression for four years, which lead to mayor anxiety. I was becoming a recluse and I had an explosive temper, it was affecting everything I was doing. When I was first diagnosed I was put on  small dosage of Citalopram and then increased to the maximum dosages. The counsellors and doctors thought I was over the crisis after a year and half of treatment, but then a had a terrible relapse. I was placed back on Citalopram, but I felt like I was drowning. So after few tries with other medication they put me on Sertraline and I can honestly say it&#039;s been a gift from God. My mood is brighter and now I feel like I can live and get on with me life."
