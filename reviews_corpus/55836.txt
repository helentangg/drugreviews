"First time writing on here. Been on Effexor (instant release tablets) over 4 years. Average dose I hovered around was 400mg/day. At first I liked how it made me WANT to get out of bed in the morning, upped energy levels, &amp; didn&#039;t turn me into a Zombie. After a few months of this, I started getting a 2-3 hour block in the day when I&#039;d have indirect immobilizing anxiety. Thus my DOC threw Wellbutrin at me which did tone that down, for awhile. Then very slowly and without me attributing the following behaviors to the Effexor, I started to: take the first half of the day to &#039;get going&#039;, get dizzy 80% of the time &amp; always out of breath, binge drink for a few month-long chunks on end, not sleep, lose weight, become rather apathetic over more &amp; more."
