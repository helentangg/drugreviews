"I&#039;ve tried others years ago and could never tolerate them. I&#039;ve been battling some health issues for awhile which has caused anxiety and recently depression. I am one of those people who are sensitive to everything I take so was nervous about trying this. I&#039;ve only been on it for 5 days at 5mg in the morning. Mild nausea that goes away. I&#039;m hoping for some energy as fatigue is a big issue for me. I think I&#039;m feeling a bit less down but still to early to say I guess. I&#039;ll keep updating. Good luck everyone"
