"I&#039;ve been on 50 mg Pristiq for 2 weeks now. As a 39 year old male with anger/depression issues, I&#039;ve already seen a change in my behavior. I stay pretty mellow and let the small stuff roll (the things that used to make me really angry).  It&#039;s just starting to kick in so I still get angry but not near as much.  I&#039;ve also lost 8 pounds in less than 2 weeks. Side effects have been mild headaches, loss of appetite, and the weight loss. I experienced night sweats and weird dreams only once."
