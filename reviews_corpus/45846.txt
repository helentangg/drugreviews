"I was prescribed Prozac for depression last November and felt nausea for 2 weeks of taking it then it wore off. It worked really well for me until April this year and the effects seemed to just wear off. It was like I was leading somebody elses life. I wasn&#039;t in control of anything I did. I was extremely impulsive and took 3 overdoses on Prozac and was admitted to a psychiatric ward for adolescents. Once I came off Prozac I was able to control my implusiveness but I was very very low in mood and I had really bad electric shock impulses in my face, chest, arms and lips."
