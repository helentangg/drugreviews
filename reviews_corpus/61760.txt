"I have been on this medication for almost a full month now and I don&#039;t really feel any different. They keep wanting to increase the dosage because they think it will help me. I am on 40mg and it just makes me feel like I did before not happy but not sad. I have periods throughout the day where my mood drops so quickly and I stay depressed pretty much the rest of the day. I get extremely tired and it&#039;s not good especially going to school. It&#039;s a good medication but it doesn&#039;t work for me and my anxiety has been out the roof lately."
