"I was stressed due to work and began taking 10 mg. it worked when I took it which was maybe twice a week. 7 months after starting the med, I thought s bug was in my ear. After seeing one walk in clinic Doctor and an ear nose throat hearing test and X-ray, I went to my family doctor. She narrowed it down to this medicine because I take no other meds and have no other health concerns.my age is 39 female."
