"I&#039;ve been on this drug for the past three years. Originally started at the smallest dose and eventually ended up at the highest dose of 300 (and something) within the first year and a half of being on it. It had reached a stage where my psychiatrist was discussing adding another drug to the mix to make the Venlafaxine work better. Before I could start the other drug as well, I fell pregnant and went cold turkey. I was persuaded to go back onto Venlafaxine and 8 months later I&#039;ve shot up from the lowest to the highest dosage. It&#039;s not a case of becoming immune to the drug. For those who experienced great results that tethered out, you&#039;re not crazy. Venlafaxine has a tendency to plateau. It&#039;s not you, it&#039;s the drug."
