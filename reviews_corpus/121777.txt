"I&#039;m 19. I had a terrible abusive childhood full of alcohol and physical and mental abuse. Depression also runs in my fathers and my mothers family, and so my heads pretty screwed up. 
I was first prescribed Lexapro, that medication made me go insane, and now I&#039;m on 75mg of Effexor XR. I probably should take more, but in my experience with depression, it really keeps me down to earth and so I told my doctor this was good enough for me. I&#039;ve been depressed my whole life and I just want to be good enough to where I won&#039;t be suicidal. This medication is great. 
The only side effect is that if I sit in weird positions my feet will go numb really quickly."
