"I have been on this for 3 days now and on the first day I got severe sharp head aches in the back of my head and didn&#039;t feel as hungry as normal, second day I wasn&#039;t hungry at all and felt a little sick and today I woke up and almost fainted and my vision was blurry and i had a loud ringing in my ears and almost threw up and I&#039;ve been dizzy all day and barely eaten. The side effects are horrible, but im going to stick with it to see if it works."
