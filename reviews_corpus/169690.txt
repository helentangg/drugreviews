"Though it certainly helped me stay asleep once I had gone to bed, it caused me to be groggy the next day and I had the hardest time just getting out of bed. That could have been tolerable, however, if it were not for the hallucinations I suffered once I would lay down. It felt as though people were pushing on the mattress and grabbing at my feet. It was so bad, in fact, that it caused me to have to sleep with the light on, and I&#039;m a 32 year old man! This ultimately caused me to have to stop taking this."
