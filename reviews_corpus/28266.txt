"I was put on Lexapro for 6 months as a trial after having a major anxiety attack (my first one ever) to see how my anxiety would change. I was prescribed 20mg. Because I have never been on medication in my life and heard these things can be highly addicting I took it upon myself (and with the approval of my Dr) to only take 10MG for the duration of the trial period. I definitely feel it helps with anxiety in the short-term. I gained 40lbs, especially in my belly area and head HORRIBLE heart burn. I also had dizzy spells once in a while. I would not count on any meds for long-term. I recommend change in lifestyle than to suffer from side effects of meds. The good almost doesn&#039;t outweight the bad."
