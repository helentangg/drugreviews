"In the past 10 years, I lost my young husband and mother to cancer and recently suddenly lost my dad. I have 2 teens and an extremely stressful job.  I was having panic attacks 3 times a week.  Tried biofeedback , yoga, meditation, etc.  Prozac saved my life.  I can handle the little things, I have hope, I am no longer afraid or worried unnecessarily.  I awake refreshed and can get through my busy day without needing a nap at 2pm.  I have even lost weight because my compulsive eating has stopped.  Plus, my family life is less stressed and more fun because Mom is no longer an emotional wreck 24/7, and has healthy emotions and reactions to life&#039;s little bumps.  I can cry I am so relieved.  God bless you."
