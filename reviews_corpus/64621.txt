"Took Zoloft for Major Depression and Anxiety. Started at 25mg and went up to 75mg over time. Didn&#039;t have any full on panic attacks after starting the drug and noticed a lessening of my depression, however I had AWFUL insomnia even when taking it in the morning, and it didn&#039;t help my general/social anxiety as much as I hoped. The sleeplessness ended up making me more anxious overall and was not worth the benefits."
