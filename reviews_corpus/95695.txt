"After trying just therapy for panic disorder, major depressive, and general anxiety I finally gave in and starting taking Zoloft. THANK GOD! I haven&#039;t had a single panic attack in 5 years when at one point I was having them up to ten times a day! I have had zero side effects. I also took it through pregnancy. I&#039;m 28 and I&#039;m fine with taking Zoloft forever, living without anxiety is just amazing!"
