"I think in the end I just started taking it out of pure desperation. I used to have a horrible feeling of butterflies just walking down the street, always feeling irritable, wanting to be sociable but finding basic social contact a real struggle. Teamed with mild depression, my social anxiety made me feel worthless, unloved and hopeless but I also cared far too much what people thought about me. After two months this medication has changed my life. I have never felt more socially confident in my entire life. You may still have negative thoughts, but they are often replaced by a more rational one. Was on 50mg, now on 100mg. I never realised how much social anxiety inhibited me. I feel more hopeful for the future and now can love myself."
