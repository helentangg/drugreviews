"I&#039;ve been on this for over ten years. I don&#039;t recommend it to anyone who will ever want to get off it as withdrawal is HORRIFIC. No exaggeration. Has it  helped the depression well enough so I&#039;m functional? Absolutely. Has it &quot;cured&quot; me? No. It just makes life bearable. I should add that I also have BPD, so not being uselessly depressed all the time didn&#039;t solve everything. 
All that said, I have most recently stopped it (again ) thanks to my angry, destructive nature. I&#039;d been on 300mg and did a quick lowering of dosage to get off it. I just want to be myself as a mess instead of a drugged-up version of myself as a mess. Isn&#039;t there something wrong when a drug so greatly changes your brain? Doesn&#039;t its bad withdrawal mean it&#039;s dangerous?"
