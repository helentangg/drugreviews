"I&#039;ve been taking this medication now for 3 months and I&#039;ve noticed my depression is A LOT better. I do get down when PMSing (more so than normal).  I&#039;d rate it higher if it weren&#039;t for the electric shock feeling I get through my body if I don&#039;t take it at the same time everyday and my lack of a sex drive. I&#039;ve tried Zoloft (worked for 4 months or so and stopped working for me) and Effexor (I felt constant rage in my chest), so far the Viibryd is the best of the 3.  I also have post traumatic stress disorder so now I am looking to see if it&#039;s possible to add a medication to the Viibryd for this as it does not help for PTSD.  I take Xanax occasionally as needed for anxiety."
