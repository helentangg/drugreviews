"This medicine did not help my fibromyalgia at all. I had Doctor after Doctor ask me to take it as I searched for answers and relief. I finally had to stand up for myself and refuse to take it because it has such a strong effect on me. I felt like a zombie each time I tried it. This is regardless of how small the dose was. The medicine did nothing to ease my pain or any of my other fibromyalgia symptoms. "
