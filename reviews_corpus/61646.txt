"First of all, I just wanted to warn people of the reviews on here saying, &quot;&#039;I am on the 2nd day...&#039; &#039;It has been 1 week...&quot; 

This drug doesn&#039;t work like that. Whatever you&#039;re feeling before the WEEK THREE of taking this is pretty much irrelevant to the review, as Celexa&#039;s effects take at least 3 weeks to work properly and for the side effects to ease/disappear. 

That said, the side effects can be awful at the start but once you&#039;re well into treatment this drug can be a literal life saver. I was diagnosed with clinical depression 14 years ago, and this is the only SSRI that has worked for me. Its only after you&#039;re off it do you realize how helpful this drug really is. If the side effects do go away after a month, id suggest something else."
