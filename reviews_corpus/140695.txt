"For three years I self medicated with over the counter codeine for anxiety and depression. I never ever wanted to take antidepressants thinking I just needed to eat healthier, .be more social, find a better job, excercise etc.  After several weeks of panic attacks and gaining weight I decided I would fill the script for Lexapro (I got Lexam).  I took 5mg the first night and instantly felt calm, a bit dizzy/dopey and went to bed. The next day I felt spaced out and also defeated for taking them. It felt a bit like walking in water...slow. The next day I felt great! I&#039;ve been on them a week and no more anxiety, depression. Now I have something to GIVE to my family and friends and can work new Jobs and socialise and connect with strangers."
