"I went on this website when I was just starting out on Zoloft and it helped calm my nerves so I wanted to return the favor. When I first got on the drug I had every side effect. Extreme nervousness, extreme anxiety, insomnia, dry mouth, dizziness and depersonalization. I thought it would never end. But just as most of these posts state, most of the side effects went away in 2-3 weeks. I started taking it at night but switched to the morning and that helped a lot. I&#039;m on 25 mg and I have no plan or increasing the dose. I believe that everytime you lower or increase you will have side effects again. I wish I started on 12.5 mg(half a pill) because I think it would have helped with the side effects. The drug works... push thorugh!"
