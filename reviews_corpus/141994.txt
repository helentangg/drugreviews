"Lexapro is good it has really helped to calm me down. The first few days have been tough I have been nauseated, I have lost my appetite, I&#039;m restless, but overall it really is making a difference and I have only been on it a few days. It hasn&#039;t helped my depression yet, but I have been told it takes a while."
