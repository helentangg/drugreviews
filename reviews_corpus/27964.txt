"Only took 2.0 mg first time &amp; 2.0 mg in evening.  So 4mg altogether daily.  Instant relief upon first dose.  Immediate. Gave me headache first dose for about 3 hours but after that all good for 3 days.  On 4th day got another headache in evening for few hours.  Last night took it at about 10pm, got to sleep but woke up at 4am couldn&#039;t get bk to sleep til 7am.  Gives u vivid dreams that feel real.  I wouldn&#039;t recommend starting with any more than 2.5mg or 4mg max split in two doses at least 8-10-12 hrs apart. 2.0mg each dose max. I&#039;m thinking of making my evening dose just 1mg or bc it&#039;s much stronger and more of an upper than celexa. Does makes u feel tired but the anxiety is gone, less hypersensitive but can be too &#039;high&#039; agitating."
