"I suffered horribly with post partum depression and severe anxiety for 2 years after the birth. Felt so terrible. All the time, felt like I couldn&#039;t do anything. Everything overwhelmed me. Tried Prozac and didn&#039;t notice a difference for 2 weeks, then slowly started feeling calmer and could somewhat focus on tasks and errands. I started supplements, vitamin D3 and fish oil. Felt more relief with this combination of Prozac and supplements. Noticed a lift of mood and sleep was once again welcomed instead of torture. I had severe insomnia during my Depression. All I can say is I&#039;ve been on this combination for 5 almost 6 years and felt much better. My heart goes out to anyone suffering from this illness."
