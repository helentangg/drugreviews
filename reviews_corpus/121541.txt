"I started taking Effexor to counteract the hot flashes caused by Tamoxifen.  This was truly a miracle cure for the hot flashes.  Literally,  I took the first dose of Effexor and the hot flashes were completely gone within an hour.  I continued taking the medication for 4 days with not a single hot flash.  It was amazing! BUT I had to stop taking it because I slept about 10 hours in 4 days.  I constantly felt nervous,  anxious and unable to relax.  Sleeping was almost impossible.  Sadly I chose the hot flashes over insomnia.  Very disappointed "
