"I have been on Zoloft for about 6 weeks. I was experiencing depression which manifested itself in crying spells, anger, helplessness and loss of motivation. It took approximately 4 weeks for me to notice any changes,  but I have noticed recently that I have motivation once again and I have not experienced any side effects which i was dreading such as loss of sexual desire and weight gain.  I feel like my normal self again and able now to handle the issues of my life  Prior to this I was sad a lot and having many crying bouts.  I haven&#039;t noticed any negative side effects whatsoever."
