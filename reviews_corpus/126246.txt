"3rd week, and I&#039;m only on 15 mg. I am very sensitive to medication. For instance, Zoloft completely zonked me and all I did was sleep. I started taking Viibryd at night, but didn&#039;t sleep for 3 nights. I switched to mornings and have had no trouble sleeping at night. I take it with a meal and have not had nausea, etc. I did have a terrible headache last night and believe the pain in my calves may be a side effect. My muscles in my calves feel like I&#039;ve run a marathon...very sore and tight. Also, I&#039;ve been unable to &quot;stop thinking&quot; and relax. Overall I think Viibryd is working much better than Zoloft did for me (my sexual side effects are much less than with Zoloft), however I plan to call my doctor about the leg pain and racing thoughts."
