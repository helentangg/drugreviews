"As one of the reviewers who posted feeling &quot;different&quot; on day 1 or 2 on Pristiq, I am now on it for 10 days and I have been very tired up until today.  From day 2-8, I slept a good 12 hours daily which is hard to do with kids lol!  But today I woke up feeling good and immediately made beds, put on coffee and whipped up a great breakfast.  This may not seem like &quot;a big deal&quot; but for me, who was lying in bed crying for 8 or so weeks, it&#039;s a huge change and I hope it continues. 

I have been waking up frequently at night but it&#039;s not that bad as I can fall back to sleep easily.  As I said in another post, I was on another antidepressant for almost a year and it was horrible.  The hardest part was saying yes to the help offered.  Good luck to all."
