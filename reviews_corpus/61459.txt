"This medication works so well for me. I was having spikes with my blood pressure but only at night. I couldn&#039;t sleep well at all, so much anxiety about my blood pressure, and heart rate. I am really strong minded but this got the best of me. I reported this to my family Doctor and she prescribed citalopram 20 mg... not asking much about this drug I started it and much to my surprise I sleep like a baby and no more spikes with Blood pressure. I wake feeling refreshed no hangover and ready to meet the day. I don&#039;t have a problem being depressed at all, it was situational but this drug is a Godsent !!"
