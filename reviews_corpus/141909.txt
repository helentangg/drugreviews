"I&#039;ve been on Lexapro for about 2 weeks now. My mom and dad are going through a horrible divorce and I plunged into a deep depression. I hardly ever speak with my mom now and I distanced myself from friends/family. I stopped hanging out and I felt like I was in complete isolation. My doctor suggested that I try Lexapro for 6 months to a year. This is a life saver. I started feeling better within the first week of taking it. I&#039;m starting to feel like my old self once again. I was warned by my doctor that it almost always causes fatigue (which it did) but that was easily solved by taking it before bed. The only other side effect I&#039;m experiencing is loss of appetite. I love this medicine and would recommend it to others!"
