"I&#039;m in New Zealand and thankfully medication is fully covered here. In Feb I had my first panic attack and the next day it became a daily things, just waiting for the next one and horrible anxiety all the time. I sought help right away, as I was very sacred off the possible side effects of SSRIs I opted to try alternative options including Buspar, none of which really worked. Finally I decided to go on sertraline. I started very low on 25 mg Building to 100mg over 3 months. I have to say it&#039;s the best decision I ever made, side effects were minimal, just higher anxiety with dose increases but once I knew to expect it it was not so scary. I also have had no sexual side effects. This medicine has made life livable again, if you need it take."
