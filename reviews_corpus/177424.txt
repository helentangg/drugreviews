"Taking since 2005 for a numbness, icy, electric zapping feeling in my thigh. Started mild and escalated to unbearable over 15 yrs. Kaiser had ignored it for years &amp; I finally consulted an outside doctor who prescribed Cymbalta.
No side effects at all. Within weeks the unbearable electric zapping begin lessening. Over time a multitude of issues I thought were untreatable went away.  I quit falling down (I am no longer afraid of stairs), I could tap my toe in time to music (previously my reflexes couldn&#039;t keep up), the almost constant neuralgia that made my teeth hurt went away. At $350 per month, it was worth twice the price.
Now I can no longer afford Cymbalta &amp; the generic makes me so nauseous I cannot take it."
