"Not every medicine is for everyone, but as one who has tried most of the major pharmaceuticals for major depression, panic attacks, severe anxiety and anxiety related bouts of obsessive compulsive disorder, I can tell you Lexapro is the only medicine that I&#039;ve been able to stay on and be effective for my mental well-being...it is the only one I&#039;ve had no side effects with. Other SSRI&#039;s have either: made me more anxious and/or depressed, dry mouth, BAD weight gain, or extreme fatigue making me into a walking zombie during the day. I&#039;ve been on Lexapro 6 years now taking from 20 to 30 milligrams each day. During the months with the most sunshine, 20mg is effective. During months of winter, I have to bump it up by 10 mg&#039;s. I supplement with 4000 to 6000 IU&#039;s of D3 daily"
