"I was on imipramine for a little over a year, after trying every other antidepressant known to man. At first I noticed a major change. It was the  best I had felt in years. I was back to doing things that I used to do and felt great. It also helped me to sleep at night. The effects of the med started to decrease so we increased the dose until I was eventually on 100mg a day. That&#039;s when the side effect started. I went in for a routine doctor visit and my resting heart rate was 130. Of course panic set in and I had a bunch of tests ran on my heart, everything was normal. The only thing different was the increase in imiprimine. It caused me tachycardia.  So now I am in the process of weaning off of it. Onto something else."
