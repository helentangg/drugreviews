"I have been on Pristiq 6 months.  It took a few weeks of course (plus coming off the Wellbutrin), and there are still rare days when I want to curl into a ball, but they are less and less.  I am doing the things I enjoy again, also doing much better at work, actually would call the mood happy and energetic.  Friends and family have told me I seem happy and am doing the best work of my life.  I battle Depression, and I know that is lifelong, and I also have horrific life experiences that no drug can banish--so there will still be occasional bad days.  I&#039;m realistic.  But Pristiq is the best medication I have tried--a blessing. Each person is different: if it doesn&#039;t work for some, it works for many others."
