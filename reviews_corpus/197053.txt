"I&#039;ve been on celexa for 3 years and just recently switched to Paxil ...for the short time I&#039;ve taken Paxil I&#039;ve noticed an overall improvement with my mood and willingness to go out and be social without having a few shots of whiskey to give me the kick I needed. I have a diagnosed panic disorder which is anxiety on steroids. I&#039;m not sure just how well the Paxil will work months or years from now but I must say I&#039;m feeling pretty good now."
