"I have been taking citalopram 20mg for 3 days now. I have noticed that I&#039;m much like my self again. I do get some side effects but not that bad. Just hot flashes or something like that but that&#039;s it. I&#039;m glad I am taking this medicine as I have a family who needs me to be there and in the right state of mind"
