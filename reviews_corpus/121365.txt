"I only took this med, for 2 weeks. The first days, I felt great! I felt like this med, was going to work for me. Soon after, I started to feel; tired, sleepy, restless, I would get weird dreams and I started to feel mad. For the first time, I had a thought about suicide!!!! I know I have problems, but I love life...and I knew thinking about that was simply not me! Moreover, on Thursday- friday night I was out of town and missed the med. The downfall for not taking them has horrible! I felt dizzy, and nauseous.I literally felt like I was going to pass out! I felt drugged or drunk! And I started to throw up like never before. I&#039;ve never experienced nothing like this ever, sadly I&#039;m still trying to get better 4 days later. I now take Citalopra"
