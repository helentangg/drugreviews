"I&#039;ve tried three different SSRIs and one SNRI and have the same side effect with them all.....I can&#039;t achieve an orgasm.  My psychiatrist put me on Trintellix because it&#039;s not suppose to cause this problem....and it doesn&#039;t. On the other hand, I can&#039;t tell much difference in my depression, and I can&#039;t sleep, I&#039;m back to having mild panic attacks, and I feel like I&#039;ve had a breathing treatment with all the &quot;wonderful&quot;, not, side effects.  This isn&#039;t the medicine for me. I&#039;ve only been taking it a little over three weeks, but my psychiatrist is getting a phone call tomorrow."
