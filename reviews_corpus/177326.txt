"I&#039;ve been on Cymbalta/30mg for 1 week. Strong diarrhea first night, missed work the next day. Since then little trouble sleeping, napping on my days off. I work 12 hr shifts on my feet on a cement floor. I lost the feeling in my toes almost a year ago. Dealt with the hot coals burning on the bottom of my feet also. In such a short length of time I have had some relief in the burning of my soles and with the back pain. Hoping for continued improvement"
