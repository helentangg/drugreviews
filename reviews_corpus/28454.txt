"I have been severely bipolar since I can remember. My emotions controlled me instead of the other way around my whole life. It&#039;s tough to convey my struggles in a short quip. I am on 20mg of Lexapro and for the first time in my life (34 yrs) I feel normal. I take it before bed with Unisom. My life has changed drastically in one month. I went from drinking and drugs 2-4 times a week to waking up at 7 and keeping a schedule. I notice and feel a huge difference in my thoughts, not racing. I noticed that symptom gone immediately. Mood swings, gone. Depression, still shows itself but more moments of peace and clarity. I am a happy gal."
