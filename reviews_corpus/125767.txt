"I have taken many antidepressants over the past 20 years (Lexapro, Effexor, Wellbutrin, Remeron) and Viibryd is the best I have taken.  I loved Lexapro and took it for 15 years before it finally lost its effectiveness and I didn&#039;t think I&#039;d find anything better, but Viibryd is as good as Lexapro for me without the negative side sexual effects.  

The one caveat is that unlike the previous SSRI&#039;s I have to take Viibryd in the morning rather than at night or I get terrible insomnia.  With my dose in the morning I now have literally no noticible side effects and my mood, motivation, and motivation for things are all elevated.

Like any antidepressant there are negative side effects the first 2-4 weeks but those go away so hang in there!"
