"Please listen to me when I say that &quot;never start this medication&quot;!!!!! I was reluctant to try this only because a friend of mine talked to me about the withdraws. I (at the time) didn&#039;t have any plans on coming off of it so I thought....what the hay. I was going through a difficult time in my life and needed something to help my anxiety and depression that came from hurting those around me from my anxiety. This medication changed me. I didn&#039;t see it at the time. It made me completely numb to everything around me. Yes I could cry but did I really &quot;feel&quot; hurt? It caused me to leave a very amazing job that I was only at for 6 months...kinda one of those lifetime opportunities that I could kick myself for screwing up. Awful medication!!!!!!!"
