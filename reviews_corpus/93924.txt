"This medication was a life changer for me. After struggling with debilitating depression and anxiety and trying several SSRIs my pdoc did a gene test which uncovered that my body doesn&#039;t tolerate SSRIs, So he put me on trintellix which is an atypical antidepressant. I finally started feeling the light at the end of the tunnel. I started with 10 mg upped to 20mg . I am so grateful for my doctor for thinking outside the box and get me on the road to recovery. The first few weeks I did experience severe GERD and even took a PPI for it. But after a few weeks it thankfully subsided. I started to see improvement after 8 weeks."
