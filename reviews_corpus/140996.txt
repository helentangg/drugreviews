"I&#039;m on day 5 of half a tablet. Pretty much getting all side effects that I don&#039;t want. Brain not slowing down, insomnia, nausea, less sex drive, no appetite and headaches. However, having read all the reviews today I will persist. Like everything in life, we have to give it a go. My manic depression has been up and down all my life and I&#039;ve been mainly on Zoloft in the past but that just didn&#039;t work in the end. 
I will give the the four weeks but think I will stick to half tablet. 
Thanks to everyone for sharing your stories, you inspired me to take today&#039;s tablet. Here&#039;s hoping I will be back to functioning with a less hyper mood swinging personality soon."
