"I&#039;ve suffered from moderately severe episodes of depression and chronic anxiety for years. I have tried everything from Prozac to Cymbalta to Paxil to Remeron to Abilify. Side effects ranged from bad to intolerable. Headaches, weight gain, cognitive dulling. I almost gave up hope that anything would help. This medication has provided a lot of relief. My depression seemingly vanished. My anxiety is still there but seems a little better. Everyone&#039;s body reacts differently, but if you feel like you&#039;ve tried every other SSRI starting a low dose of this might really help. It could be the placebo effect for all I know, but somehow I don&#039;t think so because of the lack of success with past meds. I&#039;m on 5mg only. (I take it with low dose benzos)."
