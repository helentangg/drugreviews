"My doc switched me to Viibryd from Zoloft after Zoloft caused a long list of side effects (loss of libido, ejaculatory failure, zombie-like feelings, clenching/grinding teeth all the time, uncontrollable consumption of food and alcohol, increase in blood pressure). For me, Viibryd has restored mental balance.  My panic attacks and anxiety have been replaced by healthy concern for my problems.  I can sleep at night without panic attacks. I&#039;m more outgoing, talkative and social (presumably because it addressed undiagnosed social anxiety too). Depressive, suicidal thoughts are gone too.  The only side effect has been frequent and occasionally loose bowel movements."
