"Taking Effexor made absolutely no difference in the frequency of my hot flashes.  However, it did seem to make the hot flashes slightly less intense.  My physician increased my dosage to see if it would make any difference.   The increased dose did not make any difference.  Withdrawing from Effexor is not pleasant.  I started weaning off the medication almost 2 months ago and have not taken any of the medication for a week and am experiencing extreme fatigue and dizziness.  I&#039;ve been reading withdrawal experiences online and have learned that this could go on for several weeks. I wish I had never tried the medication."
