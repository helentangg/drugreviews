"After 1 month of losing my girlfriend and her mom in a horrible head on collision and balling my eyes out everyday feeling sooo lost i needed help!!
     Doctor put me on Zoloft 50mg for the first week to up it to 100mg thereafter... im on day 4 &amp; feel much better already not thinking so much of my loss.
    The only sides ive felt are slight headache &amp; slight nausea but now i have put down the box of kleenex from crying soooo much &amp; can relax better ...im going to continue to take it cuz the thinking of my loss constantly was nothing less than the worst time of my life ."
