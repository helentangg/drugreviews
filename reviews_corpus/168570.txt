"Okay so today I had a pretty good day but now I can&#039;t sleep. I have taken the 10mg as directed for 7 days and it was okay, nothing really changed. My terrible vivid dreams only seemed to get worse as I keep dreaming about the person that I love who does not love me in real life (he loves me in my dreams) and when I wake up I feel like I want to throw up. It is now 5 am and I cannot fall asleep because I&#039;m scared to have those dreams and I keep crying hysterically about it. I don&#039;t know what to do. I don&#039;t like this. I&#039;m 19 years old and I&#039;m a girl and I was originally taking paxil for a whole semester."
