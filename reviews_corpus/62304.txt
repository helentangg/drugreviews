"I started taking 20mg Citalopram on 10/24/12 it is 12/12/12 on the day of this review. I have taken it everyday, I choose to take it before I go to bed around 10pm or so, because it makes me feel &quot;different&quot; if I take it during the day. It took about 2-3 weeks before I was able to get off my lorazapam and soley rely on the citalopram. I still get anxiety from time to time but no anxiety attacks since I have been on it! I have pretty bad anxiety from life experiences, and 8 years working inner city Law Enforcement - been shot at several times, seen things that haunt me daily, you get the pic. I have a lot of gratitude for Citalopram. I used lorazepam for about 2 weeks as the Citalopram takes time to work."
