"I&#039;m Taking Cymbalta for Anxiety And Depression It Makes Me A  Little Jittery And If I Don&#039;t Eat With It I Get Sick to My Stomach But I Feel Better Than I Have In A Long Time And Where I Was Using Food To Cope With The Depression This Actually Regulated My Eating So Now I&#039;m  Eating Less With More Energy And Feeling Like A Million Bucks"
