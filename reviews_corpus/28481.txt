"Hello to everyone reading this. In the summer of 2012 I had the worst panic attack. I thought I was having a heart attack and immediately rushed to the hospital. Long story short, I was prescribed Lexapro since I was not progressing and had lost 40 lbs in less than a month. I spent nights crying asking why me. Within two weeks of taking 20mgs, I felt like my old self again. I was no longer socially anxious when it came to conversing with people and was thankful to be alive. The depressed and anxious me stayed home all day and lay in bed, but not anymore. Been off it 3 months now but advice to others is not to research 100 different sites for side effects."
