"I was given Effexor XR  for depression. I had the usual side effects at first dizziness, nauseous, weird dreams and tingly. I was able to beat most of these by taking the medication at the same time every night. The down side was if I was late by a few hours taking it the dreams and tingly feeling returned bad. I was started on 75mg and that worked for a few months then the dosage was upped to 150mg. This worked for a few months as well then I hit rock bottom again and the dosage was upped again to 225mg unfortunately this only worked for a few months. A year after this I was given it again this time it only worked for a couple weeks. This was not the medicine for me."
