"I took it for a week and could fall asleep at the drop of a hat...and I couldn&#039;t afford to being like that.   If you had to work all day all week and sometimes be up during the night. Paxil may work for some, but made me WAY to drowsy. My psychiatrist switched me over to 100mg Zoloft and while that was somewhat better, she also put me on a 150mg Wellbutrin  (zoloft   Wellbutrin commonly called &quot;Welloft&quot;).

Paxil was no good to me and quite possibly the worst to get off of."
