"I&#039;ve been on several medications but lexapro is the only one that has helped. ive suffered from severe depression, anxiety,panic attacks, obsessive compulsive disorder and ive had suicidal thoughts since is was 9 years old. lexapro has helped with all of this. i still have &quot;down&quot; moments but nowhere as severe! i am able to face reality better and was able to return to school."
