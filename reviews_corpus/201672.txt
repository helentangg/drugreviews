"I&#039;m currently 22 and a college student. I began having panic/anxiety attacks in July 2013. I thought I wasn&#039;t going to be able to attend class anymore cause I used to have a hard time sitting still. I felt the need to move around but at the same time I felt fatigued. I used to take L-Theanine, which helped some. I then switched to Zoloft, which is currently working good too. I feel more focused. I don&#039;t feel like crying for no reason anymore. I don&#039;t feel as angry at everyone anymore. Best of all, no apparent jitters--which was the main problem I was aiming at to get rid off. Thanks Zoloft. Now I can get back to focusing on my school work."
