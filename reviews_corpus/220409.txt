"I had my first episode of Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome about 3.5 years ago. It was sometime until the doctors and I figured out what it actually was. Nonstop throwing up for 2-6 days about once a month.  What made them severe I guess was the amount of vomiting. A few times I had double I.V&#039;s  because they could not rehydrate me as fast as the vomiting was dehydrating me.  If you have CVS and are reading this I just want to say I am truly sorry. It was a miserable and emotional ride for me and the people that care about me.  I can truly say I feel your pain and I pray that you find peace. I fought the doctors about taking this but when I finally gave in, IT WORKED. Not one episode since then (about 1 year and 6 months). I was skeptical at first BUT IT WORKED! 25MG."
