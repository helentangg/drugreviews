"I&#039;ve been taking effexor XR for almost a year now! I suffered from post partum depression! I&#039;m about to be 28 and had only taken an anti depressant back when I was 16 for less than a year. Negatives when starting effexor for me were insomnia and loss of appetite ! My doc prescribed me a low dose sleep aid and after 4 months of taking effexor I no longer needed the sleep aide! I&#039;m currently on 75MGs and I&#039;m productive, happy most days, and no more panic attacks that are unmanageable. I even gained my weight back !! This medication isn&#039;t for everyone but it worked for me! Negatives I still experience every now and then are rapid heart beat, hard to concentrate on one thing, and sometimes too much energy but can be levelled out with exercise!"
