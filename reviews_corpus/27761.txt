"I used to suffer from panic attacks frequently that made me feel like I was constantly about to faint or have a heart attack. It was so bad at one point I couldn&#039;t leave the house. I was extremely worried about taking this (probably as a result of GAD I was diagnosed with) but I&#039;ve been on lexapro since November last year and haven&#039;t had a panic attack since! It was hard getting used to lexapro at first and I experienced visual hallucinations upon waking up, but a small dose of valium helped take the edge off. Now anxiety isn&#039;t interfering with my daily life and I barely think about it. I&#039;m now learning meditation, CBT and looking after my physical health so I can wean off the drug later in the year when I&#039;m mentally ready for it"
