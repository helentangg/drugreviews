"Severe side effects - extreme dry mouth, extreme dizziness, extreme weakness. No real help for the neuropathy. Could not figure out why I was feeling so poorly, until I did some research online, and discovered nortriptyline has a negative interaction with FOUR of the other medications I take. Stopped taking nortriptyline, and felt so much better almost instantly."
