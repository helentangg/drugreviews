"Effexor does help with anxiety and depression,  but I had so many side-affects that I had to do something. My Doctor didn&#039;t want me to stop Effexor but after missing doses while on vacation I noticed that issues I was having seemed to ease up or go away.  This included, constant headaches, lack of interest in things, no motivation, &quot;E.D.&quot; and a constant ringing in my ears. I am currently on my second attempt to withdraw from Effexor and honestly, I think I have it beat this time. In the past I had quit smoking simply over night, gave up drinking, and went off my pain meds cold turkey. You must taper off on this med. It will SUCK! I have more energy and &quot;brain zaps&quot; have stopped. Now I have only insomnia to overcome. Effexor, the zombie drug"
