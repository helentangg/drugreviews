"I have struggled with anxiety my whole life, going on and off anti-anxiety medications.  I am a mom of three, a part time college student, and work part time.  Although I can&#039;t blame all of the stress I feel on the way I internalize things, I can absolutely say, Zoloft has helped me tremendously.  I feel like I can handle much more, I feel more clear minded, energized and happy. I believe I may have suffered from a mild OCD- obsessive thoughts mostly, but also very stressed when things in my house were not just so.  I didn&#039;t even realize how much I was driving myself crazy until I started taking the Zoloft. I can whole heartedly say, no other medication has worked for me this well.  I am just more at peace and that is priceless."
