"I have taken Prozac for depression intermittently for a few years it has taken me until tonight to realise that when I have gone for a few weeks without taking it is the times when I binge eat the most.  
Also I have been taking it a various different times of the day. Tonight I took it at 11.00pm and slept until 3.00am
reading these articles on this and other pages has made me realise where I have gone wrong.  So now is the time to put things right again.  I feel so much happier just knowing what I know now."
