"I am 21 years old, and a senior in college. I told myself that if I had a good experience on Zoloft I would share it. I have been on it for almost two months now. I started at 25mg and I am not on 50mg. I couldn&#039;t even sit through class without feeling like I was going to have a panic attack, and I could barely go out in public. I am on 1mg Klonopin twice a day (have been for a year). Zoloft worked WONDERS for me! I was suicidal as well and had crazy obsessive thoughts. Those have been completely diminished. I have tried other anti-depressants, and they made me feel gloomy. However, Zoloft has done the opposite for me and has brought me back to my old self! I had minimal side effects, and I am completely adjusted now. Thank you Zoloft!"
