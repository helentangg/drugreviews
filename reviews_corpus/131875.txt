"I have been on Effexor 37.5 for 2 weeks now. It immediately stopped ALL hot flashes for 2 days. Since then I have occasional, very mild hot flashes. My doctor told me to check in with her after 3 weeks. I may ask about increasing the dosage to 75. I was a little drowsy at first, then realized I was also taking an allergy medicine with a side effect of drowsiness so I stopped the allergy medicine. I agree with others my mood is better, also, my hair has more body and not so limp anymore. It must be a result of not sweating so frequently and severely from the hot flashes. I haven&#039;t noticed any other side effects. I wish I would experience a loss of appetite, that would be nice."
