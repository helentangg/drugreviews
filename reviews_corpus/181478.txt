"I took this medicine for 7 days lost my appetite the 3rd day, worsen my insomnia, it did not help with anxiety. By the 7th day I felt even worst finally decide to come off it. This is my second day off Prozac and I still cannot eat, sleep still have bad anxiety and feeling sick to my stomach and cannot eat anything, I&#039;m extremely nauseated, haven&#039;t ate much in 4-5 days. I hope my appetite comes back soon! This med did not work for me it made me feel horrible."
