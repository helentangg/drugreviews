"I started taking 50mg generic sertraline about 2 weeks ago.  I have had a very good experience with it and I love it. Thank God for this medicine and the improvements that it makes on the brain chemistry. Only experienced diarrhea for 1 day (which was okay for me because I&#039;ve always struggled with constipation which only contributed to fatigue and depression). I&#039;m more social (before I didn&#039;t care about doing much, even though I wanted to go out, when it came time to, I would end up going to bed), more easy going, less irritable and cranky. So much more patient with my kids. No side effects for me. Oh and I&#039;m not eating ravenously at night because of stress and anxiety like I used to so it&#039;s helping me lose weight. Yay!"
