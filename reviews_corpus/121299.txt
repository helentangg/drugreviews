"Good. Probably the best first-line antidepressant option I&#039;ve tried. Works within a few days if you&#039;re lucky. It&#039;s nice going outside, feeling good again and having a quiet mind. Just be aware of three things 1) it comes with a fair share of side effects - notably fatigue, difficulty falling asleep, difficulty waking up and usually gastrointestinal   sexual issues. 2) for me, it stopped working after a year or two so mix up your lifestyle and identify, make changes whilst you feel good 3) withdrawal is awful but not as bad as you imagine it will be - just be prepared to sign off if necessary and keep friends, family close. Cognitive blunting as a result of either the depression or the medication is still with me a few months on."
