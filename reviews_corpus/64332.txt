"I was diagnosed Bipolar with severe depression, ptsd, and anxiety in May of 2015. I have been suffering since childhood. I used to have racing thought, nightmares, suicidal thoughts, extreme highs and lows within minutes, etc. I can now be around family and friends without screaming, deal with traffic and go to the grocery store without having a mental breakdown. The first couple weeks were rough but wore off after 3 weeks or so. I have been on it since May, 2015 at 200mg a day. Lately I have had horrible migranes and nausea and don&#039;t have any motivation to find a new job."
