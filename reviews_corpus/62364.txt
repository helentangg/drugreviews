"I have been on Citalopram 20 mg for close to 2 months now. I did not experience any side effects other than being a bit tired for the first 3 days on 10 mg and a few minor headaches. Normally, I got every possible side effect possible when I tried a new medicine. I&#039;m not sure why this one was different. Before I started this medication, I was experiencing severe panic episodes daily and sometimes even panic attacks. It was to the point where I was avoiding almost everything just to reduce my chances of being anxious/panicked. I started it and I do NOT regret it. It took me about 1 month to feel ANY effect at all (So don&#039;t lose hope). But now, at 2 months, it just keeps getting better every day. I can say that I&#039;m almost anxiety FREE! TRY THIS MEDICINE."
