"I was initially very hesitant to go on any SSRI for anxiety purposes, but when the constant &quot;what if&quot; and worst-case scenarios and occasional panic attacks at work were having a considerable impact on my daily life, I knew it was time. I started and stayed on 10mg citalopram for one year and within several weeks found that the worry was not GONE, but controllable. It just takes the edge off - lightens the anxiety and helps me rationalize and quit ruminating. I managed off them for a year and am now back on for extreme stress and am happy to have this option available to me. Don&#039;t psych yourself out reading all the bad reviews - have faith that this will help you, and if it doesn&#039;t, no big deal - speak with your doctor and try something else."
