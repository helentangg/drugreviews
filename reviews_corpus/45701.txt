"I am going through menopause, I have been crying most days for about a year, I have constant obsessive negative thoughts about myself.  I went to the doctor to request HRT. She talked me into Prozac. I was diagnosed with low depression, mid range anxiety and high stress. I have only been taking this for 6 days, but already my life has changed. The tears have stopped, I am no longer obsessing about things that might or might not happen, My confidence is back, I am reaching out more socially, and feel once again that life is good. I do however eat well and exercise regularly, I don&#039;t think any thing can counteract a poor diet and no exercise. Hot flashes have also almost disappeared. So far no side effects."
