"I have spent a long time trying to find the right cocktail of meds since I was diagnosed with BPD, Bipolar, Depression and anxiety. Currently I&#039;m taking 100mg of Lamactal, 50mg Cymbalta and 50mg of Trazadone. I feel awesome! I&#039;m not as moody, I&#039;m happy. It&#039;s a shame that I have to switch medications because I LOVE my mood, however the sexual side effects are just something I cant take. My NP is putting me on Viiebyd instead of the Cymbalta and from reading the reviews, I&#039;m nervous about it. If the new medication dosnt work for me, I will go back to the cocktail I was taking and figure something out with the sexual side effects"
