"I have taken Prozac 20 and 40mg quite a few years ago with really positive outcome, but at a point it stopped working so I went to welbutrin.  recently I started to get panic again and my doctor thought adding Prozac into my daily regimen would help because it worked so well in the past.  The side effects were so difficult for 3 weeks.  crying, unable to eat, anxiety every minute, lost about 10 pounds which was a good side effect :).  but they did subside.  It seemed to be working but now some days I am having anxiety again and tremors daily.  Unfortunately it isn&#039;t working this time around and will be switching off it, but I would definitely recommend it for people since it did once work wonderfully for my panic and GAD."
