"I started with Lexapro about 2 years ago. I was angry at everyone. Someone walking down the street, someone in a car, people I didn&#039;t know let alone my family. I was in pain, working, doing what you have to do and I was mad. This was a great medicine for me. I take many other medicines but this is one I wouldn&#039;t want to give up."
