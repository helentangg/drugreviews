"For 8 years I have suffered from anxiety and depression, and this last year I began having debilitating panic attacks, most often while driving. I was very much against the idea of taking medicine as I thought I could heal myself. When things hit rock bottom I decided I had nothing left to lose. I started 10mg four days ago and it is the best decision I have ever made for myself. Day one was a bit strange and had one major panic attack, but since then have had zero anxiety or panic and zero side effects. I even went for a joy ride today in my car, because now I can drive without fear! Please please seek help if you&#039;re struggling, my only regret is not starting this medicine sooner."
