"After trying many more modern anti-depressants which I found uncongenial due to primary, or
side-effects, I tried Parnate.

From the initial dose I felt a lift in my mental state, &amp; although I have had to increase the dosage to maintain this improvement, it is ceratainly worth the diatary restriction hassles.

The only bugbear is difficulty in getting to sleep, &amp; having to take sleeping medication to cope,
 with the unwanted effects that come with using them.

Overall though, the Parnate has been most useful."
