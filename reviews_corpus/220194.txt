"I have had IBS since I can remember as a child I thought it was a normal thing cause I&#039;ve had it all my life. I&#039;m in my 20&#039;s now and a few years ago is when my ibs got out of control. I&#039;ve had many medical visits to the ER for my ibs pain and boy let me tell you the pain is unimaginable. I even contemplated suicide yes I was in that much pain and suffering after many failed attempts from different medications I did my extensive research and pretty much told my doctor that I wanted to try this medication im on 25mg this medication is a miracle why have these doctors been hiding this medication from ibs suffers iam now pain free and I can live my life with my family and enjoy every minute of it please try this medication it does wonders"
