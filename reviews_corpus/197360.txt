"I have been on Paxil for 10 years now.  I maxed out on the dosage at 60mg/day.  It served me well and improved my anxiety symptoms. Having gotten married 2 months ago, and anticipating getting pregnant, I began to wean myself off.  I went from 60mg/day to 40, then to 20, then 10, and now 5mg/day.  Each time I started to feel better and adjusted to the lower dose, I lowered it again.  The withdrawals have been awful.  I have been so sick for the last several weeks.  Nauseous, dizzy, insomnia, &quot;zaps&quot;, no appetite, no energy.  Now at 5mg/day, I feel better.  The withdrawals are now quite tolerable.  My next step is 2.5mg/day, then done."
