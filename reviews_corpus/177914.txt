"I am on Lyrica 150 mg a day, but it started to lose it&#039;s effectiveness after about 5 months. I can&#039;t afford to see the doctor or get more Lyrica. I tried Cymbalta for my PMDD and hoped that it might help my pain too.  My pain was almost completely gone after about 2 days of use!  However, I started getting sores on my tongue, emotional numbness, and had zero libido. I stopped using it after about 7 days, and the pain came back worse than ever (I believe I had been overdoing it those few days).  I seriously considered putting up with the side effects just to get some pain relief, but I&#039;m trying bupropion XL first."
