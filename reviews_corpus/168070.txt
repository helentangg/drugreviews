"I had my first panic attacks immediately following the birth of my first son 18 years ago when I was 28 years old.  The panic attacks were horrific and occurred randomly. I was prescribed a few different medications that weren&#039;t successful, but when I was prescribed Imipramine, I felt I had my life back. I doubt that I could have continued to be a primary school teacher without Imipramine.  It has really been a miracle medication to me.  When doctors hear that I take Imipramine, they usually comment that it is a really old drug that has been around since the 60&#039;s. Then they ask if I&#039;d like to try one of the newer drugs.  No way!  I feel perfect on Imipramine. I can&#039;t say enough great things about it."
