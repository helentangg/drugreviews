"I am on day 2 of 20 mg escitalopram and this is my first time taking any kind of SSRI. The first day I got really sleepy and felt kind of numb. Also extremely nauseous and a little loss of appetite. Today(day 2) I didn&#039;t get sleepy right away after taking the pill and I am not as nauseous. Oh I have been yawning a lot. I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Social Anxiety. Overall it isn&#039;t bad so far."
