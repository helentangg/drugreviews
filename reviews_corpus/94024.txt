"This drug was a miracle worker for me. I have battled depression for about 20 years and have been on various medications. I have been on Wellbutrin for 5 years but the last year it wasn&#039;t working at all. Crying all the time, suicidal thoughts and constant sadness. My dr started me on 10 mg of trintellix in addition to the Wellbutrin. What a great change. I no longer feel suicidal and no longer sobbing all the time. I am laughing again and love life. The first couple of days u do have an upset stomach but it is well worth it!"
