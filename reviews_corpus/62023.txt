"After going through a series of tragic events I was clinically depressed.  My doctor put me on Citalopram for the depression.  I also told him that I thought I was also obsessive/compulsive since I just couldn&#039;t turn my brain off from going over negative events.  I felt like I was going insane.  He said that the Citalopram was also good for O/C disorder.  Although I don&#039;t usually like taking medication (don&#039;t even like to take an aspirin when I have a headache) I have found Citalopram to literally be a life saver.  I have not had any side effects whatsoever.  I work 14 hour days in the film industry and this medicine does not make me tired. I take 20 mg at night."
