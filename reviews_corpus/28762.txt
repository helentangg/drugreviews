"I had been trying to convince my boyfriend of 6 years to go to the doctor and get something prescribed to treat his panic attacks, GAD, etc. At the beginning of last year he finally went to the doctor after enduring panic and anxiety for 5 or 6 years. The doctor prescribed him Xanax which helped a lot but he still was unable to do a lot of things. Today is his seventh day using Lexapro and I am already beginning to see a difference in him. The first 4 days he had some pretty shocking side effects, i.e. dry mouth, nausea, bit of dizziness and unable to reach orgasm. However judging by how well he is doing on day 7, I have very high hopes for this medicine and am excited that he is finally going to get to really enjoy life the way he deserves."
