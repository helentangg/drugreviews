"My new doctor recently switched me from klonopin to Cymbalta. I&#039;d been taking Klonopin for two years at a low dose with NO issues, but this doctor can&#039;t help meddling. Anyway, this Cymbalta is a nightmare. I&#039;m not depressed, just have anxiety, so why am I taking this? I&#039;ve been so edgy and nauseous since starting it. I can&#039;t sleep, and sit in meetings at work spacing out. Never take this medication. I&#039;m seeing my doc next week and am just going to flatly say I&#039;m not taking this anymore. Luckily a different doc prescribes the Klonopin."
