"I have not been able to stay awake for more than a few hours at a time and so depressed that I couldn&#039;t go out in public But since I have been taking Effexor I am 100% better. I am a new person. I want to get out and do things and I sense of well being. I love this feeling!! its like a new me. I am better than ever."
