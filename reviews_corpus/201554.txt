"I lost my mom at the age of 20, I am now 24 and been on Zoloft 150 MG for the past 3 years, I can&#039;t believe the difference this medication has made. Zoloft gave me my life back, no longer have panic attacks, constant crying, and crazy thoughts! I would recommend this medication to anyone who suffers from depression!

Thank you Zoloft!"
