"I&#039;ve been on new medicine Brintellix for 12 weeks now. I have Manic Disorder, so I have been on every medicine you can imagine since 8th grade. It&#039;s sad, I&#039;m 22yrs &amp; still breakdown in public. It was difficult for me at first since my depression left me motionless &amp; incapable to think or feel. I was given 10mg a day but took 20mg, I know I wasn&#039;t supposed to do without telling my Dr. (4 Day) able to move &amp; think somewhat. (6 day) move &amp; critical think. I&#039;m not saying this medicine is magic but at least I can function. Kind of in-between with no real highs or lows emotion. Notice I get serious nausea to the point of vomit on 10 day haven&#039;t gone away. I also take Prozac and Zyprexa. Don&#039;t think I&#039;ll ever be normal but as long as I&#039;m not suicidal it will get be better."
