"Started taking this a week ago for moderate depression and anxiety. I&#039;ve been on Zoloft and Paxil before but the Zoloft made me exhausted and the Paxil made me gain weight and missing doses caused &quot;brain zaps&quot; like mini electric bolts. I felt better the very first day, and I knew the exact moment it came on. Even a coworker noticed my smile was like nothing before. Every day thereafter my mood has been amazing.  My doctor told me to start with 10mg, and then 20mg after a week but I jumped right into the 20mg because I know my tolerance for medicines. I still have some social anxiety so he may bump me to 30mg next visit but right now even at this dosage I feel like life is worth living and is manageable."
