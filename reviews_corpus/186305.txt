"Great results on this medicine. The first couple of days I was a bit tired but that went away quick. My doctor prescribed it to me for general anxiety and not depression. So no crazy thoughts or ideas. I take it in the morning and that&#039;s it. No disruption of my sleep patterns. Actually I sleep like a baby. Very positive experience."
