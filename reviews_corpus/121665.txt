"I started taking Venlafexine 75 mg daily 5 weeks ago for Major Depressive Disorder. I was first tried on Prozac 40 mg and it did not help at all. For several months I was feeling constantly exhausted, no energy, no motivation, crying, and missing a lot of work. On the 2nd week of Venlafexine I noticed I wasn&#039;t feeling so exhausted and starting to get my energy back. I am now on week 5 and feeling like myself again. I&#039;m able to get through work and come home and take care of things around the house. Where before I was leaving work early and going straight to bed. I am very glad my doctor started me on this medication. Before the Prozac I had never been on any medication before. I have had no side effects or weight gain."
