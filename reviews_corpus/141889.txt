"I&#039;ve been on Lexapro for 5 weeks and started feeling more myself within 2 days! I no longer just lay around the house for the next day to come. I&#039;m more active and want to have fun again. My only complaint is the constipation and lack of sex drive. Great things are that I no long binge eat when sad, food no longer makes me feel happy, and its working as a great appetite suppressant which has made weight loss much easier. My doctor added Wellbutrin to help with the sexual side effects and I hope it starts working soon."
