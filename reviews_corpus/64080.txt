"My story goes like this : In December my life was turned upside down, my best friend got killed. Like most people I cried, but then got on with my life .. until 6 weeks ago : I found myself sitting on my balcony 14 stories high at 7am planning to kill myself. I had wrote a letter to my parents and my friends apologising for letting them down. I stood from my balcony and attempted to jump. 
I didn&#039;t, something stopped me, as I didn&#039;t want to die. 
Baring in mind this depression came on so quickly .. I went to bed, and woke up with these awful thoughts. 

I rang my doctors in tears, they got me to see somebody straight away.... and I can honestly say ... I have never looked back. 
These 50mg tablets are the best thing that has happened to me"
