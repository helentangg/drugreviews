"Cured me from years of binge eating that I thought would be with me until I died. I can now say I am extremely happy and healthy and binge free! It took me about a month and a half to feel the drugs effect so please DON&#039;T GIVE UP! I did have terrible side effects for the first 6 weeks such as stomach ache, drowsiness, bad dreams, lack of energy. But these all wore off gradually and it was so worth it!!"
