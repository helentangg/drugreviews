"I can&#039;t take NSAIDS anymore, so tried Cymbalta. Worked great for my pain and my depression. HOWEVER, I had to stop it because of horrible side effects. The worst headaches I have ever had, dizziness, and eventually mood changes. I took it for about 7 months total, the last 2 months was tapering off. My Doctor had a patient end up hospitalized when they rushed the taper. "
