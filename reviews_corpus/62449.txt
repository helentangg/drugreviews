"I have been taking Celexa about a month and a half for anxiety. I didn&#039;t go to the doctor, on the given day, to get anything but an antibiotic for being sick. I walked out of the doctor&#039;s office that day with Celexa also. I was VERY fearful of taking a type of drug like this, but I was also tired of being very anxious - always have been. I was easy to irritate. I couldn&#039;t handle stress well and couldn&#039;t seem to focus at the task at hand when I was stressed. Celexa has taken away these feelings. I feel &#039;normal&#039; now, so to speak and can handle everything better. I can also orgasm, no problems (am married) ;-) and I have NOT gained any weight! I can cry also and have normal emotional responses. Celexa has been great!"
