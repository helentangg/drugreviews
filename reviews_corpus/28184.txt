"Please, please give it a chance to work. The first week my anxiety ramped up. A few days in I was so sick in the morning I was concerned I may be pregnant (nope, the meds did it). But the nausea subsided and the anxiety slowed down and at about 5 weeks in it was basically gone. Xanax helped, but I no longer need it now. Prior to this I felt like the walls were closing in on me. I couldn&#039;t focus and I was filled with terror and unreality. Lexapro made these symptoms go away. I don&#039;t have constant thoughts and I don&#039;t live &#039;in my head&#039;. Please give it a chance. Stick it out, I promise it worth it,  if you felt anything like I did you deserve to feel better and it saved me from the looney bin. I have my life back. 5 mgs. to start and now on 10"
