"My husband has bi-polar disorder and suffers from chronic back / sciatic work-related pain. He&#039;d only been (restlessly) sleeping 2-3 hours a night for past 10 years. This had increased his mood swings and cyclothymia to unmanageable proportions!!
UK doctor prescribed 10mg amitriptyline, to be taken at night 2 hours before bed. After two weeks this was increased to 20mg per night.
The effect has been nothing short of miraculous.
He sleeps really well for 7-8 hours a night, wakes refreshed &amp; cheerful.
It&#039;s helped him cope differently with depression - staying calm &amp; getting CBT therapy. (Something he&#039;d never have volunteered for in his &#039;normal&#039; bi-polar anger / depression cycling).
Has also noticed lessening of pain. 
It&#039;s saved our marriage."
