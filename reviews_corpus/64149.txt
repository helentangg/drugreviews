"I was put on this medication and found it to be useless, it just made me worse, my brain just went dead, I could not think what to do, there were no memories of my past, I had no thoughts, I just felt so numb and unreal, and it was agony dealing with it, I was just a walking zombie. So after a month I just stopped taking it, I told my doctor I had stopped, because of the reasons I described. I have been on all sorts of medication, but nothing really did any good what so ever. I decided not take any more  medication, and gradually over time, a long time, I did eventually get back to being nearly normal. I still have days where I don&#039;t feel right, but I prefer that to being a zombie."
