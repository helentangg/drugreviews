"This medication is absolutely amazing. I&#039;ve tried Prozac, Wellbutrin, Zoloft, Celexa, Lexapro, Viibryd, Paxil and Cymbalta over the course of ten years.

Brintellix was the first medication that didn&#039;t give the unpleasant &quot;disconnected/sedated&quot; side effects of other SSRI&#039;S. As a male, the sexual side effects a minute.

I began on 5mg for two weeks and achieved a therapeutic dose of 10mg once a day. I have my life back and it also helps with obsessive compulsive disoder symptoms. I suggest taking right before bed, as it can make you a little drowsy."
