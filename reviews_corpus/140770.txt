"This drug changed my life. I&#039;ve always been &quot;depressed&quot; person if you will, problems from childhood, then life got hard when I moved country and my husband deployed. Almost within a week of taking lexapro I began to notice the difference. More stable, more optimistic, no longer crying over anything... Things that would give me major anxiety before no longer bother me as much, although the anxiety is not completely gone. Only very mild side effects of dry mouth and slight headaches, but boy is it worth it.  I am, what must be &quot;normal&quot; to the rest of the world now. I&#039;m very happy."
