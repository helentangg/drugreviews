"My experience with sertraline (Zoloft/lustral, 25mg to 50mg over the course of a week) was hell on earth. One of the biggest regrets of my life. I will never poison myself like that again. Please save yourself from the pain this drug causes - both physical and mental. And please be aware that this pain lasts after you&#039;ve stopped taking the drug."
