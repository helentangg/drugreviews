"I have been takin sertraline now for nearly a year. .I was adamant I would never take tablets for anything psychological but after confiding in a Dr about things from my past I thought I had nothing to lose...I will never ever b able to envision just how much these tablets have changed my life. .I didn&#039;t know people&#039;s brains actually worked so slowly!!! Mine had done over time for the last 30 years!!!! ...absolutely given me my life back :)..ohh..no side effects at all btw :)"
