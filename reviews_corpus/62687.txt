"I feel so much better since I started taking Celexa 2 weeks ago, I am 41 and was feeling very negative and tired all the time and sad. I didn&#039;t want to interact with people. Now I feel like I did 15 years ago, it&#039;s great, more energy, I sleep less and I am doing more things socially, already.  A few side effects were headache and eye pain but they have almost completely gone away and I am so glad I stuck with it."
