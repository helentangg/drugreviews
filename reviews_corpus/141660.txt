"I took Lexapro for approximately 3 years for OCD and panic attacks. Initially it did help the OCD and anxiety, but I then seemed to adjust to it and it did nothing for me anymore. I did gain about 15 lbs on it. It took me about 8-10 weeks to get off it and I have to say the withdrawal is the WORST feeling in the world.  Now that I&#039;m free of it, I&#039;m back to the OCD and panic attacks, but can&#039;t say I would go back on the Lexapro."
