"I have had at least 18 migraines a month for sometime and have been on every medicine but did not work until now. I started taking Elavil 25mg a little over a month ago and I had two migraines the first week for which I used Fioricet because it really works. But after that so far I have not had any migraines. It&#039;s been awesome and my family love it because I am not constantly asking for everyone to be quite and run to a dark room. I use it a night because it does help me sleep, but has been a wonder drug for me so far."
