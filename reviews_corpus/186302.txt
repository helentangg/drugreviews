"Made me thirsty to the point of headaches at first, as well as insomnia at first, but then it evened out. It helped me concentrate and stay awake, and I felt generally happier and more active. 100 mgs made me ridiculously manic and upset, but 50 mg was perfect for me. I simply quit it when it stopped working."
