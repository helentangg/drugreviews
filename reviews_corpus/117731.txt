"Took the edge of the pain.  Did boost my mood, and the tiredness took a day or two to adjust too. The worst was the dry mouth- I couldn&#039;t go anywhere without a bottle of water- and my blood pressure dropped to a dangerous low.  When my doctor took me off it, I ended up in the ER with a Flare up I hadn&#039;t experienced since being on the medicine."
