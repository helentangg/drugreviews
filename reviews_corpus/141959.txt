"Was prescribed this medicine to combat my generalized anxiety disorder. It worked fine for a few months, but then I got depressed.  I didn&#039;t want to leave the house, talk on the phone, or even text or email any friends at all.  I also gained 20 lbs.  That might have had something to do with the depression that suddenly came about also.  This might work for some people, but I was not one of them."
