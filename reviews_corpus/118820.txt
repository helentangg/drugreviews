"I started taking Zoloft after a very bad head on collision left me with post traumatic stress disorder and severe anxiety. I was taking Xanax but it did not help. I just started the Zoloft and agree, it is a miracle. Started at 50 mg then went to 100 and 100 left me feeling sick to my stomach and overall blah. I am taking just 50 and feel better. I feel more in control and stable. Have not had a panic attack since taking this medicine in just less than one week."
