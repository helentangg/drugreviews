"I have been on celexa for a bit over a year to treat my clinical depression which I had for 5 years and general anxiety which I had for 3, and it has literally saved my life. I started with 5mg and worked up to 40mg, and I&#039;ve never felt better than I do after being on celexa. It&#039;s helped me so much, I can finally live and enjoy my life  again"
