"My original post was 10/2/16-had great results immediately on 50mg daily. I am able to hold down a full time job that I love, which was impossible prior to Zoloft. Rarely have anxiety anymore, my relationship with my husband has improved, and the constant &quot;internal storm&quot; is gone. At 51, I finally feel HAPPY!!! Keep trying everyone!"
