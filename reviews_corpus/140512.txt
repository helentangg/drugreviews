"I have been self medicating for years with tramadol. I suffer from anxiety, panic attacks, and depression. I was taking way to much tramadol to cope with life and was spending money I didn&#039;t have to buy it! It&#039;s a miracle that this drug works so great! I was at the point where all I did was sleep and dodge all things social! I&#039;m only on day 3 and I already feel the pre depression me returning! Oh, I also take vistaril when the panic and anxiery really hits! I&#039;ve only taken my 10 mg Lexapro and one 25 mg Vistiral this morning and I feel great! It doesn&#039;t give me the euphoric feeling that tram does but this is so much better! I almost feel normal! If I feel this great already I can only imagine how much better it&#039;ll get!"
