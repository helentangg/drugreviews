"I am in my late 60&#039;s. I have been having awful nights for about a year now, waking frequently with vivid and disturbing dreams that stay with me all day. Doctor prescribed 10mg of Amitriptyline and after just two nights the difference is unbelievable. Last night I slept dreamlessly (well I wasn&#039;t aware of any) for 10 hours, only waking once for the toilet. I feel fine today, although a bit &quot;dopey&quot; for the first hour. Only time will tell if this will last. Does anyone know if it is a drug that can develop dependency and increasing doses?"
