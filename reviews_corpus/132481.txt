"I had suffered an unspeakable event a few months agoIf you think of your worst thought, this was worse. I&#039;ve never been depressed or on any psyc meds in my life. I went about 6 weeks sleeping, perhaps 2 hours per night. I  awakened  with nightmares of the event. I tried Ambien, which made me fall asleep, but I&#039;d only get 3 hours of sleep on a good night, usually less,  awakened by nightmares.  The doc gIve me Doxepin 100mg capsules.  I slept 16 hours straight! I now take 100mg about 30 minutes before bed and sleep 6-8 hours and most importantly,  I don&#039;t have nightmares. I don&#039;t remember any dreams and I don&#039;t have the &quot;Hangover&quot; Ambien gave me. This drug has been a miracle for me literally"
