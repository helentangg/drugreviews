"I have suffered from Burning Mouth Syndrome now for 7 years; it literally possessed my mouth like a fiery demon one day, and I have suffered on and off from it ever since.  After trying numerous ineffective treatments, I was prescribed Amitriptyline (Endep 25) by an oral pathologist. It works to a point, and also helps with the chronic insomnia I have experienced for 10 years.  However, I don&#039;t like taking this drug; I feel like a zombie the next day and it takes a whole day to get over the feeling.  However, I like to keep a supply on hand for when the BMS becomes unbearable; I&#039;ll actually &#039;knock myself out&#039; with Endep to obtain relief when my symptoms are really severe. More research needed urgently into this nightmarish condition!"
