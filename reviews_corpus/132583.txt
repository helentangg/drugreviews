"For fifteen years I only slept 2 to 4 hours each night.  I tried many medications and could not even sleep with barbiturates.  I have been taking Doxepin now for ten years and sleep 7-8 hours each night.  I take a high dose of 150mg.  The downside is constipation and some dizziness.  A worthwhile trade off."
