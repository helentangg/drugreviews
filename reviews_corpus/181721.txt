"Been on Prozac with Zyprexa for over a month now. Can&#039;t tell if its helping but my wife thinks it is so I will give it some more time. Just started taking 40mg yesterday. Hopefully that will do it for me. I&#039;m one who has had major depression/anxiety for over 15 years and all my antidepressants failed on me. I will report back in a week or so. "
