"I had a patient attack me back in 1997 resulting in L shoulder ligament tears, which required surgery.  Months after the surgery my L arm was very painful, cold, the skin hurt to touch it.  I would cry with the pain daily.  After seeing the orthopedic again just before surgery I asked what are you going to do about the cold temperature in my arm.  To this point I had only seen physician assistance.  The MD took one look at my arm, cancelled the surgery for the next day and sent me immediately to see  another Dr in Jacksonville, FL.  This Dr took one look at my arm and knew that moment what it was, RSD reflex sympathetic dystrophy.  They tried several medications and he sent me to a pain specialists.  He stared me on Cymbalta 120 mg daily."
