"After upping dosage to 20 mg my vision started messing up. We lowered it and are titrating off of it now. My vision is still messed up. I can no longer see through my glasses very well. I&#039;m seeing a specialist next week. My head throbs as wee and nausea. My vision better return or someone will be in trouble."
