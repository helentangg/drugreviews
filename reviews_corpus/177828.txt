"I&#039;ve been on Cymbalta for about 8 months now. I never had major side effects to begin with but the last 3 months I&#039;ve been experiencing nightmares or crazy dreams, I&#039;m tired a lot, I sweat at night, I feel as if I&#039;m in one mood and the only major emotion I get is anger. It&#039;s hard to laugh at things that I used to and I can&#039;t cry anymore. Sometimes I just want to feel frustrated when I know I should, and sad, but I feel stuck and emotionless. I don&#039;t think Cymbalta has helped me. I think the only progress I&#039;ve made with my anxiety, OCD, and depression has been on my own."
