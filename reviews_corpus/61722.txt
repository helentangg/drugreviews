"It is pretty awesome. I was really worried I have never taken anything before for anxiety.  The first week was a little up and down I was super nauseous and vomited a couple of times. It has been almost a month and it is now working wonders. I don&#039;t get nearly as flustered or overwhelmed. i would recommend first timers to try this."
