"After months of cbt with my psychologist for severe anxiety and panic disorder i decided to seek help from a psychiatrist. 
I was perscribed 5mg then 10mg of lexapro to start and it gradually incresed to 20mg. 
In the first few days i had never felt worse. More frequant and severe panic attacks and my general anxiety went through the roof and i had the most extreme feeling of hopelessness. I was a mess and calling my drs telling them i needed to stop taking it. They reassured me these side affects would go away within weeks, and they did. I continued with the cbt, mindfullness, lifestyle changes and stayed on the lexapro and within months i felt i was back to my normal self. Post like these kept me going. Hang in there, you&#039;re not alone!"
