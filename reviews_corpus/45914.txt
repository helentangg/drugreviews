"I had many sleepless nights because my mind wouldn&#039;t shut off. A rheumatologist finally tested me for fibromyalgia and I learned I had that, not a sleep disorder per se. I have been taking 20mg of fluoxetine with 10mg of amitriptyline for several years now and have normal sleeping patterns. The only down side I have noticed is that if I skip a dose, the next day I have stomach problems. My doctor said that would happen. Stopping this drug can be done successfully only with a doctor&#039;s supervision."
