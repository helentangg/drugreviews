"I took Effexor for 10 years and found it highly effective controlling anxiety/panic attacks.  After deciding to stop [with Doctor&#039;s approval], I reduced my dosage gradually, and am discontinuing it.  Withdrawal has been rough - like the worst hangover - and I&#039;m into the 5th day but getting better.  However, my mood is still good compared to 10 years ago, and I would like to be medication-free.  Effexor allowed me to control my anxiety/moods through some tough times and through it, I learned new ways to deal with such.  I highly recommend it."
