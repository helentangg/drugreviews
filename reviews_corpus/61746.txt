"I started to get extreme health anxiety and panic attacks out of the blue a little over a month ago. I&#039;ve suffered from anxiety most of my life but always managed my life with it just fine until recently and it became debilitating. I started this medication a little over 3 weeks ago and I am starting to feel so much better. I am eating again, I no longer feel dizzy or lightheaded as much and I am starting to feel like myself again. I only take the lowest dose for now and take it at night and have had no side effects at all. This has been a huge help to me so far."
