"Bad side effects for 2 weeks when starting this medicine. Tolerated it fairly well for a couple months. I was on 50mg, then 100 mg. It did raise my blood pressure. No libido issues like I had when on Efexxor.  It did nothing for my fibromyalgia and it took me a few weeks to stop it. Coming off the Pristiq was was worse than starting it. Very nasty headaches everyday. It also made my hair fall out at an alarming rate. Handfuls. My hair stopped falling out about a month after I stopped the Pristiq."
