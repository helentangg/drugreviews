"Started on 10mg of amitriptyline for my Interstitial Cystitis related nerve pain.  Went up to 20mg after a month and it has been a miracle at reducing my pain for the last six months that I have been on it.  I haven&#039;t experienced any weight gain while on it.  I felt groggy at first but that went away after a few weeks."
