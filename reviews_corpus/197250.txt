"HUGE weight gain!  From 135 lbs up to 205 lbs and there didn&#039;t seem to be any way to lose the weight. I am not an eater, or a snacker, if anything I can&#039;t manage breakfast and I eat a healthy sandwich for lunch and can only manage 1/2 the meal that my husband eats at night.  For me, depression = loss of appetite."
