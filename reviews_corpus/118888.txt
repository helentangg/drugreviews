"Been on Zoloft 25mg a week. It killed my depression (almost) and my anxiety. I&#039;ve been an opiate addict for 6 yrs and only quit 1 week ago. I can&#039;t believe I have no interest in painkillers all of a sudden. Several side effects occurred the first 4 days. Insomnia/ migraines /diarrhea. It&#039;s impressive now though."
