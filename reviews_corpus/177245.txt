"I am 20 years old. I was struggling with anxiety and depression for several years. Both peaked my junior year of college and I found it too much to bear. I went to my family doctor and he prescribed me 30 mg duloxetine. It changed my life in the most positive way. Before I started taking it, I would wake up every morning nauseous from anxiety. I was never at ease, I had the worst self confidence and thoughts of suicide. I was dreading my future. Now, my quality of life has greatly improved. I get excited when I think of what my life will bring. I wake up, and I live life. Things aren&#039;t perfect but compared to where I was 6 months ago, they are incredible. I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s for everyone, but it worked for me and I am so grateful."
