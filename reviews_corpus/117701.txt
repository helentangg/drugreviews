"I began Nortriptyline about one month ago and few side effects so far! I am thrilled to read several peoples experiences have been mostly positive. I still have headaches but nothing I need to run to urgent care for injection. I&#039;ve taken Imitrex as needed for a couple yrs and it stopped working. I noticed lots of posts from people who work in healthcare as I do, very stressful at times. I pray over time I will not have migraines. The Anxiety of them popping up at work is aweful. But these posts stating it works has me much more hopeful! Thanks all-"
