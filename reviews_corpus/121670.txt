"I started taking Effexor XR about two weeks ago on a very low dose.  I am also taking Levbid twice a day.  Between those two, my symptoms are almost non existent.  The doctor wants to raise the dosage next week and I am ok with that since it is supposed to help my anxiety, which is a trigger for my irritable bowel syndrome symptoms.  I will say, the first week, the side effects were horrible.  I had the enlarged pupils, nauseous, constipation, and dizziness.  They went away exactly at the 7 day mark and now I am starting to have hope I can have a normal life once again."
