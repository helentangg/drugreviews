"I started taking 20mg 2 months ago and I noticed a difference after the first week. My issues stemmed from overly panicking about everything and crying hysterically whenever anything small went wrong with my relationship. Soon as the medication started to work I developed more independence. I struggled to cry (I could cry... but after crying a bit, my body/brain stopped me from being able to cry hysterically like I used to). I also found that I cared more about myself and not silly arguments I was having with my partner. Since the medication has worked, if we argue, I&#039;m calm and I realise my worth so much more. I would definitely recommend this medication to anyone who panics or cries unnecessarily. I&#039;ve had no trouble sleeping ever either"
