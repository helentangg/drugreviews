"Cymbalta for me has been very beneficial in treating the anxiety/depression periods of Type 1 Bipolar Disorder.
Some say antidepressant medicines can cause adverse reaction in Bipolar patients leading to Manic episode, but it didn&#039;t with me. It worked better over a long period, the negative effects when first starting the medication, and when stopping, can be quite bad (head spins, nausea, dry mouth, very tired, etc.) and can take a while to subside. I experienced many positive effects after being crippled with depression/anxiety for sometime. Biggest advice - DO NOT STOP TAKING SUDDENLY and DO NOT MISS DOSES. Decrease dosage slowly (speak to your Doctor)."
