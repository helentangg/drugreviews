"33 yr old male suffering from headaches since I can remember.  They&#039;ve gotten worse as I&#039;ve gotten older.  I use Imitrex and Relpax at onset, and this usually takes care of the headache.  I would go through several &quot;stints&quot; where I would wake up with a headache every day .  I am on Propranolol for HBP and migraine maint.).  I tried several other maint. meds like topamax and amitriptyline.  Topamax made my hands tingle.  Amitriptyline didn&#039;t work.   I&#039;ve been on Nortriptyline for 2 months and WOW, what a difference.  The first night I took it, I woke up without a headache.  I probably only get 1 a week now, if that.  Try this med if you haven&#039;t already, maybe it will help you too!"
