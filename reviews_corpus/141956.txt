"I have been on this drug for a year. Initially, it made an amazing difference in my depression and anxiety levels, and allowed me to return to &quot;normal&quot; life. My short temper was back to normal, and I was enjoying many aspects of life again. After a year, the dosage I was on ceased to be effective (10mg) and the side effects more worrisome. I have gained nearly 20lbs with no increase in calorie intake and have in fact improved my diet and reduced calorie intake, and in fact am working out 5 days a week for an hour of hardcore bootcamp-style exercise...and have not lost a pound. At this time I am so uncomfortable with the weight gain and the absolute absence of libido that I am considering moving to Wellbutrin or other antidepressant."
