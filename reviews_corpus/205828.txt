"I have been on many antidepressants for depression and anxiety. I have suffered with this for years, and I just started Pristiq today. Already I feel like I am more awake and can concentrate better. I am on 50 mg extended release tablets. I hope that it helps me more in the days to come to feel even better. So far it seems to have helped even though I just took it today!"
