"I have been taking amitriptyline for 3 months now - I take 10mg morning and night due to how severe my irritable bowel syndrome is.

I can eat everything now and have no side effects - I used to have diarrhea, bloating, stomach cramps &amp; bad gas every time I ate gluten, dairy, spicy foods, onion, garlic and coffee (I&#039;ve suffered from IBS for 8 years)

This medicine has changed my life."
