"Back again to post another update.  Going on week 6 of citalopram.  Started on 10mg.  Felt I needed to boost it up to 20mg.   Things have been going great!  Haven&#039;t had a panic attack in over a week now.  I haven&#039;t experienced any side effects.  Just amazed.  Still happy I had courage to give this medication a chance.
Best wishes.  Panic and anxiety are awful to experience."
