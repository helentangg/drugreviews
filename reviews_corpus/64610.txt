"So far Zoloft has proven to be very helpful. I gave it the rating I did because it&#039;s only been two weeks on it. I have had 2 panic attacks today but so far so good. The Zoloft did keep them from going full blown. It&#039;s like I just all of a sudden began to calm down. I still feel a little anxious but I definitely have energy now. I started out on 25mg and then increased to 50mg the following week. I do have excessive yawning and some fatigue but overall this medicine is awesome. The doctors decided to try me on this because one day I just woke up and began to have panic attacks and they continually got worse. I was on Celexa 20mg which didn&#039;t help at all with anxiety. The reviews on this page definitely gives me hope to continue using  this."
