"My doctor wanted me to try an antidepressant. After several years of being non-compliant with my psychiatrist I agreed to try this drug with a new doctor. She started me on 10mg. It&#039;s only been 6 days and I&#039;ve noticed a marked difference in my thinking and how I feel. Most of all my negative thoughts have stopped. I&#039;m not sitting at home feeling paranoid or angry about anything, I don&#039;t get rage fits over little things since I started, I am able to get over anger so easy like within a couple of minutes versus 2 days. I feel more energetic. I feel rested when I wake up. 

I just had some nausea the first day which was bad. The nausea has subsided. I can&#039;t wait to see how I feel in 5-7 more weeks :). Thankyou science"
