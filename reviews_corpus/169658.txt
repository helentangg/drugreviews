"I was prescribed this for breakthrough pain, but it did not help it at all. I also got severely depressed the first day I started taking it, and it did not let up.  However, the one thing it did help with was my MAV (migraine associated vertigo)!  Immediately after taking it, I was no longer dizzy!  Every day I took this, I wasn&#039;t dizzy and could actually function normally.  I would have stayed on it for this reason but the depression was too much.  My sleep specialist also almost prescribed this for my insomnia but I was already on other antidepressants at the time.  I&#039;m no longer on any of those (It was PMDD the entire time) but still this wouldn&#039;t have helped anyway (like every other sleep medicine I&#039;ve tried)."
