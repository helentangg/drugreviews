"I&#039;ve titrated from 5mgs to 10mgs over a month. I&#039;m still on Seroquel and Rivotril. The Brintillex definitely causes tummy issues, between nausea and severe indigestion/heartburn which exacerbates my asthma. So I&#039;m trying different times to take it. The one suggestion is to take it with your biggest meal. And as someone has said earlier it seems that certain foods do make the nausea worse."
