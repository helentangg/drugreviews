"I am a 26 year old female.  I started Lexapro 10 mg a week ago.  I have experienced nausea, dry mouth, headaches and fatigue.  Rated it a 7 because I don&#039;t think I have been taking it long enough to notice any huge differences.  I do feel maybe slightly more calm and a little less blushing.  Here&#039;s hoping things get even better!"
