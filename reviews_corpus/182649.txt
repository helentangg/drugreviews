"All I can say is try it and don&#039;t take all reviews at face value - not everyone has brain zaps and puts on a ton of weight because everyone is different. All I know is I suffered from major anxiety and depression (tried to get by without meds for some time).  I had fluoxetine and citalopram - the first only helped with depression and the second gave me heart palps.  Now on cymbalta I am feeling normal and wake up refreshed and ready to face the day. The first week was a bit crazy, felt like on a bad trip. Then felt great for a week, then low again for two and now I am fine (Taken them for about 8 weeks now).  I also have the motivation now to lose weight which I have done so I am fairly optimistic. 8 stars because haven&#039;t taken it long term yet."
