"I have only been on Pristiq for 2 days, and my depression has lifted almost instantly. I have more energy and am not as hungry. It does affect sleep though. I remedy this by taking it at 5:30 or 6:00 AM. I have treatment resistant major depression, so you name the anti-depressant, and I&#039;ve tried it. This is a miracle drug."
