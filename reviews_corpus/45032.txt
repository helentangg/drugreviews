"I&#039;m on week 6 of Prozac and it saved my life. I went through a semester of major life changes (engagement, graduation, moving across country, major weight gain from stress, living with fiancee&#039;s parents, and stopped being able to see my friends) which resulted in me becoming severely depressed. I&#039;ve NEVER been depressed in my life I&#039;m the most bubbly person ever. Well when I started to get into a deep black hole and also having suicidal ideation (never had before) I decided to go to the doctor. She started me on 10mg for 4 weeks and with some change (75% better) we decided to try 20mg for 100%. I&#039;m only on week 6 of being on prozac all together and it saved my life, my relationship and my joy. PLEASE give it time. I&#039;m praying for you all!"
