"I&#039;ve been on Pristiq about a month now. Before that I was taking Lexapro for over a year. So far I like the Pristiq much better. Both worked to keep the anxiety and panic attacks away but with Lexapro I gained 20lbs and had zero energy. All I wanted to do was eat and sleep. With Pristiq I have tons of energy! I no longer want to lay in bed all day. I don&#039;t have much of an appetite so I&#039;m hoping I can finally lose the weight I gained from Lexapro. I&#039;m very happy I switched to Pristiq and hope it continues to work for me.
