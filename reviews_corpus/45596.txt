"I&#039;ve been on Prozac since April 2011. Before that I was on Lexapro for 5 years. Lexapro helped with my depression, but did nothing for my anxiety.

I have post traumatic stress disorder, and a side effect of PTSD is obsessive compulsive disorder, anxiety, depression, trichotillomania and binge eating.

Prozac has almost eliminated all of that. No more depression, very mild anxiety. My OCD and trichotillomania are under control. 
I have also lost 50 lbs but I do not know if this is because of the medication.

The only side effect I experienced was being trapped in nightmares. This only happened the first month I started."
