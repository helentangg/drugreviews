"I&#039;ve been on this medicine for almost ten years. At first it helped me and now I think I am having the long term side effects of the drug. My anxiety is through the roof and I have gained 50 lbs in 6 months. I&#039;m not depressed but have major anxiety, I would say I have a panic attack almost every day. I take 60 MG and was on 80 but had to lower it because I was getting bad chest pain. I&#039;m thinking about going off of it because the anxiety is so bad I can&#039;t stand it hardly. I guess for short term use it is a good drug but long term use it sucks, everybody is different though."
