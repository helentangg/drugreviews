"Ok so I&#039;ve had anxiety/depression for over 20 years. I&#039;ve tried Prozac, amitriptyline, citalopram, and sertraline. 
Sertraline has totally changed my life. I struggled with the side effects of the other meds mentioned and felt disconnected and zoned out at times, so much so I couldn&#039;t continue with them. However sertraline does still have its side effects, on first taking it increased my anxiety and so took diazepam for the first few weeks. I had a dry mouth at first but this has settled. 
I now have  a normal sleep pattern and have the energy to play with my children, do housework and can leave the house without fear of being looked at it or even spoken to. 
Its all trial and error, I&#039;m on dose 100mg daily I&#039;m late 30s female.
