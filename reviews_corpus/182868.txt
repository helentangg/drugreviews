"Be careful when taking this medication. I took my first tablet yesterday in the morning and started feeling unwell during the day. Was out at a restaurant for lunch and started feeling so nauseous and burst into tears, and had to leave before my food arrived. Went home and felt so sick I slept for a couple of hours. Woke up and had some food, thought I was starting to feel better but a couple hours after that I collapsed (luckily I was at home with family) and was vomiting and had a severe fever, can&#039;t put into words just how horrible I was feeling. Woke up still feeling sick, of course didn&#039;t take another tablet, and am starting to feel better now about 38 hours after taking the tablet."
