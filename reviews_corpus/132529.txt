"Low dose doxepin did not help at all with my insomnia.  I tried doses from 5mg to 20mg and it never helped with either falling asleep or staying asleep.  Side effects:  very dry mouth, sore throat, headache.  On the plus side it&#039;s very inexpensive and I was able to discontinue it without any withdrawal effects."
