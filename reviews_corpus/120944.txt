"This is the only medication I have ever taken that I completely regret. I have been on at least six different medications for major depression. I gradually went up to a 225mg dose. I had horrible withdrawals from a missed dose, I would become dizzy and light headed half way through the day I missed a dose. I could barely leave my bed with how sick I would feel from withdrawals. I have moderate anxiety that became amplified on this drug. I became paranoid and had major anxiety attacks. I also started to have uncontrollable tics that interfered with my daily routine. And lastly, I gained more weight and I&#039;m having difficulty loosing it. Now I am slowly being taken off the drug and I am miserable, I am so sick from the withdrawals."
