"I started on 50mg but I just felt the same, depressed and anxious, then after 3 weeks the doc put me on 100mg, been on that for 3 weeks and I feel even worse, crying all the time, not wanting to socialise, hate my life, the doc said to keep it going. But I seriously can&#039;t cope with these thoughts and tears, I was escitalopram 20mg for 5 years and they worked, but they are costly, and doc was trying to get me off them, I don&#039;t know what to do, I know it&#039;s only been weeks, but I don&#039;t think I can carry on feeling like this"
