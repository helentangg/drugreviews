"I did fine on this drug until I started the 40mg.  It actually took me awhile to figure out that it was the Vybrid because I had been doing fine on the 10,20, and 30 mg doses.  After starting the 40 mg, I began having horrible dreams where I could not remember a lot of the detail but I knew they were bad because I would wake up terrified and it would sometimes take me a few days to be my normal self again.   It was recognizable by my family too.  I would also have hallucinations right after I went to bed and I was unable to make them stop.  I would also think I was screaming in bed when I wasn&#039;t.  I am currently being weaned off of it.  It was a very scary drug for me."
