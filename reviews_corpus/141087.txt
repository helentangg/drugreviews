"I have been on escitalopram 10 mg for 3 months now. The first month was very rough, side effects were nauseous and major increased anxiety. I did occasionally take a low dose of Klonopin for the increased anxiety which really helped. After about 7-8 weeks I saw a huge improvement in my anxiety. I have not gained any weight and sleep very well,( I take it at night before bed). Wow. I finally feel back to myself. These reviews got me through the first month! Definitely stick it out and know that your body will adjust to the medicine! I will occasionally feel a little anxious but it passes quickly and I can cope so much better! Am so grateful that this is working and that I can enjoy my life again!!!"
