"I was suffering from severe depression to the brink I was suicidal, finally I sought help and was perscribed lexapro. I felt very nauseous soon after and within a few hours I was in the height of terrifying panic  so much so I begged to be locked up because I was so scared, horrendous hallucinations and I felt like my skin was on fire. I suffered vomiting and diarrhoea for 3 days and basically hid in my room for a number of weeks after.  This was from taking one tablet and have since been diagnosed with GAD which I did not have before.  I&#039;m currently trying reiki yoga counselling and meditation and know I need extta help but I have such a fear after that reaction I don&#039;t think I could survive another episode.  Never again"
