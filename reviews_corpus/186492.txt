"I&#039;ve taken many antidepressant over the past 15 years.  Prozac, Celexa, Lexapro, Cymbalta as well as Wellbutrin.  I never had any worrisome side effects until Pristiq.  With Pristiq, my normal blood pressure increased by 40 points within a couple of days.  I went back to using Lexapro and my blood pressure went back to normal."
