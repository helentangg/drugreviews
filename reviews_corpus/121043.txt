"I ran out of my medicine for about 5 days.  I started getting these extremely strange noises in my head,  something like the noise a squirrel makes or an electrical static noise.  As soon as I started back on my pills it went away.  Today I didn&#039;t take my medicine on time,  8 hours later I took it, but the noise reminded me.  Someone please explain this to me."
