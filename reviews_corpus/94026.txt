"This is an evil little pill!  The first time I took it, I became very irritable.  The second day, I was so angry that I screamed at my children for the smallest things.  The third day, I start to itch all over and got a headache.  The fourth day, I was so volatile that I screamed at anyone who dared look at me.  I called my doctor who told me to push through.  The anger became so bad, that I thought I was going to hurt someone.  I&#039;ve never reacted like that to any medication and quite frankly, it scared me and my family.

As soon as I went off of it, didn&#039;t even wean myself off, my mood started to even out some."
