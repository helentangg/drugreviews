"I started taking 20mgs of Lexapro every day 3 months ago. I have experienced the sexual side effects and lethargy associated with it, but it has served as a good mood stabilizer. In fact, it actually helped me to quit drinking. I had developed a daily routine with alcohol and had trouble stopping cold turkey. I needed something. I let the Lexapro work and after two weeks I lost my craving. That isn&#039;t to say it cures alcoholism or depression, but it&#039;s been just the assist I needed. I combine my medication with some therapy and self-help audio books. I&#039;m in a much better place now than ever before. I strongly encourage anyone to give the medicine a chance to work."
