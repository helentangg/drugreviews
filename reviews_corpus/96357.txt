"This may sound weird, but I started Zoloft for depression almost 2 1/2 months ago, and I&#039;m still severely depressed. However, I have noticed that it has helped me with a little something I now realized were panic attacks (haven&#039;t told the therapist or the psychiatrist about them). I went off the Zoloft for 5 days and all hell broke loose. I&#039;ve been back on it and I realize that I&#039;m very chill now. I don&#039;t freak out at every little thing and don&#039;t curl up in the corner of my room sobbing about meaningless things and things I can never change. So for panic disorder, I give it a high score. Depression, ..not so much. Oh, and it definitely helps with OCD too. I think I became OCD in some of my panics."
