"I started taking 10mg prozac last Tuesday so it&#039;s been a week and a half and the first few days I was tired but I seem to be doing things here and there that I&#039;d put off for a while and things I don&#039;t normally feel like doing. That is encouraging and makes me think it&#039;s working. I&#039;ve had a lot of losses in my life in the last 10 years and also going through menopause which is adding to my depression and general bad feeling. My husband also gambled away my inheritance from my mom and my kids college money that his dad left for them. I just can&#039;t believe he did that and it&#039;s something I struggle with every day since we&#039;re not super financially stable. I hope this medicine continues to work better every day. I&#039;ve been told it takes 2-4 weeks"
