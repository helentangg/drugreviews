"Dr. started me on Endep 2 months ago for chronic pain in the long bones caused by side effects from Chronic Myaloid Leukaemia medication. It&#039;s the first time in nine years that I have felt &quot;almost&quot; normal! 
It makes me tired so I take it at night. The only drawback is dry mouth and loss of taste. The taste thing is driving me up the wall, and I don&#039;t know that I can live with it. So now I have to weigh up the pros &amp; cons of living without tasting my food, or living without pain."
