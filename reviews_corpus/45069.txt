"This is a great medicine.  I switched to this after taking lexapro and having some difficult-to-manage side effects.  I did not have any side effects at all on Prozac in the beginning.  I have noticed that recently I have more of an appetite. I monitor what I eat so I haven&#039;t gained weight but it is more of a challenge.  My sister is also on the same dose but has not had the hunger side effect."
