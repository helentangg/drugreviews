"I was so happy to find a site that allowed  me to understand the &quot;brain zaps&quot;, headaches, nausea and light sensativity I was getting. I thought it was some kind of migraine or a brain tumor. I have been on 175 MG for some years and my anger and depression  are improved greatly but like some others if I  am even a few hours  late with my pill the side effects  start . I know I need to wean off but am scared to death of the withdrawal."
