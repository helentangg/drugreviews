"I absolutely loved Prozac. It helped me immensely! I noticed an extremely positive change in my mood and behavior after my body adjusted to the medication.

Friends and family were surprised to hear that I was even on medication because of how relaxed and happy my disposition became. I&#039;m happy I gave it a chance.

I built my way up to 60 mg a day for almost a year. However, my body has become used to it over time and I&#039;m having to change medications."
