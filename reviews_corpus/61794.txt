"I was having a lot of trouble sleeping due to constant hot flashes for months. I felt exhausted all day and at night fall asleep then wide awake an hour later kicking covers off and on. Dr. recommended low dosage and after a few jittery days I was sleeping most of the night and feeling rested in the morning. It&#039;s been almost a month and I am so happy to have found something that works. No more expensive supplements that don&#039;t even work."
