"I have been on Nortriptyline for 3 months now and I couldn&#039;t be happier. I have been suffering with migraines since I was 16 and I am now 31. I have been on a number of medicines for prevention but this is the first time I can say that my migraines are under control. After being on this for 2 months I missed 2 days and woke up to a horrible migraine. Since then I have been right back on and not missing any dosages. If you haven&#039;t tried this for migraines and are still suffering I highly recommend you talk to your doctor about it."
