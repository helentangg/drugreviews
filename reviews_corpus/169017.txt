"At the age of 24 I started taking Lexapro which did absolutely nothing.  Then I started taking Zoloft which did the trick except I gained weight and had absolutely no sex drive which was causing serious issues in my marriage.  Just a couple months ago I started taking Viibryd to help with the sexual side effects.  It worked, I felt fine.  Until now, I have been on Viibryd for about two months and take 40mg a day.  I feel like it just stopped working.  The past two weeks have been torture.  I think I will go back to the Zoloft and deal with the side effects.  Not to mention my insurance doesn&#039;t cover Viibryd so it costs about $158 a month out of pocket."
