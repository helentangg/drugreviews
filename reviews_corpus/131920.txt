"I love it. It&#039;s so much better than the other 2 I tried that made me feel like a zombie and had side effects.  Effexor XR has helped me and still does help me to not have the anxiety/panic attacks that I was experiencing before.  It&#039;s the best by far.  I highly recommend Effexor XR for anyone with bad anxiety &amp; panic attacks.  It&#039;s absolutely the best."
