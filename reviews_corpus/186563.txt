"I&#039;ve been on Pristiq for a little of a year and a half now. It has helped with my anxiety amazingly but I have gained 20 pounds from it. I&#039;ve done everything to get it off. I have always eaten healthy and I work out regularly. I cannot get off of it because then my anxiety will come back.  My doctor recommends I go to a dietitian to help me with this problem.  I was also on Lexapro for a year before this and it made me gain weight as well. All I want is for an anxiety medicine. That does not have this side effect but my doctor tells me there is none."
