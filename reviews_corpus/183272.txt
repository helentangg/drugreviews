"Cymbalta is a pretty potent antidepressant. After being on high dose Wellbutrin (450mg) with high dose Effexor XR (450mg) I was switched to Cymbalta. Since I&#039;d developed treatment refractory depression, after 3 weeks with no results (and horrible side effects) I asked to be bumped up from 60mg to 90mg. After another 2 weeks, I went to 120mg.  This triggered my first hypomanic episode in my 30-something years.  Scaled back down to 60mg and what do you know, this time it worked.  Give Cymbalta a chance to work, don&#039;t rush it. It may take longer than the usual 3 weeks, but when it works, it&#039;s worth it."
