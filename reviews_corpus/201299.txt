"I&#039;ve been suffering with depression coupled with anxiety for over 10 years.  Its been hell ruining every aspect of my life (loss of relationships, my business etc.) After seeing so many psychiatrists I had lost hope and was getting very close to ending my life so tried to get help one more time.  For the first time I met a young Doctor who listened.  He prescribed me Zoloft 50mg.  The change = I left my house within 2 weeks (major agoraphobia for 8 months) started talking to people, going out again with friends, preparing to launch my business again and I feel happy. Not manic, HAPPY and measured. I&#039;m praying that I stay this way.  There is hope out there. Don&#039;t give up guys. :)"
