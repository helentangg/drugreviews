"I have depression since 2007 and already have three relapses till now. For my first treatment, I was given Lexapro and as most anti-depressants it took around 3-4 weeks for this drug to fully take effect. Side effect to me was minor eg. dizziness, loss of appetite. With a combination of exercise. I did recover although not fully, after 1 year. On my 2nd relapses (failed biz investment), I was again given Lexapro, nothing new to me and the drug itself took effect fast and I felt better after around 3 weeks and move on to a new job. Recently due some persistent health problems (stomach ache), my depression again came back. I saw my doctor and again given Lexapro. The effect was good and felt better within 2 weeks and now I try to exercise 4 times a week."
