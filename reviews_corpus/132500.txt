"I was put on Doxepin 10mg, for wake up middle of night insomnia. Every time I&#039;ve taken it( about 5), I&#039;m knocked out and sleep heavy for about 9 hrs. Then I&#039;m very groggy the next day and sleep off and on. The feeling rested and like I actually slept is great. But, it&#039;s almost too good. I&#039;m going to ask my dr. To reduce to like 3mg."
