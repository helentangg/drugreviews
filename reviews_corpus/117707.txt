"In the last year I have been having &quot;complex&quot; migraines with auras and numbness in arms/legs/face and that are so bad I cannot speak or move. I was taking Excedrine but It wasn&#039;t helping much at all.  Because of the numbness and auras I was very limited to which medicines I could take. Lucky for me nortriptyline was the first one I was prescribed. I was getting migraines 4/5 times a week and it was REALLY getting in the way of my life. Within the first 2 weeks the migraines stopped!! I didn&#039;t get one again until 3 months of being on nortriptyline and it was a mild headache that I managed perfectly with Excedrine! Now I manage about one headache a month with Excedrine and take 30mg of nortriptyline daily before bed. Only side effect I have is hair loss."
