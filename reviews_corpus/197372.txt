"When my doctor asked me how I felt my Paxil 20mg was working (after being in Wellbutrin unsuccessfully for two  years) I could only explain it as &quot;someone finally washed both sides of the windows&quot;. Other medicines (Zoloft) helped with some anxiety but left me still depressed. Still others (Celexa) helped with the depression but the anxiety was left uncontrolled. I finally feel like I am back on track to take control of my life. I am pretty sure some dosage adjustments still need to be done, but I am amazed at the past four months on Paxil and what a difference it has made. The minor OCD I was experiencing is gone, the anxiety is a minimum and the depression no longer rules every day. I wish I would have done this for myself and my family years ago."
