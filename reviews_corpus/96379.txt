"Thank God for Zoloft! I wish I knew about depression decades ago! For the first time in years I see the world in color, have patience and actually care. Zoloft makes me a better me, a better parent and better person.  I take 100 mg in the morning and 100 mg at night.  NO SIDE EFFECTS! Sure wish I had weight loss, though!  A smidge of loss of interest in sex, but can still enjoy."
