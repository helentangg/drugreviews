"Just wanted to thank you everyone who took their time to write these reviews. I was adamant I was going to overcome anxiety by myself but I lost more and more control. Lived in the constant fear of it and was obsessed. My life has been literally on hold for the last 8 weeks and my husband and children have suffered from it too. After reading your reviews yesterday I took my first Lexapro, didn&#039;t think it would work for a few weeks but actually the effect was pretty immediate, about an hour after taking it I went out and suddenly realized the world, the color, the people everything looked like it used too! Very little side effects so far, only dry mouth and poor appetite. So far so good."
