"I&#039;m writing this review because I&#039;m absolutely shocked by how quickly I began to feel like myself again. After as little as a week I had an easier time getting out of bed in the morning, I physically felt more energetic, and I had more emotional clarity. My husband is even more delighted in the results than I am. He says I&#039;m more like myself. Even with good insurance this medicine can be pricey. Very few side effects. I felt a little jittery the first couple of days and had trouble sleeping. Those went away when I adjusted the time I took the medicine. I&#039;m just thankful to feel some relief!"
