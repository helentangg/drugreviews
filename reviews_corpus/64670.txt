"This medicine was definitely not for me.
The first two nights I got horrible migraines, and I had more trouble falling and staying asleep. Then I had difficulty urinating (I know it isn&#039;t a listed side effect, but once I got off it the problem stopped) I wouldn&#039;t be able to use the bathroom even when I had to go for ten to twelve hours, it was very strange. Will not take again."
