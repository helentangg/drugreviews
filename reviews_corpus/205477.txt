"I was originally on Prozac 20mg for my depression.  I found the Prozac helpful, but emotionally numbing.  I am participating in psychotherapy and it got to the point that I couldn&#039;t really access my feelings and it was interfering with my therapy. I spoke to my doctor and he switched me to Pristiq 50mg. I found that it was easy to adjust to (some nighttime sweating but that&#039;s about it).  It gives me very good control of my depression.  My irritability is also very well controlled.  However, I am now able to access my feelings when I need to (such as in therapy) and I feel less numb. I am still able to manage stress just as well as when I was on Prozac, yet I don&#039;t feel so disconnected from the world and from myself."
