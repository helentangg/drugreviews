"I&#039;m on brintellix for month and a half now. I&#039;ve also been using valdoxan for three months, but it didn&#039;t give any significant effect so I&#039;ve started taking brintellix 10 mg and after three weeks I felt an effect. It seems like I&#039;m getting better every day. My mood, energy level and motivation have increased, my suicidal thoughts are gone and I am finally able to cope with my every day responsibilities."
