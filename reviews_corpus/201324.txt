"I&#039;ve been suffering from manic depression and anxiety since I was a teenager. I came to my breaking point last month and finally sought professional help. I&#039;m now on day 3 with taking Zoloft 25mg twice daily and I&#039;ve noticed some difference already and it&#039;s for the better. 
I&#039;m not really experiencing the side effects everyone is talking about and I&#039;m sleeping just fine. I was a little sleepy the first day and body was a little sore but nothing like everyone is describing. I know its  only been day 3 so its not really in my system. So I&#039;ll check in in a few weeks. Wish me luck"
