"I&#039;ve successfully taken Lexapro, also Effexor, and Wellbutrin w/each (did not gain weight on either of these) for last 15 years. Tried Cymbalta--did not help depression &amp; gave me nightmares. Now on day 7 of taking Viibryd. First 4-5 days had nausea &amp; constant mild headache. Did have a few instances while driving of &quot;when did I switch to this lane?&quot; Last night had first strange, vivid dream. Yesterday felt a little bloated, but things going ok so far. I know all antidepressants have an adjustment period w/side effects. It&#039;s interesting to see how same drug effects people so differently. Not sure if depression is getting better, but wouldn&#039;t know yet b/c work extremely stressful last 5 weeks, so we&#039;ll see as work winds down--I&#039;m very hopeful!"
