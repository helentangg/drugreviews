"Did not work for me. Was having some side effects from Zoloft, so I went to my MD to change things around a bit.  Zoloft was the only thing I had ever been on, but the tiredness and no libido was getting in the way of my children and marriage.  My doctor put me on Cymbalta and at first I thought that I was really going to like it. I felt more energetic and definitely more patient with my husband and children. BUT then I started getting anxious off and on, which gradually got worse until I couldn&#039;t stand it any more.  Now I&#039;m trying a different SNRI, Pristiq.  Time will tell, but Cymbalta was definitely not for me."
