"My depression began at 14, with low self esteem &amp; deep insecurities, but I was very friendly &amp; popular.   At 25, I took Prozac for 1 year (didn&#039;t like), then diagnosed with major ADD at 28.  Adderall was a lifesaver, but after 15 years, still dealing with depression - especially seasonal. I was prescribed Celexa 2 yrs ago and it has worked wonders - keeps me feeling normal, happy and steady.   BUT it makes me break out in sweat episodes 1-2 x a day.   Uncomfortable. I thought it was pre-menopausal or hormone related (friends &amp; OBGYN thought so too).  Finally figured out it is more likely a side-effect of Celexa. (Could be dosage amount, 50mg?)  I am just now switching to Wellbutrin &amp; hope it&#039;s better.
