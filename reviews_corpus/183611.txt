"I have been taking this for 3 yrs now mainly for the Fibro, but also due to the depression and neuropathy that I suffer from The Rhabdomyolisis due to Pravachol use.  The depression is way under control, and the nerve pain also  better. I still get muscle cramping and joint pain daily.  Works great for me and now my insurance company wants to substitute it!  "
