"When I first took Effexor I was in the first few days a bit jittery, but then I felt like I hadn&#039;t felt in years or ever. It was such a God send. Then with doctors advice after approx 12 mths I went off it.  I went on it two more times,  but my dose was higher and higher- no real help to me. Then a third time, I went off my head on it. The anxiety was woeful, so severe. I phoned up the help line for mental health and got the usual spiel- give it time, yes, it can cause that, speak with you doctor and so on. I read how this can happens then wamo it works. But I had already been on it before and never had such side effects.  It was horrible, and scary.  My personal experience is two opposites. Good and horrible."
