"I have been on Cymbalta for several months and found that 60 mg is very helpful for sleep and some pain relief.  I still have flare-ups, but they don&#039;t seem to last as long.  I have not experienced the &quot;Fibro Fog&quot; while on this medication.   I have lost some weight.  My energy levels have not improved, I get periods of numbness in fingers and toes, but that is attributable to my spinal damage."
