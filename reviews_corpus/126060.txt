"I&#039;ve been on Viibryd 20mg for about 2 weeks. The side effects were rough at first, to the point I wanted to quit. There&#039;s no major markers to show that my depression is lifted, but I&#039;m not sad all the time anymore. The big change for me, is not that I have extra energy, but I don&#039;t feel like I&#039;m being weighed down. I have patience with my 2 yr old. If the effects peak at 8 weeks, I can&#039;t wait. I&#039;m very happy."
