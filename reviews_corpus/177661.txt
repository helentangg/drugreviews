"Amazing! Best depression &amp; anxiety medication I have been on &amp; I have tried many. Horrible initial side effects but after 2 weeks subsided. Without a doubt completely worth it. Anxiety &amp; depression dramatically diminished, libido back with a vengeance :) HIGHLY recommended from a person with a long history of acute anxiety &amp; depression which was made worse by not being able to find a suitable medication until now. Best 6 months ever."
