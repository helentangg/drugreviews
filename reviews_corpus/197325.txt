"I have always had a depressive nature, increasing at middle age. I went on to Paroxetine 10mg, after a particularly stressful time at work. After about 6 weeks of ups and downs, things stabilized for me and my depression subsided to almost nothing. Of particular interest to me was that my social awareness disorder also reduced dramatically. Often at meetings, where I&#039;d now speak up without hesitation, I would think to myself &quot;hey, is this really me?&quot;
Unfortunately my depression prevailed, possibly because of my long term Type 2 diabetes. As a stressful period arose, I upped my dose to 20mg. It seemed to help for a little while. My lower than expected rating is because of how difficult it is to get off this, even to reduce the dosage."
