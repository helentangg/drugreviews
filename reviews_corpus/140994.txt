"Started on 10mg for 2 nights and severe panic and not sleeping. Dr dropped it to 5 mg and added xanax to help anxiety and started taking it in the morning. Cannot sleep even with the xanax although they help quickly with the anxiety. Feel extremely tired during the afternoon and evening but still unable to sleep. Feel like body is rushing am struggling whether to stay on them just wondering will this eventually stop? I have been reading theses forums for help."
