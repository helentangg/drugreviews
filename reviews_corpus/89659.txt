"I began this medicine a year ago and have been stable at one dosage, 40 mg, for 7 months. I have experienced a large weight gain of 20 lbs on my small frame and have become very unhappy. I trusted my physician when I chose this medication. He told me it is one of the only SSRI&#039;s that does not cause weight gain. I feel all the positive side effects I first experienced have faded. I am going to be going off the medication this week with hopes of losing the weight. Gaining so much weight for a young girl is counterproductive when considering what the medication is originally prescribed for. I am a 23 yr old female."
