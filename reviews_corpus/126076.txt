"I have had very good results with Viibryd except that I think my memory is getting worse since I started this medicine. I haven&#039;t seen that mentioned anywhere as a side effect, and it may just be that I am getting older.  I used to have a GREAT memory, what I called my best asset and worst fault at the same time, and I speak five languages, which is kind of a special class for an American."
