"Rheumatologist put me on Cymbalta for fibromyalgia.  I started on the medication, 20 mg, I think.  I worked at a bank at the time and 1 week into taking it I was having anxiety attacks at work.  I had anxiety before this but not in social situations like this.  I stayed on it for another week or so but took myself off.  She also put me on amitriptine  for muscle relaxation at night.  First it knocked me the heck out, then within 2 wks I would wake up with bad cramps in my legs and such tension/contraction in all my muscles that I couldn&#039;t sleep. Weaned myself off of that too. Told Dr what happened, she said it wasn&#039;t the medicine causing the symptoms.  Right..  10 months later still have anxiety, voice is shaky, not working."
