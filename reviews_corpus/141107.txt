"It works really good. I also have anxiety and for the most part it helps. I still get anxious but that&#039;s just a part of life. 
Only thing about this medication I don&#039;t like is that it&#039;s very addictive. Not in the way you need to take it and take more of it like pain pills but rather, if you miss a doss or run out and are unable to fill it you will go through withdrawals. Neurological withdrawals, which are awful. 
So always make sure you get your refills on time!"
