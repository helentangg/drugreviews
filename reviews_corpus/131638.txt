"No pill is for everyone, but this medication honestly changed my life. I am 23 and have been on it since I was 17. Before it, I was miserable, couldn&#039;t focus, and constantly wanted to die. I struggle with GAD and Depression, and this medication has honestly been the only thing to make it bearable. My life feels manageable, and I know I can conquer anything. I interact with people in a way that represents who I really am, not in a way that reflects my anxieties and insecurities.  I almost didn&#039;t finish high school before Effexor and I now have a BA in Political Science and am heading off to law school.  Like I said, this medication isn&#039;t for everyone, but it honestly changed my life and I will forever be grateful."
