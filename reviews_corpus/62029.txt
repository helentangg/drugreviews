"I&#039;ve only been on Celexa for 5 days. I understand that this will not be an entirely accurate review of the medicine, because it takes about 4 weeks to get the full effect, but my experience is worth sharing for those just starting.

Reason for being prescribed:
-anxiety associated with emotional stress
-depression (seasonal)
-inability to sleep due to anxiety
-panic attacks (only about 5 in a 2 month period)

Days 1-2: 10 mg - felt awful. I felt anxious, foggy-headed, weird...
Day 3: I was quiet, but full of energy. Some trouble sleeping (woke up in the middle of the night)
Day 4: Tired because I didn&#039;t sleep well that night. Midday exhaustion. Somewhat antisocial. Still &quot;myself&quot; though.
Day 5: General good mood, positive. Productive.  "
