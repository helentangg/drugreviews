"I was on Cymbalta for almost 2 years. I stopped taking it because I thought it was the reason why I was gaining weight (10 lbs over 1 year). 30 mg first year, then 60 mg, then 30 mg again
Pros: It treated my fibro! Not just temporary effect, 80% of the pain went away!
I stopped taking it 1.5 years ago and the no-pain effect is still here. Pretty happy about that.
Cons: the adjusting period (about 2 weeks) IS a nightmare, worst vertigo and nausea ever.
Overall, highly recommended to people with fibromyalgia."
