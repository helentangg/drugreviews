"Had extreme anxiety, panic attacks, couldn&#039;t ever sleep and excessive worrying.  Lexapro helped immediately I went from 10 mg to eventually 20mg it helped so much but I gained about 15 lbs.  I craved sweets and carbs all the time!  My Dr. told me to try to go back to 10mg but then I became very irritable, so I went back to 20mg for months.  Just last night I tried 15mg...Wow!  My appetite is normal, no food binges, no sleepy fog, no anxiety, and my energy already feels normal!!  It is only the first day, but I am hoping this dose is my permanent one.  Before Lexapro I was getting a lot of OCD type scary thoughts that would not leave my mind-made me feel like I was going crazy and now my Dr. discovered I have a genetic factor.
