"Cymbalta was the first drug that actually improved the diabetic neuropathy pain I was experiencing in my legs, feet, arms and hands.  For the first time, I was able to sleep through the night without waking in tears from the pain.  I was so happy my doctor put me on this drug in conjunction with Neurontin.  The pain almost disappeared!  Approximately 6-8 weeks later, I noticed that the neuropathy pain started back up again despite continuing on the medicines.  I too, had insomnia making it difficult, at best, to be alert, focused or have any energy the following day.  To this day, I still have some insomnia and an increase in the neuropathy symptoms; BUT Cymbalta 60mg &amp; Neurontin 600mg are the BEST drugs so far in lessening the pain."
