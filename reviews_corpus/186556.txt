"I have been on Pristiq for 4 months now. Having never been treated for any kind of depression or mood disorder I wasn&#039;t sure what to expect.  The first 2 months I was at 50mg, had few side effects of headache and nausea but those subsided and I was generally feeling just not happy.. not sad. I asked my doctor to try 100mg and she agreed to go for it. Now 2 months later on the 100mg I FEEL GREAT!  No real side effects with the exception of hot flashes and sweats now and then, but nothing too uncomfortable.  I think the difference is higher dosage being more effective in my case is because I am overweight to begin with.  I am down about 12 pounds now and blood pressure is holding steady (132/82) too."
