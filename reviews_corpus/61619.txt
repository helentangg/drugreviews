"I was put on these for depression and anxiety. I didn&#039;t like them, everytime I stood up I felt dizzy. They gave me a terribly dry mouth especially at night. I also found to not have much energy with these and was hard to get out of bed in the morning. I now take sertraline and have noticed a big difference in my mood but I can&#039;t stop yawning."
