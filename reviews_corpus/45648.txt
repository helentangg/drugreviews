"Taking 20mg fluoxetine for 6 weeks, 200mg bupropion 4-5 months.  The 1st week was rough experiencing many side effects.  But I felt more mentally and emotionally balanced within a couple of days, and it has only improved.  I experienced total appetite loss during the first couple weeks and consequently lost 10 pounds, which was a welcome side effect.  I&#039;m not hypersensitive to rejection and criticism, and feel more at ease interacting with others.  The negative thinking is still there, but I can more easily counter those thoughts with rationale &amp; positivity.  I know it&#039;s cliche to say, but I feel like &quot;me&quot; again for the first time in years.  I give it 9/10 because I still get frequent headaches, but the positive far outweighs the negative."
