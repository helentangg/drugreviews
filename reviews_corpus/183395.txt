"I have fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, have had a hip replacement and extensive back surgery for spinal stenosis.  I had pain constantly at times almost to the point I could hardly walk.  After beginning Cymbalta the pain left.  I feel like I did 25 or 30 years ago.  I have had no negative side effects except an occasional mild headache and night sweats some nights.  This medication has been a life-saver, even stopping the nerve pains shooting down my legs.  It&#039;s worth trying it!"
