"My doctor switched me from Cymbalta to Prozac after the Cymbalta didn&#039;t seem to be working for me any longer.  I started out taking 10mg per day, now I am taking 20mg per day.  I had been taking the Prozac at night before going to bed but noticed I was having a lot more trouble getting to sleep.  After reading the dosing information, I realized that I needed to be taking this medication in the morning.  So I will start that in the morning by holding off my dose tonight.  For the time that I&#039;ve been taking this medication, I have not had depressive episodes that I was unable to handle and taking the depression test, it was not as high as it had been in the past.  So for now, I will continue this med but just change to taking it in the morn."
