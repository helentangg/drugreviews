"First of all, I never realized that I had OCD until I told my doctor I couldn&#039;t sleep because I couldn&#039;t control my thoughts. I thought OCD only manifested itself in physical rituals. Paxil has literally saved my life. It broke a 14 year cycle of racing, uncontrollable thoughts/insomnia/anxiety/depression. I have been taking Paxil for 15 years now."
