"So far this medication&#039;s only flaws for me are, weight gain, and lack of ability to stay asleep which was a factor prior but seems to be enhanced. Well my doctor said those symptoms I&#039;m experiencing are those of depression..and upped my dosage to 20mg. It&#039;s only been about a steady two months approx, a little less, and I feel better; I still feel anxiety which I would say comes with my depression but it doesn&#039;t bother me as much to go and be social as before."
