"This med has helped me (male, 50) considerably to deal with depression and panic attacks. I experienced the usual side effects of night sweating and still have some occasional sweaty palms and some yawning. After beginning, my depression initially got worse, but 8 weeks later I feel better-balanced. I switched to taking the med after dinner. I tried 40mg with no additional benefits, only more tired, then back to 20mg. It does take several weeks to reach effectiveness, so be patient if you don&#039;t feel immediate improvement."
