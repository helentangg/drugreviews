"I been taking Prozac for 3 monthes I don&#039;t binge or purge anymore I only throw up when I&#039;m sick . I was thinking about suicide but now I&#039;m 3 month purge free. I&#039;m confident that if I stay on it I can live the rest of my life bulimia free. Bulimia is a ghost of my past now . Peace Michael "
