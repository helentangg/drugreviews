"Just started 5 days ago and piggy-backing with Effexor as I try to wean off of the Effexor.  Noticing the loose bowels.. didn&#039;t occur to me it was from the medicines.  Not a big deal, just annoying.  Feeling dizzy and light-headed but hoping if from the weaning off Effexor.  Just started the 10 mg dose and will start with the 20 mg dose tomorrow.  Effexor made my BP go through the roof after many years of taking it (6 years; BP is 190/140-not good).  Hoping I have the good experience many of you have."
