"kidney started to show reduced ability.  Sweating so profuse during exercise or even vacuuming I have to drink so much water and finally stop too dizzy or tired of sweating.  Sweating got worse coinciding with doubling of dose from 75 to 150.  Subsequently gaining 50lbs. over 4 years of it.  But only recently saw correlation with venaflaxine .  Missing one dose has horrendous reaction of dizziness  and ears and vision effects and headache.    Even taking every day get morning headaches even though I was never one to get headaches before  also it&#039;s help has worn off"
