"I was given this pill for pain relief. It only worked for 3 nights, becuz I would fall asleep as soon as I went to bed. The fourth night the pain in my jaw and ear were back.
I have a dry mouth constantly and am drowsy. I had a back tooth filled, becuz I had a cavity. It hurt last night a little  but my jaw and ear was worse. I told dentist to pull it, but he thought he could save it and just fill it. Wrong. Now I have to call him back and get off this pill. I am sure it is my tooth."
