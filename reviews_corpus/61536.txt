"Have been on citalopram for around 3 weeks for severe GAD. Physical symptoms of stress have lessened immensely, (all following symptoms were before citalopram- left shoulder no longer hurts, ribs and sternum no longer ache, no jaw ache, nausea and loose stools have lessened, heart rate is gradually stabilising, not as aggressive, don&#039;t feel like I&#039;m having a heart attack, palpitations lessened, able to sleep) 
I do feel calmer, I&#039;m on 10mg daily, and will be slowly upping to 20mg. I still have no appetite ( have lost 3 st since July through anxiety) and I feel slightly nauseous every now and again. I&#039;m struggling with dizziness.
I&#039;ve not really had any side effects on this, other than occasional waves of nausea in the beginning. Keep at it!"
