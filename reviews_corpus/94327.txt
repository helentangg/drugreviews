"I have been on every antidepressant under the sun. I kind of started to lose really all hope in everything. SSRI or SNRI&#039;s had really negative side effects (mostly sexual) or some would give me &quot;brain zaps&quot; or other issues. Wellbutrin didn&#039;t really do much for me but force up my dosage of Klonopin I had to take. All around I would say this one is the best one I have tried so far. I have a very noticeable decrease in Anxiety. I have only been on it for a month, the depression is better but still there and I have random episodes of crying which I never had before(embarrassing as a 26 year old man). No sexual side effects, no known side effects so far minus the crying randomly. Will update later."
