"This medication has greatly improved my quality of life! I have chronic tension headaches, everyday and all day, unless I take 25 mg of my Pamelar. I take it every night (because it does make me sleepy) and If I forget my headaches start right back up around 3pm the next day. One downfall is that I seem to craves snacks much more since I&#039;ve been on this drug. I&#039;ll take that side-effect over chronic headache."
