"I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) since 1995. I had been on Paxil and Prozac in the earlier years, but stopped taking medication in 2000.  As years went on and as I got older (now 40) the GAD had gotten worse.  I was feeling more sad, crying spells, anxious, nervous, angry and an overall sense of unhappiness.  I started Lexapro 2 weeks ago after consulting with my doctor.  I started out on 5mg for 6 days and now up to 10mg.  I feel human again, however I do have trouble sleeping at night and I overall feel &quot;numb.&quot;  I&#039;m not yet sure if I like the fact I have no feelings of complete joy or love, but I do know I can express myself better of what is on my mind.  It has helped me significantly!"
