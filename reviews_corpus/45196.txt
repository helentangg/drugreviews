"I took Prozac for about a year.  My husband said I seemed less depressed so I continued taking it, but in most ways I seemed worse.  I felt like  a zombie.  I lost interest in sex.  I just sat around all day doing nothing.  I am 65 now and I have had depression since I was about 10.  I find that meditation, exercise, and careful eating have helped me way more than prozac.  The only time I get depressed now is if I eat junk food.  I eat only organic foods.  I quit eating all grains (pasta, rice, cereal, bread, crackers, cookies, cake, etc.).  I never use sugar.  If I need a little sweetener I use stevia (no artificial sweeteners).  I eat a lot of veggies.  I eat only a small amount of fruit (sugar) especially berries.  Healthy/Happy."
