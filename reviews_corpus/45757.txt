"Only been on 10mg for a week now but already feeling the benefits and about to begin 20mg. The only downside is that it did give me anxiety on one particular day that I was extremely stressed out and depressed and I felt somewhat on edge, hostile, aggressive, anxious. But now I feel totally euphoric and my social anxiety has decreased significantly and I expect it to continue to get even better. I also have post traumatic stress disorder from a car accident. I have noticed a small amount of improvement so far but not much. Will comment again perhaps in 1 month to let you all know how its going."
