"I&#039;ve been on Sertraline since my teen years and although it was hard for the first few months, the pros definitely outweigh the cons. My OCD affects my life profoundly and used to be so bad that I couldn&#039;t even sleep at night, but Setraline helped ease my symptoms to the point I was better able to help myself. I still suffer, but the combination of Sertraline and CBT has given my life some much needed stability."
