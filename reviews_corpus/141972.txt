"I&#039;ve been on 10mg of Lexapro daily since mid 2007 for major recurrent depression.  It&#039;s worked for me so far.  The side effects are not something I like, but when I speak with my doctors (military doctors) all they&#039;ve told me is &quot;It&#039;s your choice, you can be fat and happy or skinny and depressed.  Which one do you want?&quot;  Since being on it I&#039;ve gained 50lbs that I can&#039;t shed that slowly creeps up over time.  My sex drive is non-existent, difficult to climax or it&#039;s unsatisfying.  If I forget to take my medicines for a few days my mood swings to grouchy, snappy, and short tempered.  On a bonus note, my doctors kept me on Lexapro during pregnancy/breastfeeding and my baby had NO issues, perfectly healthy."
