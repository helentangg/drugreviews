"MIGRAINE SUFFERERS BEWARE: this medication took my migraine condition to another level of pain and frequency. The worst part is that my doctor did not share with me that Zoloft can make migraines worse before I started the medication. I had at least 2-3 days every week that not only was I completely incapacitated by the pain of them (something typical with migraines) to the point that I could not go to class, but the vomiting and nausea was relentless. I lost 15 pounds on this medication after taking it for just 6 weeks because of the vomiting from migraines. I went to the hospital toward the end of trying Zoloft because of dehydration and the worst pain I&#039;ve felt in my life from the migraines this caused. be careful if you have migraines"
