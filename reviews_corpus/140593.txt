"I was suffering some weird feeling last month. Had 2 panic attacks and I think it came from too much stress and thinking about my health. Scheduled a check-up with a Psychiatrist and he prescribed me Morcet (Escitalopram) &amp; Rivotril (Clonazepam). First few days, I felt the some minor side effects (yawning, anxiousness etc). After a week, I felt better. A little anxious sometimes, but more controlled. I only take 10 mg a day (after breakfast) and 500 mcg of Clonazepam before bedtime.

Will be back to my Psychiatrist after a month to discuss and taper my medication since I think I can manage now my anxiety/panic attacks without medication. Miracle drugs!!!"
