"I started viibryd just yesterday on a starter pack from my doctor that I requested. I&#039;ve tried SEVERAL different antidepressants since I was a teenager: Paxil, Zoloft, cymbalta, celexa, lexapro, and the list goes on. So this brings me to viibryd. I would strongly advise you be very careful with this one. It has strongly resembled an amphetamine for me. I&#039;m on a 10 mg dose and already I woke up an hour and 15 min earlier this morning(1 day) I felt very alert throughout the entire day at work, and even still feel so wired I can&#039;t imagine going to sleep for several more hours(it&#039;s 10:30 pm). I&#039;m not sure about titrating to 20mg with this current  effect. I&#039;ll see how it goes and keep you all updated! Any reaction from others would be helpful!"
