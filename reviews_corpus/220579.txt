"I have been sick for over 4 years now and been on this for the past 2 weeks and its been a miracle. I haven&#039;t been sick or in pain once. I don&#039;t mean I just vomit, I start and I can&#039;t stop for 19 of 30 days. So far the minute I took one, that night I have been more relaxed and less sick have been able to cut down my oxycodone and Zofran so I am thankful. I will let you know how it continues to go but so far its my miracle."
