"Cymbalta 60mg for approximately 6 months, I am now taking 30mg. At first I was afraid to take it, but a few days into it and I was dancing at my first doctor&#039;s office. Works well but does not take away the burning inside my muscles. Maybe I&#039;ll need to return to 60mg. Do not take with opioids they just don&#039;t mix well, I had no pain but my mood was somewhat strange."
