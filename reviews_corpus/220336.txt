"Started using for Fibromyalgia first.  When diagnosed with Interstitial Cystitis my doctor upped my dosage to 50mg each night.  Not really sure which Interstitial Cystitis or medication for other conditions are helping or hurting.  I haven&#039;t found the magic pill that really helps with any of my conditions as I&#039;m in a constant flare with several at a time on a daily basis.  This does help you sleep.  I&#039;ve been on it for yrs and haven&#039;t gained any weight (probably due to other medicines that take away my appetite).  All in all, if you have never tried this for Interstitial Cystitis pain; try it.  Everybody is different &amp; this medicine just might be the right one for you."
