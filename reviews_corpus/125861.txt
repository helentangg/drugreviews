"I have been on 10mg of viibryd for about a month.  I have a low drug tolerance and I couldn&#039;t get past the side effects of the other drugs I&#039;ve tried.  Viibryd had very minimal side effects that are now gone (vivid dreams and brain zaps). My anxiety has significantly lessened and I&#039;m out of that depression fog. What a relief to be out of that negative state and constant worry! It just goes to show that differnt drugs work differently for everyone. Viibryd isn&#039;t well reviewed, but the ones that are highly scored didn&#039;t work for me at all. Don&#039;t give up or be afraid to find your perfect fit."
