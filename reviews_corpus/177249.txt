"Been taking generic cymbalta for about 2 months for depression, anxiety, and OCD. When I first started I fluctuated between super tired and super hyper, that lasted for a few weeks. I also got dizzy a lot. After about 4 weeks all the side effects went away and now it&#039;s helping a lot with depression and helps a bit with anxiety and OCD. Your mileage may vary but for me this medication has been a godsend."
