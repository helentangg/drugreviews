"I was very very bad at one point with my anxieyy and depression and the OCD, they were all working together against me, the horrible disgusting thoughts from the OCD was driving me into constant panic attacks and anxiety through the roof! Which drove me to stay in doors and avoid triggers which then pushed me into a deep deep depression, I&#039;ve been on zoloft now for about 6 months on a low dose of of 50mg, and I feel much better! I was able to go out and get a job which I am excelling at and got three raises in 4 months! I have felt a bit of the anxiety and ocd poking out once in a while but I may need to raise the dose but over all this med had changed my life so far, if you are in a rut and are down don&#039;t give up you can regain your life back!"
