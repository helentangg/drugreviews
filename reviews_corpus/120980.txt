"I started this medication 2 weeks ago to help with anxiety, cognitive issues, and hypochondria. I&#039;m currently on 75 mg. The first day I began to feel calmer but within the next few days more anxiety symptoms switch to depression. I went from having OCD thoughts and medical worries to wanting to sleep any chance I can get. There&#039;s also a complete loss of libido. I&#039;ve also started having constipation problems."
