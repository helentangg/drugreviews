"I have been on lexapro and abilify for several years. The combination of the both were not helping. When I started taking viibryd I had your typical side effects but they went away and I have been on it three months and have felt better then ever. The only problem I have had is nightmares when I accidentally miss a dose ..anybody else have that?"
