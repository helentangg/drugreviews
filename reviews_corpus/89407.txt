"I am 28 year old female. I was prescribed 10 mg.  I read a lot of reviews on Celexa where people said they felt a difference the first week and was starting to get really disappointed when I felt no different in that time frame.  I have been on it for exactly 7 weeks now and am just now starting to notice a difference. My interests have returned, I have more energy, and I am able to focus.  Overall I am definitely happier and don&#039;t feel down in the dumps anymore.  The only side effect I had was it made me very tired in the beginning but that has gone away completely.  For me, Celexa is working!"
