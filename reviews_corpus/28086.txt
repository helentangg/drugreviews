"I started taking Lexapro nearly two years ago after struggling with generalised and social anxiety for years. I have been taking 5mg consistently. Side effects were noticeable for the first week or so but now I get none at all. No sexual side effects whatsoever. In the time I&#039;ve been taking it I&#039;ve relocated to a new job and had a promotion, motivation through the roof. The negative thought patterns have disappeared."
