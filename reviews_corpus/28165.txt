"I have suffered from mild depression/moderate to severe anxiety for several years now. I married for the second time January 2014 (blended family) which started to exacerbate all my issues!  Runaway thoughts of scenarios that &quot;might&quot; happen and how I would react.  Very emotionally unstable.  Tendency to over-react immediately to minor situations (plus the run away thoughts start....) and would physically have to calm myself down.  Easily irritated.
Finally went to my Dr. and she put me on 10 mg Lexapro last week.
The effects were evident withing 24 hours.  No immediate over reaction, run away negative thoughts almost completely gone....wow.  How could a little pill make such a huge difference?!?"
