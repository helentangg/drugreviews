Dec,2016 I became sick, overloaded, crying constantly &amp; fearful. Dr. gave me Zoloft &amp; Xanax, was terrified to take either, but started xanax once a day at .12mg and it eased anxiety soon went to .25 2x a day. Finally took Zoloft 25mg. Side effects were horrible! Upped to 37.5 after 2 months,2 months later 50.Wish I had listened and taken 50 mg First. My family forced me to stick with it, tho side effects were unbearable.Then One day ,4 weeks into the 50mg dose I felt like my old self. I was excited about life! Happy again. After a week I quit Xanax. I&#039;m Working again &amp;l oving life! Seek therapy! You can do it!"
