"I have started taking Lovan. It has changed my life. I cannot believe it.  I wish I had gone on this medication years ago. I have had severe impairing depression my whole life from the earliest age. I cannot believe the difference. I am myself but I am positive, I no longer wake up in the night worrying, I don&#039;t have that constant sadness that I could never shake. I feel happy. I feel sane. I actually feel energized sometimes to exercise but I had to take it at night not morning or I was too tired in the day. I switched to night and my life has turned around. 
The first month was hard with side effects but then taking it at night has changed my life.  I absolutely love this medicine and I was a natural medicine freak. Why oh why."
