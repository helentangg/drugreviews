"I have chronic migraines. I was prescribed this as a preventive. One of my migraine triggers is sleep. I cannot take naps in the day time nor oversleep in the morning or else I will get a migraine. This drug makes me drowsy as all hell, such that it actually causes MORE migraines. In addition to constantly being sleepy, I of course have little energy for exercise and lost productivity at work, and in the end I still end up needing a prescription strength painkiller to deal with the migraines. Useless drug."
