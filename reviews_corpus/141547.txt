"I have no depression only anxiety disorder and panic attacks. On Lexapro 10 mg for almost two weeks. Anxiety definitely has decreased already. I actually think I was in a better mood off the Lexapro, because I didn&#039;t suffer from depression in the first place. It has a desensitizing effect in the sense that I know there are things still present that would normally make me go into a panic or severely anxious, however, I almost don&#039;t care. I know it&#039;s there, but emotionally I am not affected. I have had side effects such as sweaty palms and feet, jitters, spacey at times, hard to get out what I want to say when it pertains to something that may be a stressor. Horrible yawning, fatigue and sleepiness. A slight bit of dry mouth and trouble focusing."
