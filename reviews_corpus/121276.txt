"I&#039;ve been on antidepressants for 16 years. From Celexa, to Prozac, to Paxil with none ever truly taking away my depression and anxiety. I suffer from major depressive disorder, ptsd, anxiety and I&#039;m bipolar as well. Since starting Effexor, my life has dramatically changed for the better. I&#039;m honestly the happiest and calmest I&#039;ve been since the age of 15. I started with 37.5mg 2x daily and I&#039;m now up to max dosage. I&#039;ve zero side effects and can function fully without benzodiazepines for my anxiety thanks to this medication. I HIGHLY recommend giving it a try, especially if no other antidepressants have truly made you feel 100%. It&#039;s possible to beat depression with the right medication, just keep on trying and hang in there!"
