"I started taking this medicine about 4 months ago when I was dealing with a very hard breakup and suffering from panic attacks. My resistance to stress was at rock bottom when I started taking Lexapro and it stopped my panic attacks immediately. I realized I&#039;d been dealing with anxiety my whole life and had just thought it was normal and a part of my basic personality. The side effects at first were difficulty sleeping and a lack of appetite.  The longer I&#039;ve been on this medication the more &quot;even&quot; I have felt...able to handle stress but still be myself.  I&#039;m so much more comfortable in social situations and all of my obsessive worrying is gone. Sleep and appetite are normal now. Still feel emotions but don&#039;t lose control."
