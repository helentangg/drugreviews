"I started on citalopram 3 days ago. Day 1 was the worst! 3 hours after taking the pill I was sick a few times and felt dizzy and tired. I went to work that night feeling drained and every time I blinked I thought I was going to fall asleep! Day 2 I was skeptical at whether I wanted to take it again.  But I did .. I was absolutely fine just felt a little tired and nauseous. Day 3 started grinding my teeth hard without realising and my heart beat kept going fast  but it was okay because my mind was blank. I didn&#039;t feel anything .. I wasn&#039;t hurting I wasn&#039;t sad I wasn&#039;t angry and things that&#039;s normally anger me just didn&#039;t bother me. I could go out into the world with the humans and didn&#039;t feel paranoid or embarrassed."
