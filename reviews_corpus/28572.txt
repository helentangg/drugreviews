"I started taking lexapro for anxiety associated with over analyzing everything.. parents separating.. and getting engaged. The side effects the first couple of weeks included nausea, dizziness, headaches and wide awake feeling at night. The pros: took away the thoughts running through my mind.. blushing.. helped even out all of my emotions.  The CONS: I stopped lexapro in December  before I wanted to get pregnant and 1 week later I had a massive migraine (never had one) and lost my ability to speak.. see.. it was awful.. rushed to the ER thinking I had a stroke.. everything came back fine. Just remember if you plan on getting off before pregnancy.. give yourself a good few mths. The withdrawls are a NIGHTMARE!!! Dizziness, nausea.,headaches"
