"My experience with taking fluoxetine 40 mg has been great! My doctors tried several antidepressants. I  must say I feel like a new person being on Fluoxetine  I was so stressed out from working in a hostile environment and going through a menopause all at the same time.  The problems became so intense my doctor literally had to take me off my job.  I was having severe depression, anxiety, and panic attacks that was out of control.  I was put me on the medication in January 2015.  I have lost 29 lbs of stress weight that I had been carrying for quite sometime.  I truly thank God for having a great set of doctors.

Best."
