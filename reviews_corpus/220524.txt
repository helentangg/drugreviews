"My 10 rating is for the medicine&#039;s effectiveness for insomnia, not pain.

I used to take lots of medications, including amitriptyline. I gained 20 pounds. To lose weight, I started adhering to a plant-based diet and exercising. After 4 months of diet and exercise, my pain was almost gone, so I dropped all of my medications. After that, I lost 15 pounds.

A few months later, my insomnia came back. Because I wasn&#039;t sleeping, my pain increased again. So, I started back on amitriptyline. I take 30mg 4-5hrs before bed.

It takes a few weeks to kick-in as a sleep aid and it might cause night-sweats for about a month. After a month, I started sleeping like a rock and I have no side-effects or weight gain. My previous weight-gain was due to Gabapentin."
