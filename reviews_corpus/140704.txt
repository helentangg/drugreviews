"I have more of a questions.  i had been on lexapro 20 for 15 years. I had one anxiety attack that lasted a week before I felt better.  I am now on Viibryd the first couple of weeks were great but now I&#039;m so depressed and having anxiety.  Can I just go back to lexapro? Its the weekend and I don&#039;t think I can wait until Monday to see my dr."
