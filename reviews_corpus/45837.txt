"I just started using Prozac a couple of weeks ago and it has been life changing. I am a combat veteran who suffers from severe anxiety and sleeping problems and this drug has completely abated those symptoms. My mood is much better, I can concentrate for longer periods of time and I don&#039;t have the social anxiety that was plaguing me since I left the Marine Corps.

All in all, this is a great drug that has helped me move on from my anxiety. I take 20mg per day (minimum dose) and that is working fine."
