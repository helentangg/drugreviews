Viibryd at 10 mg first week helped, increased to 20mg as instructed. Have weakness overall, heart palpitations, dilated pupils, annoyed easily , unable to achieve the big O, gut feels awful and bloated, Cervical Dystonia is aggravated. I have not had diarrhea but cramping. Jittery feeling , thoughts of being better off dead for a few days now. Have only been on this med for 3 weeks... not sure what to do..."
