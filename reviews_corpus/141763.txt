"I have always tended to dwell on things and make things more than they are for as long as I can remember. I am a 28 years old, young-professional who was laid off 4 months ago. Despite not being too distraught about being laid-off &quot;I thought&quot;, I began having panic episodes about 3-4 month where symptoms resembled a heart attack. After an ER and 2 Doctors visits, I was prescribed Lexapro. I started the treatment Monday night, and no lie was &quot;on cloud 9&quot; Tuesday morning all day and into Wednesday (today). I take 10mg once every other day! I have just taken my second dose and I am so much more at ease and this medicine is great for those with depressive and anxiety symptoms. Definite improvement in quality of life."
