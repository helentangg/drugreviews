"I would have rated Cymbalta a 10 if not for lowered libido &amp; difficulty going off of it (not uncommon for most all AD&#039;s). 

I took for 6 years after an episode of anxiety &amp; depression. I would still be taking it but it effect was dropping off after about 6 years so I switched meds (wish I hadn&#039;t have messed with switching but that&#039;s another story). 

The only side effect I noticed consistently over 6 years was decreased libido. I&#039;m sure there were initial start up effects but I was such a nervous wreck that I either didn&#039;t notice or don&#039;t remember. 

It was a great med for me &amp; I wish it still worked."
