"I have been on this medicine for 8 days now and have constant, severe nausea.  This is the second night in a row that I have thrown-up. My sex drive is back which is why I switched from Lexapro 10 mg.  I am hoping the nausea will go away.  I have also gained 3 lbs in these 8 days!  Tomorrow I am going to keep a food diary and when I take my medicine to see if I can make any changes.  The swelling in my stomach has not gotten better and has been there for 2 days now."
