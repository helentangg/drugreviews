"If my comment helps anyone not to take this drug Effexor then I will have helped many people. I have been on and off Effexor for 10 years I&#039;m currently off Effexor I weaned myself over 6 months. I have not read any where and I have done a lot of research that anyone has written if they have successfully stayed of this drug for more than 12 months. So hear I am to tell you it&#039;s been 9 months and once the side effect of the brain buzzes nauseous aching bones itchiness have gone away
Life does begin to feel better I caught myself laughing and not feeling it was fake and crying at Tv shows Effexor gives you a fake feeling of happiness/sadness but after being on it for to long you just feel numb I believe this is why people end up wanting to come off it cause you have no emotion that and the amount of weight you will gain. 9 months and I&#039;m probably back to where I began in needing this medication but I am trying everything I possibly can to stay of it 
This includes:
Free hypnosis apps 
Free mediation apps
Self help quotes
Vitamin b12
Iron tablets 
The biggest one is when I mentally feel myself thinking negative I tell myself to stop and think of my daughters smiling face 
I&#039;m not cured I&#039;m far from it but I will never take this drug again I was worse with it than without it 
If I help one person not to take this drug the I will be a better person good luck"
