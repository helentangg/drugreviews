"I have suffered depression since the age of 14, and it was never treated. Last year, at age 20, I reached a new extreme. I was volatile, angry, irritated and I withdrew completely from life. It physically hurt me to be around the people I loved. I hated myself, and constantly felt disconnected from the life I was meant to be living. The week my psychologist prescribed me Prisitiq, I had a breakdown at Uni. I went home, sat on the front step and cried silently for hours. The next day, I started Pristiq. I have never felt better. I have bad days, as we all do; however, Pristiq and I are good buddies now, and she never makes me feel sick."
