"20 year old college student. I&#039;ve had OCD since I was a kid (depression since junior year of high school) but only within the last year did I make the choice to take an SSRI. There&#039;s a lot of ambiguity surrounding antidepressants, and you can&#039;t really extract much from reviews without feeling reluctant. Yes, there are side effects that appear within the early stages. It is scary to ingest a drug you know little about. However, I can feel happy again, which I thought I had lost the ability to do. I don&#039;t believe everything is hopeless, which I, truthfully, thought I&#039;d feel the rest of my life. It&#039;s been a lifesaver, and at 100mg, nothing feels inherently different about myself. It&#039;s just a tablet. Don&#039;t let it be more than it ought to be."
