"Since I was in 10th grade, I&#039;ve had anxiety and depression. I was placed on Lexapro 10mg, but still had some social anxiety and anxiety about other things. I didn&#039;t have as much as before so the doctor increased it to 20mg. I&#039;ve never felt better. Like others have said, I almost forget I have anxiety. I feel fine everyday and it&#039;s the greatest feeling in the world. If anyone is reading this post and is unsure about asking the doctor about help with anxiety, social anxiety, depression, etc, please don&#039;t wait. This drug truly saved my life."
