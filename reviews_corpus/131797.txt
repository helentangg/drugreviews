"Effexor works reasonably well for me. I&#039;m on 150mg and for the most part it controls my depression. I do find it better to take this med in the morning. Firstly because I think it lessens the depression for me when I take it at that time. Also it stops the side effect of dizziness for me. If I miss the meds I know about it. As the dizziness does not go away otherwise. That&#039;s really the only side effect that I find that&#039;s negative about this med."
