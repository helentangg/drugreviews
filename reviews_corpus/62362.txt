"As a police officer, I suffer from high amounts of stress.  Over the years it gave me anxiety.  Started with Lexapro, but it made me a zombie.  Cymbalta gave me suicidal thoughts.  Celexa worked great for 4 years.  It leveled me out and I became a much better father, husband and police officer.  After 4 years, it stopped working very quickly.  I have switched to Wellbutrin and hope it works as well as Celexa did."
