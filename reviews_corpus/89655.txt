"Since I was 14 I have battled with severe depression. I never believed that I actually was depressed until one point I felt driven to the edge of taking my life. I decided that this was the only option I had not tried. After only a week I began to respond with the only side effect being an awful headache following the first dose. I have my life back again and man does it feel good."
