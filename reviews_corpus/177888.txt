"Took 30 mg/day for 2 months and no noticeable reduction of pain. Increased to 60 mg/day for 2 more months and still no relief of fibromyalgia at all. Killed my libido entirely and had difficulty sleeping regardless of taking it morning or night. Luckily no side effects weaning off (half dose for 2 weeks, then every other day for 2 more weeks)."
