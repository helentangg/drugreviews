"The first 3 months on Viibryd was great, was on 20 mg. Had a lot of energy and felt like my old self again, then I took a turn downward. So they up the medicine to 40 mg and I had the worst side effects possible. Heart pounding and palpitations, panic attacks, bad diarrhea, sleep deprived, crying, shaking, loss of appetite, bad nightmares, so they took me down to 20mg but added Buspar. I have been on other antidepressants and never ever had such bad side effects... I still have diarrhea and nervousness. "
