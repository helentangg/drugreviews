"I&#039;m a 50 year old male diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder at age 25. Went through years of therapy and thought I&#039;d pretty much learned how to manage/mitigate anxiety. I recently came upon a scene where I rendered first-aid to a gunshot victim. Almost immediately afterward I felt &#039;hollow&#039; and began ruminating about death.

That event acted like a pebble rolling down a mountain and by last week I was experiencing a variety of physical symptoms on top of being angry and withdrawn. My Internal Medicine doctor suggested I go on Zoloft. Within an hour of taking the first 25mg tab I felt a gigantic sense of relief. Five days later I%u2019m still experiencing some minor  jitters and cotton mouth and my  mind races a bit. But the immense sense of relief is still with me."
