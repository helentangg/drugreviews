"I had very bad anxiety and was prescribed Prozac. I found the initial side effects very difficult and didn&#039;t feel quite right for some time and was constantly doubting the medicine. However, after eight weeks of taking it, the side effects have subsided and I feel back to my usual self. What a relief. If you are finding it tough, hang on in there, I&#039;m sure you will get there."
