"I took Zoloft for 1 year, the first antidepressant I ever was prescribed. I began with 50mg daily and within 3 days I felt like a new person. The only major side effect was sexual, to the point that my doctor has now switched me to Effexor XR in the hopes that it will be better. But I can highly recommend the Zoloft anyway. Every person is different and sometimes you and your doctor have to experiment to find the one that&#039;s right for you, but there is something out there for everyone."
