"I have been taking this medication for 2 months, the first month I suffered almost all of the side effects from loss of appetite, headaches, dizziness, loss of concentration, loss of sex drive and not sleeping.
2 month in and I find myself having episodes of feeling really angry and crying for no reason and to the point of not eating and just sleeping.
I am seeing a psychologist and am yet to discuss with them why I am still feeling depressed and now angry with or at myself."
