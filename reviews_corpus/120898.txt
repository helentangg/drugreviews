"I have tried quite a few antidepressants (fluoxetine, citalopram, trazadone, quetiapine amatryptaline,) but they all seemed to have side affects that I couldn&#039;t handle. I was prescribed venlafaxine XL 75mg twice a day. The start was pretty intense I suffered clenched jaw, constant yawning and excessive sweating however I kept taking them for a month and the side affects slowed right down. I think the worse side affect long term is insomnia, forget having a cat nap in the afternoon because you&#039;ll pay the price at night. The good points are that my life is actually feeling normal. My anxiety has gotten fewer and fewer to not having any. I can face the world and I can smile again. This drug has probably saved my life. I&#039;m me again ☺️"
