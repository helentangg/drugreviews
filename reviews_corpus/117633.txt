"This medication has been a life saver.  I am a 23 year old female and was diagnosed with Irritable Bowel Syndrome 10 years ago.  It wasn&#039;t until 2 years ago that my primary care doctor suggested this medication after finding success with another patient.  Only 10 mg a day at bedtime and I am IBS symptom free. I used to have 5  bowel motions a day and now I am very regular.  My life is so different now that I am on this medication.  When I started the medication I had extreme dry mouth that went away after a couple of months and now I sometimes become constipated (which is something I&#039;ve never had in my life)."
