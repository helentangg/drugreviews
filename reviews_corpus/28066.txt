"I have been on a few other anti-anxiety meds over the past decade.  The last one I was on was an absolute nightmare, so I vowed to NEVER take meds again.  Since then, I tried natural remedies, exercise etc. to combat this constant agitation and anxiety I have been feeling.  I couldn&#039;t really be in the moment and enjoy.  I&#039;ve been on 10 mg. of Lexapro for over 2 months now and haven&#039;t felt this good in a forever (it seems).  I feel normal again and I actually want to get out and do things.  I see now how severely depressed/anxious I have been for so long.  This medication has given me my life back.  I have not gained any weight, thus far and have stayed the same.  Everyone is different, so I feel very lucky that this is working for me."
