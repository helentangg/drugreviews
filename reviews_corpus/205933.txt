"I started taking Pristiq yesterday. Immediate nausea and tired, been up since 1am. Hope this medicine works because everything and everyone has been getting on my nerves. Even my grand kids which is not normal for me because they are my life. Do not take anything else with Pristiq. Maybe I can give a higher rating in a couple of weeks."
