"I&#039;m at 5 months and I&#039;m finally feeling better. The first 2 weeks were TERRIBLE (nausea, insomnia, increased anxiety). The first 2 months were bad but bearable, wouldn&#039;t have made it through without the emergency ativan my doctor prescribed me. Finally started to feel better around 3 months. Started at 25mg and slowly moved up in 12.5mg increments to 75mg. Also went to therapy, practiced mediation, and exercised to help recovery."
