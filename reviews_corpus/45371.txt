"Today is my 7th day on generic fluoxetine for Major Depressive Disorder (of the apathetic type) most likely due to high stress. Last night I had odd thoughts. I couldn&#039;t finish a sentence in my head. I would consider it flight of ideas. Then I wake up this morning feeling refreshed even though I&#039;m still not sleeping well. I got right to doing stuff. I can&#039;t stop doing stuff. I&#039;m a bit shaky, but I thinks that&#039;s because I&#039;m not eating much today. I don&#039;t have much of an appetite. Normally at this time I&#039;d feel starving if I hadn&#039;t eaten since breakfast. The only unfortunate thing is although I&#039;m getting stuff done, I can&#039;t focus on one thing for a long period. I&#039;m trying to read but I read a couple paragraphs and then rearrange the fridge."
