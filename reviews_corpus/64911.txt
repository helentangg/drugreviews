"I&#039;ve taken Zoloft off and on within the last 3 years. I do much better with it. I went from being so low that I couldn&#039;t take care of myself because of anxiety and depression. With Zoloft and better life circumstances I am doing much better. I&#039;m actually happy! Right now I&#039;m on 25 milligrams. Sometimes I&#039;m on 50. When I had postpartum blues, 100 milligrams was necessary to feel positive."
