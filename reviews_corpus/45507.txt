"I have been in this medicine for 7 months, first started on 20mg, now increasing to 40mg. I am taking it for  depression and anxiety. It takes about a month before I see some effects. Mood was lifted and feel calmer but can&#039;t  stop yawning. In the beginning, I did felt increased anxiety before this subsides...I will continue to take this medicine and hope to get better."
