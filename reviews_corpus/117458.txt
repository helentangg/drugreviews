"I am 56 years old who with severe chronic nerve pain in my neck from herniation at C6-C7 and C4-C5. I opted no surgery and I have had zero quality of life and on bed rest for 4 years.  Started PT with pain meds neurotin 600mg and I was slowly able to function in a brain fog but free from strong narcotics. Went to amitriptyline 40mg at night slept great but next day brain fog with memory lapses and always tired. Now on 10mg nortriptyline I take in the morning Because it affects me like a stimulate and hard to sleep at night but been on for a week. I have constipation but I take fiber in water helps. I love been alert with a clear head! So far no pain on 10mg so I won&#039;t increase unless I have pain.  A very livable dose."
