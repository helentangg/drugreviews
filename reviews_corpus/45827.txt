"I started taking 20mg daily after losing my job, moving to a new house and town and my Mom was diagnosed with cancer.  It has been about 20 days and I am feeling better already.  Placebo effect or not I am handling the stresses of life much better.   I mainly chose to seek help because I was wrecking my relationship with my true love.  I lost my appetite for the first 2 weeks but it is coming back slowly. I have not experienced any side effects.  I recommend this medicine and I have never taken a prescription medicine for stress/anxiety or depression before. For those of you looking for some relief and calm- I say Do It.  It is definitely worth trying."
