"Started taking Effexor in October and it&#039;s completely changed my life. I no longer have unusual anxiety and haven&#039;t had a single panic attack (despite being exposed to many triggers). I can&#039;t believe what a huge difference it&#039;s made. I feel like I have my life back again. I was previously on Lexapro, which I found didn&#039;t really alleviate my systems to the same degree, and caused me to be tired all the time. The only side effect I&#039;ve had with Effexor has been weight loss."
