"Unfortunately my insurance only covers $60. The up side is I barely had any nausea or diarrhea and then only for a few days when I started the 40mg dose. Viibryd seems to be working great for me. I have had more intense dreams and a few nightmares. Nothing overly bothersome. While on Paxil, I had horrible cravings for sweets. I was at one point eating 1/2 cup of peanut butter with 1/2 cup sugar mixed in. The cravings were compulsive and I gained 15lbs in 6 weeks. So far the cravings are almost completely gone and I have maintained the weight I am for 2 weeks. I&#039;m hoping I will be able to lose the initial 15lb gain. So far no sexual side effects. My anxiety is under control too."
