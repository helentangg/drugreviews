"I have been taking 10 mgs. Lexapro now for two months for depression and anxiety. I hope I never have to stop.  I started feeling better the first day and it hasn&#039;t let up. This has made me feel as good as I did 15 years ago. (Previously it was a slow, steady decline). There are definitely side effects: for me there have been pretty serious fatigue and near-total loss of appetite. I will use weight gain supplements to stop the weight loss if I have to (I already weigh 107 lbs., down from 115lbs), but I&#039;m not sure what to do about the fatigue other than drink more coffee. (I should also note that this medicine completely solved my sleeping problem, literally the first night. I used to never sleep; now I sleep 7 hours. A miracle for me!)."
