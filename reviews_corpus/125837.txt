"I have taken 20 mg of Viibryd for 4 years and it has been the single best antidepressant I have ever taken.  I have taken Zoloft, Prozac, Lexapro, Cymbalta, Wellbutrin and Effexor.  All of them caused major weight gain (especially Zoloft) &amp; none of them continued to work after about 12-18 months.  Viibryd saved my marriage; I am able to easily achieve orgasm.  While the other medicines made me numb and interfered with my sleep, Viibryd has allowed me to feel, but also to cope.
I am only writing this today because I may need to finally go up to 40 mg.  But it worked like a charm for 4 years, even through incredibly intense, life changing stressful events.  This drug has been a life saver for me."
