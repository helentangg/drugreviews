"I&#039;ve only been on celexa for a month, I am 5&#039;5&quot; and I was 112lbs and they put me on 10mg, but it didn&#039;t help at all, it made me start having panic attacks and anxiety attacks again I&#039;m also on klonopin ((1mg twice a day)) for panic disorder and adderall ((20mg XR in the morning and 10mg IR at lunch time)) for inattentive adhd), I haven&#039;t been any less depressed, and I&#039;m 99lbs now and they just doubled my dose to see if that will work. I really hope it does, because right now I absolutely hate it. I&#039;ve been eating more than I normally do but losing weight rapidly, and I&#039;m already underweight. Celexa so far makes me feel like I&#039;m on the verge of falling asleep almost 24/7; the rest of the time is when I&#039;m having anxiety and panic attacks."
