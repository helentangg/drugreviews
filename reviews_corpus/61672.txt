"I have been taking citalopram HBR 10 mg for about a year. I have had more restfull nights than I have had in many years. Hot flashes have been reduced by 90 percent, none at night!! My anxiety is gone most of the time. So far so good. I don&#039;t know what long term use will do to my organs. I haven&#039;t found a lot of information on long term use.  Over all very happy with this medication!!"
