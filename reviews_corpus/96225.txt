"I was just prescribed this medication for GAD and Moderate Depression. My Doctor suggested 25mg once a night. I accidentally took 50mg the very first dose but I feel fine. It took me a little while to fall asleep last night and I feel a bit drowsy but I am writing this from work so obviously I&#039;m still functioning normally. I realize that Zoloft will affect everyone differently and I am very nervous/excited about its potential to help me. I&#039;m hoping that in time I will feel less tired. I take Vitamin B 12 shots every few weeks so that should help too. I&#039;ve never taken any prescriptions before now so I was very nervous about this whole thing. The reviews have been helpful though, I wish you all the very best of luck with your treatments."
