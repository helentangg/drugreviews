"I was on Celexa 20mg for a full year due to anxiety and panic attacks. The medicine was working great. I had to switch doctors and my new one suggested to a try Lexapro. She said its a cleaner and better medicine then Celexa. I said ok I&#039;ll try it. It&#039;s been two week and no side effects at all. It&#039;s been great. I&#039;m glad I switched. I&#039;m taking 10mg of Lexapro now which is the same as 20mg Celexa."
