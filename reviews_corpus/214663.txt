"Started at 17 for MDD &amp; GAD, I&#039;m almost 20 and recently dx&#039;d w BPD now (comorbid w the above). 
5mg first week, 10mg 2 years, 20mg 5 months. 
First week side effects inc&#039;d but not lim&#039;d to: yawning, sweating (esp night), brain fog, nausea, hypomania, lack of focus. These only came back with cold turkey withdrawals (2 or more missed doses). Brain zaps, muscles seizing up and panic were common for withdrawal for me too. 
Lexy helped me minimise/blunt emotional responses and therefore improve cognition (could still cry etc tho), also boosted my mood noticeably but not intensely. This lasted a year before this med completely stopped working at all, eventual 20mg bump did nothing. Gentle first antid.. tapering off now, prob going for SNRI next."
