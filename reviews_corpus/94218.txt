"I started on 5mg and after a couple weeks didn&#039;t notice any changes and went to 10mg. Been on the 10mg for over a month now. I feel more calm and &quot;easy going&quot; now. I use to have panic attacks and anxiety and those are gone. 

For those experiencing nausea: I also have a lot of nausea soon after taking the pill, but I now take it right as I go to bed and I am not bothered by it at all.

Mild headaches sporadically.

Great alternative to what is on the market right now, especially for those with anxiety that don&#039;t want the sedation."
