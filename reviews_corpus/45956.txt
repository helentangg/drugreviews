"It works.  It wasn&#039;t the magic bullet for me (Wellbutrin was it for me) but I still take this in a 20mg dose to help with things.  Mainly still taking it because I was tapered down from 40mg which was giving me sexual side effects, while simultaneously upping the Wellbutrin, and have been stable ever sense so Dr just wants to let it be because it&#039;s working.  Going to ask for a reduction in this next time though as I feel that the Wellbutrin is most likely enough on its own at the high dose I am currently on (600mg).  This medicine is definitely worth trying and works for lots of people, just wasn&#039;t the end all be all for me personally."
