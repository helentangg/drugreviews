"I have had chronic pain/numbness/tingling sensations in the left side of my face for over 15 years. It was slight when it first started, but turned really bad around 2005. I have been on a Vicodin, Tramadol, Fioricets &quot;cocktail&quot; for 8 years. I tried Neurontin for 5 months but it made me sluggish, lazy, and depressed. Neurontin didn&#039;t solve anything. Last week a Neuroligist strongly suggested I try Cymbalta, and ease off all other presciption/non prescription pain killers. Within 24 hours I noticed a significant easing of pain sensations in the area of concern, and I have reduced my pain killer intake by 50%, and will cut it down to zero in another week to ten days. This happened in only five days of one 30mg pill a day. A miracle for me."
