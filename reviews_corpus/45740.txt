"I took Prozac for 6 years continually.  Started at 20mg/day and went up to 100mg/day at times.  My new doctor took me off of Prozac 2 years ago and put me on another medication.  I have gained 90 pounds in 2 years.  I am pulling out my hair again, intrusive thoughts.  I had no side effects from Prozac, no loss of sexual drive.  I LOVED (and still love) Prozac.  As a matter of fact I am going to the doctor tomorrow to see about getting back on Prozac!"
