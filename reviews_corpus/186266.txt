"I have been off and on meds for many years, I thought 120mg of Cymbalta a day was working, then I went to see another DR about racing thoughts and ways that I could end my life. So the DR and I went over my protocol with a fine tooth comb and he moved some things around. He put me on Pristiq (oh great another one to try) but this was different. I started with 50 mg and then to 100 mg within 48 hours. He also added Valium 10 mg 4 times a day and I feel great. Everything is changing for the good and I hope that you talk with your DR about this. The only thing bad I can say about this medicine is that I wished that I had found it sooner. "
