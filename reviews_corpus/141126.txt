"I was started in 5mg. No effect. Then went to 10 mg.  Oh my god I feel absolutely fantastic. Intrusive thoughts are easier to brush off a little bit of increased appetite and tiredness and that&#039;s it!! Brilliant. This is the only one that&#039;s worked for me!! I have been on sertaline and prozac and they were no good. Fab drug. Will be staying on this one."
