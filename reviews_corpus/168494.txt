"I too, had tried all the tricyclic&#039;s, SSRI&#039;s and SNRI&#039;s along with helper drugs for anxiety and insomnia. I went on Parnate 4 years ago and it&#039;s the ONLY drug that has consistently worked at keeping my depression in check. After a depressive episode that almost killed me, the decision was made to try it. There is no &quot;poop out&quot;. The MAOI diet everyone one freaks out over is NOT that bad - just be mindful of what you eat. Following instructions for safe use of this drug is nothing compared to the relief of clinical depression!"
