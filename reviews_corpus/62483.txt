"I was started on citalopram 3 weeks ago for chronic anxiety. My doctor prescribed 10mg and after a week bumped me up to 20mg. He said I can go 40mg depending on how I feel. So far I have had ZERO side effects and have been feeling a tad bit better each day. I still get anxious in the morning but by the end of the day I feel better. I&#039;m looking forward to when this medication kicks in. I have a good feeling about it. "
