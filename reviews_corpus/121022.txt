"I suffer from severe leg pain and all over body pain that Dr says it is fibromylgia. Anyway I started taking 75.Mg. Venlafaxine from last few days and feeling kind of good. Pain is little so I feel good. But all the people&#039;s reviews are scary. I don&#039;t know what to do. but this medicine is good for anxiety and pain. it helps a lot."
