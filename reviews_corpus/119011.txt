"I am 19 and was prescribed a small (10mg) dosage to start me off. I took it in the morning before my classes started. After an hour I began feeling nervous, headaches, upset stomach, dizziness, and I had uncontrollable shaking in my hands and feet. The doctors are starting me on something different, but will try Zoloft again at a later time. If it is your first time using Zoloft I highly recommend using it after work/school. I would really like to give Zoloft another try since I have seen great reviews."
