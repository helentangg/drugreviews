"I took Effexor XR after having my first episode of major depression. I have tried three times to discontinue Effexor and have had a recurrence of depression each time. As soon as I started taking the Effexor XR my mood stabilized within a couple of weeks and my life was back to normal. The only reason I tried not taking an antidepressant is because my profession will not allow you to take an antidepressant. There are new rules in effect now that allows us to be human so we will see how it goes. Effexor is not on the list so I took advantage of changing to an approved medicine. I hope it works as good as Effexor."
