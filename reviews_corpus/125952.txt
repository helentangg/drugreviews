"I think Viibryd made my liver hurt.  I started having weird pains on my right side under my upper ribcage shortly after I started taking it.  I stopped taking it because it didn&#039;t work all that well for my depression.  I noticed after I stopped taking it the pains disappeared completely.  I told my Dr. and he wrote me off as crazy.  Maybe I am crazy, but the pain coincided directly with starting and stopping Viibryd.

Another reason I stopped besides it not working that well was the cost.  It was too expensive for me and insurance wouldn&#039;t cover much of it."
