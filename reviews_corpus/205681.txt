"Pristiq worked well for me for 6 months on the 50 mgs than it stopped working. Switched to the 100mg and know its working again. Works really well for depression and anxiety. Makes you feel really confident, talkative, makes it impossible to orgasm and it does keep you up at night. Hopefully it won&#039;t poop out on me. When switching doses you have to give it at least 3 weeks to feel the effects. Initial side-effects do subside."
