"Had a few panic attacks, which later lead to constant panic attacks.  This caused Agoraphobia.  Suffered for 3 years and nortriptyline cured me from them 100%.  Stopped the Doom and the attacks.  I was on it 3 years and all was perfect.  Later, I tired many SSRI&#039;s and all on them seemed to induce or create panic attacks.  When I stopped the SSR&#039;s they went away.  I have been free from Panic attacks since.  It has now been 10 years clear.  Thank you nortriptyline.."
