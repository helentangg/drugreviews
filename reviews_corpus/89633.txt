"I have been dealing with clinical depression since I was in kindergarten (I&#039;m 41 now).  Have been on and off many different antidepressants over the years (mostly off because of the side effects and some making me feel worse).  Therapy never helped.  Have been on Celexa 20mg for last month- month 1/2 and it&#039;s working very well.  I have actually lost 11 lbs being on it because of loss of appetite.  The only side effects I don&#039;t like is increase headaches and decreased libido.  I do still feel sad and alone at times, but not as bad as I used to.  I am using Xanax a lot less too."
