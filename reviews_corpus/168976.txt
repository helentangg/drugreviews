"BEST ANTIDEPRESSANT EVER! I&#039;ve tried many different antidepressants in the past.  The only one I could ever tolerate was Pamelor.  Although it made me mentally foggy and I put on a lot of weight, I used it for 19 years, but finally stopped taking it.  Amazingly, I didn&#039;t fall into a depression for 4 years. Recently, however, I fell into a very deep depression after resigning from a job that I loved.  Being 61, I knew I had no chance of finding employment.  I finally sought the help of a physician who had me try Viibryd, as well as Valium for anxiety.  After completing the trial pack, I had ZERO depression.  The only side effect I had was a little stomach upset, which went away soon.  TRY THIS MEDICATION for one month. You won&#039;t be sorry."
