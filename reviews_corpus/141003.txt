"I just started Escitalopram 10mg three days ago for GAD.  Although I do feel a little nauseous and tired (which I can handle), my main concern is the feeling as though there is a knot in my throat that I simply cannot shake.  Is this normal?  I want to give this medication a chance to work, but don&#039;t know if I can stand this knotted throat feeling much longer.  Input please!"
