"I have had fibro for 18 years and have been on many medications. Being put on Effexor XR  over a year ago I have tolerated it well .. Maintained a healthy weight and it takes the pain from a 10 down to 2-3. My only complaint is that I have always had a sharp mind and I notice that I feel lost sometimes in what I&#039;m doing even in my own home .. Very loopey. I&#039;m 43 years old and take this along with 50 mg x2 of Tramadol every day. I would recommend it if you have fibromyalgia. It&#039;s worked better than all other snris or ssris out there."
