"Continuation from Alee:  I went to the ER and my potassium was low; now I&#039;m on potassium pills for 3 days. Today 6/16/17 I had my first panic attack in over a few weeks, my heart was pounding really hard and fast; my left side was numb, I couldn&#039;t breathe; so I showered and it calmed me down a bit. I&#039;m hesitant to start back on the zoloft...any suggestions?"
