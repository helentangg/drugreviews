"I was on Prozac for 10 years. It was a wonder drug for me. I had breast cancer last year and the Prozac stopped working for me because of the chemical changes in my body. I have tried Lexapro, Zoloft and now I&#039;m on Celexa. The side effects on the Celexa are horrible. I just want to find an antidepressant that works like Prozac. I stopped taking Prozac in April 2010 cold turkey and had no withdrawals."
