"I noticed I was constantly down, getting upset and was unable to communicate with people. I stopped going out and without realising I created my own bubble which I found hard to get out of. Even the simplist of things felt hard causing me to fall behind in work. I was then experiencing anxiety where I was so stressed. I knew somthing wasn&#039;t right when I found myself fantasising over jumping off a really high building so I didn&#039;t have to worry anymore.
I took myself to the doctors and he started me on 10mg of citalopram. The first week was hard. I still had suisidal thoughts. I couldn&#039;t stop yawning and had a dry mouth. After three weeks I started to feel normal again and things got easier. I still have down days but at all like before. :)"
