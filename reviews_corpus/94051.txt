"Mid 30&#039;s with depression for over 4 years.  Was on Lexapro 10mg then 20mg for a lil while, but it wasn&#039;t enough and the psych doc wouldn&#039;t listen to me or change my meds.  So after 2 years of dealing with him I switched to another psych doc who actually listened to me.  First she added Wellbutrin 150 then 300 XL, it wasn&#039;t such a great difference so she switched me to Brintellix after insurance approval.  She started me out at 5mg then titrated up to 10mg then 20mg.  The first few days were the worst with side effects, but mine were nausea and diarrhea, that only I got better in time.  The feeling after being on this medication was great!  I felt more like my old self again, happier, more motivated, less isolation, and got my sex drive back"
