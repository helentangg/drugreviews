"After 4 years of trying all the other anti-depressants I was put on Effexor. From the first day it was like the lights were turned on. If I go 2 days without I can&#039;t stop crying and is difficult to function. I don&#039;t have insurance and a low income so it&#039;s really tough at times. I feel like I need to increase the dose but  225mg is the max."
