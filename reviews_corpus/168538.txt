"Parnate is a great medicine. It will mess with your sleep cycle and cause severe insomnia but other than that it&#039;s great. It improves mood, lowers anxiety (not perfectly but enough), improves sex drive, it gives you energy and in my case I welcomed slight weight loss. I&#039;ve taken up to 40mg day. It&#039;s very important to take Parnate either in the morning or at 2pm. If taken in morning may cause drowsiness at ~2pm. TAKE FOOD WARNINGS SERIOUSLY. If I eat the wrong food my blood pressure definitely increases."
