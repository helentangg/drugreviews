"I was taking Zoloft 6 years ago because I had night panic attacks, bad dreams and I was feeling generally anxious.Can&#039;t remember did I have side effects.My sleep improve and I became different person, maybe because I hit puberty or because of Zoloft I don&#039;t know. I was another person.Happy.Not shy anymore.Did some pretty dangerous stuff.Nothing scared me at all.I was feeling great so I stopped.Then I start feeling anxious again and it get worse.Now,I have panic attacks not only during sleep but all day.I had them at home,car,cinema,gym,restaurant.I feel trapped,I&#039;m so scared and afraid I&#039;m going really crazy.Today I start Zoloft again.I took my first 25 mg.I will keep update.Hope it will get better."
