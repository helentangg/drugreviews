"This medication is NOT for teenagers.
My son was so depressed we could not get him out of his room for days on end.  We eventually got convinced him that he needed help and agreed to start taking medications and spending more time out in the sun and exercise.  All of this was painfully slow but I believe the medication did help him become more motivated to help himself.  He agreed to give the medication 5 weeks.  
Week 6 my son started punching holes in walls and throwing things when he has never done anything like this before.  Week 8 my son killed a little girl.  A friend of the family. 

Now, he is facing 47 years without parole for something he did at 17 influenced by a medication I had asked him to try.This is in fact, LIFE w/o parole."
