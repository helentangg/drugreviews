"LEXAPRO is the only medication that didn&#039;t have ANY side effects for me!
I am super-sensitive to all meds, had awful experiences with several of them.
My depression due to FMS faded within two weeks of taking 10 mg of the generic ESCITALOPRAM, that was over a year ago. I still have to take pain medicine, but at least I can cope mind-wise with all the issues FM throws at us. I have a slight problem with loss of appetite, but didn&#039;t mind loosing 10 lbs. over time and stabilizing at a healthy weight. I&#039;ll never stop taking it!"
