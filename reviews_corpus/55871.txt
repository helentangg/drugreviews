"I started with the 37 mg dose for mild-moderate depression I had experienced this past year.  I felt calm and peaceful for the first few weeks.  The doctor had me increase the dose to 75mg.  I tried for a month to adjust to it, but all I wanted to do was sleep.  It took away my energy and I fought fatigue.  I reduced back down to 37 mg and felt pretty good for a couple of months, but started to notice trouble responding to people around me.  It felt like being in a daze that took some effort to break.  I also started to feel out of sorts and frenzied.  I decided to stop the medicine a few weeks ago and feel 100% better.  No more confusion or anxiety!  This medicine was definitely not a good match for my body chemistry."
