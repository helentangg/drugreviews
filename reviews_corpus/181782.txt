"For years I struggled with depression unknowingly since I could remember never thought to take any action though until a few tragic events happened. Then came the suicidal thoughts and such so I went to a doctor and got this prescribed to me. Prozac 20mg, I can honestly say I have never felt so good in my life. Haven&#039;t had any suicidal thoughts or anxiety or very much depression. The only thing I can say negatively about this medicine is that it did decrease my sex drive and left me feeling quite tired and with a lack of energy when I first started taking it lasted about 2 days. Ever since then no such problems have occurred except for the lack of sex drive. Thank you Prozac you honestly saved my life."
