"After suffering in a very serious way from chronic neck and back pain for about 5 years, I was giving up.  I had no major injury, but small &quot;normal range&quot; disc ruptures protruding in my C5 and C7  with other old back injuries.  Fibromyalgia/Neuralgia.  I&#039;ve gone through multiple specialists, MRIs, physical therapists, chiropractors, and acupuncturists.  Some relief here and there, mostly with acupuncture and specific stretching.  Pain was horrible.  Finally after persistent research, I found what truly works for me:  Cymbalta (normal dose) with daily SAM-E and Malic Acid supplements.  It took about 2 months to fully work, but now I&#039;m virtually PAIN FREE.  Cannot thank God enough for this."
