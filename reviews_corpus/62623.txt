"I am a 24 year old female suffer of Bi-Polar and felt completely helpless and depressed all the time, that is until I started taking Citalopram. I now very rarely experience the &#039;manic&#039; periods, and my concentration and confidence levels have dramatically increased. I was only supposed to be on this medication for 6 months, however when I tried to go off them I hit rock bottom once again. I have now been taking Citalopram for over a year, and due the way it positively affects my life and relationships with family and friends, I am happy to stay on them for the time being. I highly recommend this medication for any bi-polar sufferer. (NB: I&#039;m on 40mg)"
