"I started Lexapro 9 weeks ago for mild to moderate depression and anxiety.  My doctor started me at 10mg a day and I&#039;m still taking the same dose.  Honestly, the first 3 weeks were tough.  No appetite, and very sleepy.  My head was in a fog and I couldn&#039;t think straight.  Then after the 4th week, I started to feel like my old self again.  The obsessive thoughts are very minimal now and I can get over things much better.  I sleep great now and feel good.  I recommend Lexapro to anyone that is suffering from depression and anxiety.  The depression is basically gone.  The anxiety is still there sometimes, but not nearly as bad as it was.  Stay patient, It works."
