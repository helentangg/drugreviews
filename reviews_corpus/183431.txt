"I took the strongest available dosage, so I felt the the effects right away. I only ever had one side effect, and that was insomnia. I would wake up every night at 2am and not sleep any longer. However this went away after 3-4 weeks. Cymbalta works well to eliminate depression, however you shouldn&#039;t drink while on it. The only other negative about this medicine is getting off it. Do not, under any circumstances stop taking it immediately. It swings you into an extreme depression. So if and when you stop, try cutting the pill in half for a while to lower the dosage and ease yourself off."
