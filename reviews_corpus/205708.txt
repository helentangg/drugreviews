"Started Pristiq 5 days ago after being on Wellbutrin for years. Had a series of events occur over the past six months that sent me into a deep, can&#039;t get outta bed, depression. I&#039;ve struggled with it for years. Thus far I&#039;m mentally much better, but feel drugged and super sleepy. I hope this is a temporary side effect and will eventually subside. I&#039;ve noticed other posts with these same initial side affects and saw where they DID eventually subside. Again, I mentally feel stable, calm and actual want to interact with others instead of crawl in a hole. This is a plus for me! Hoping things continue to improve. Definitely worth trying!!"
