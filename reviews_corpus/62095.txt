"I&#039;m a 27 year old male and I take this for anxiety &amp; depression. I went into a deep anxiety attack where my mind went into a dark state of mind and I couldn&#039;t seem to get out of it for about a week until the medicine kicked in but it was so worth it! I feel at ease now and I&#039;m not overly worried about every little thing anymore. The pros far out weight the cons, but here&#039;s the side effects that I experienced during the first week: nausea, insomnia, no appetite hardly and more anxiety. Thankfully about the 5th day into taking it, I felt like me again! I had this sense of joy and happiness that made me feel great. Some males say they had a sexual side effect where they couldn&#039;t &quot;climax&quot;, but I didn&#039;t have that problem one bit. Saved my life."
