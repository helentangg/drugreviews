"I&#039;ve started taking Zoloft for close to a month and a half and I&#039;m taking 100mg pills.

So far I&#039;ve had zero side effects what so ever and I sleep well most of the time. I don&#039;t really feel any different, it&#039;s like drinking water. So far it&#039;s had almost no effect on me what so ever negative or positive, it&#039;s practically as though I&#039;m not taking anything although I do feel VERY slightly more calm but barely, that&#039;s about it.

I don&#039;t have panic attacks when I&#039;m awake (only asleep) neither am I depressed. I struggle with extreme dissociation, paranoia, erratic behavior, rage, jumpiness and anger to sounds, anti-social, etc.

Maybe the dose is too small so my doc will bump it to 200mg and I&#039;ll post again."
