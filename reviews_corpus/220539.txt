"I started with cyclic vomiting syndrome when I was 14, and was in out of hospital for years. It got to the point I suffered with an episode every week with only 3 days in between, until I was 22. I then saw a doctor that had heard of CVS, and he prescribed Amitriptyline every night and Zofran when an episode started, since then, now I&#039;m 32, I have not had an episode. I still take Amitriptyline every night but it has defiantly stopped CVS and is a miracle for me."
