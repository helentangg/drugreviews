"I started suffering from migraines in my early 30&#039;s. I had tried everything you could think of. I was missing work 4-5 times a month. I ended up in th emergency room and was given Diloaudi several times (they call this percription heroin because its so very strong.  A few weeks back I went to another doctor who gave me Nortriyptyline! He told me my Migraines could be due to stress. For example, I know I have to go to work, I get ready, but then I decide to take the day off. I get a migraine.  I work well under pressure, so my brain gets amped up for one thing and it&#039;s suddenly changed.  Not that anyone asked for my medical history Ha. This medication works wonders!"
