"I am still in the early stages of using this medication. My fourth week. It has really helped with the back pain. Although I still feel pain, it is not continuous in all areas of my back. It is now just if I tweak the source. I did not heed the warning to avoid alcohol the first week and was very ill as a consequence.  I was vomiting for 2 days afterwards and very dehydrated. My own fault. I am going to speak to my doctor to see if we should add to the dosage to try and get rid of the pain completely. I am currently on 10mg per night. Although I don&#039;t drink much, I do feel that I don&#039;t have the freedom to choose if I would like to drink. So, this is the down side to this medication. However, I would love to get rid of back pain for good!"
