"I always knew I was vulnerable to having the blues, but it wasn&#039;t until I lost my motivation, could no longer enjoy the simple things in life (music, TV shows, vacation!)  and would randomly burst into tears, did I realize this was something more serious.  The first two weeks were brutal (1/2 tablet in morning, 1/2 tablet in evening). I was extremely anxious, had debilitating fatigue and zero appetite.  Third week the symptoms set aside and I was a bit better but still felt robotic.  Then the past 2-3 days, I noticed I was singing, joking around, MUCH less irritable and wasn&#039;t haunted by negative thoughts of doom or self-loathing.  My memory is even better. Give it a fair chance, I promise you won&#039;t regret it."
