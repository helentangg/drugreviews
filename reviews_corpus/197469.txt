"I&#039;ve been on Paxil for  approximately 15 years now, and I absolutely believe it has saved my life.  After only about 2 weeks, I had the first &quot;good day&quot; I could ever remember having.  Until taking Paxil, I never realized that people could actually be genuinely happy.  There have been a few times during the first 5 years or so when I tried to stop cold turkey.  The side effects were really awful and I almost immediately went back into severe depression.  I&#039;ve since just accepted that I&#039;ll be on medicines the rest of my life. Small price to pay for the benefits.  However, I think I am in the minority in that I didn&#039;t experience any particular side effects while on Paxil; only when trying to stop."
