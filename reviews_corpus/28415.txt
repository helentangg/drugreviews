"I&#039;m 30 years, have been suffering from depression on and off for years. This year, I came down with a hard case of Seasonal Affective Disorder, which rendered me a useless ball of fear every day from the afternoon onward and eventually led to other problems (digestion, neurological, and otherwise).
My doctor prescribed 10mg escilatopram. Goodness, I wasn&#039;t expecting much, but I feel absolutely fantastic now. I&#039;m happy and can focus on daily activities, even in the dark winter evenings. 
Also, I&#039;ve been on it for almost 2 months now, and I haven&#039;t noticed any side effects! No digestive or sexual problems which seem to be not-so-rarely reported."
