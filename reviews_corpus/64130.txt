"I started on 50mg. The day after my first tablet I felt super nauseous and broke out in a cold sweat and had to lie on the floor, that lasted a few minutes and I felt sick throughout that day. First few nights I struggled to sleep. These symptoms soon went away. I went up to 100mg. The only symptoms I have had throughout taking this medication is night sweats, pretty gross, and it&#039;s harder to climax. 

It took a few weeks, but after being on this medication for nearly a year I can honestly say I&#039;m like a different person, more outgoing and carefree. I don&#039;t care what people think of me like I used to constantly. I&#039;m happy in my own skin! I&#039;m scared to come off this medication incase I go back to feeling terrible."
