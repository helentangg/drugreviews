"I am 14 y/o, female and currently take 200mg of Zoloft. 
The first 3 months I was on Zoloft I felt so free, happy, able to approach people with ease and engage socially. (might have been placebo) This feeling wore off, and even when I tried going up on my dosage multiple times, it didn&#039;t change anything. 
Zoloft has given me so many health problems. As told by a doctor, Zoloft caused a decrease in my iron level, which gave me Anemia, which I have never had before. I struggled with weight loss on this medicine, which is hard since I already struggle with trying to gain weight. 
I&#039;m still on this medicine, and this is my 5th month taking it, but I may have to go off on it for medical reasons, and I feel it doesn&#039;t do my anxiety any justice."
