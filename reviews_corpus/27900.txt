"Been on this for roughly 3 weeks. I started taking 10 mgs but I&#039;m currently only taking 2.5 mgs. The first week was a lil bad. I took at night and the med kicked in in like 3 hours. I couldn&#039;t sleep, had increased anxiety and it upset my stomach. I cut down to 5 then 2.5. Now I&#039;m fine,  panic attacks are pretty much gone (before I was getting them daily sometimes even 2 or 3 times). The attacks were starting to interfere with work n life n I had to get some help. I tried working out n eating better but it wasn&#039;t helping. This works but it takes time. Also, I take this in the mornings with food. It gives me energy so taking at night wasn&#039;t good for me bc it would keep me up. Start with a low dose so your body gets used to it."
