"I&#039;m on 40mg a day, did take sertraline, mirtazapine now on these, don&#039;t think they do anything to me, doctor says he don&#039;t know if I got bi polar or schizophrenia lol, that&#039;s what u get for being honest. did stop them once for week as thought doing nothing, never felt so ill in my life if that&#039;s a cold turkey. I&#039;m 35 anyone else on 40mg? "
