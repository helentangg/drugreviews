"I started on lexapro in my early diagnoses with depression it worked but then I became immune to the drug. Then my psychiatrist recommended Effexor which also worked for the short term. However that was in the early years. For the past few years I have been on pristiq I started on 50mg which did a good job of controlling the anxiety and lifting me out of depression, last week my psychiatrist upped my dose to 100mgs so see how I go with this. I am also on epilim 1000mgs daily as well as 200mgs of seroquel for sleep disorder. I think taking extra pristiq will help though see how I go."
