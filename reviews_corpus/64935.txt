"This helped my panic attacks stop, but helped with depression none. This medication made me feel &#039;flat,&#039; and like I was not living in the moment. For example, when people talked to me I could not associate emotions with the conversation. In addition, this gave me stomach irritation, made me lethargic, and never worked at the 4-6 week mark."
