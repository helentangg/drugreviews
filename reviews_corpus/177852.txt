"I absolutely love Cymbalta; it&#039;s a miracle for me. My anxiety, depression, and spinal pain have all been reduced or gone away. I also lost weight and could eat anything I wanted. After 6 months, I switched to Celexa to save money. Big Mistake. I started gaining weight, and it didn&#039;t have much effect on anxiety or depression. I switched back to Cymbalta, and am happy again."
