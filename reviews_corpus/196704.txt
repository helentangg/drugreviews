"I started taking Paxil for anxiety and depression and started feeling sick on first pill.  Nauseous, headaches, trembling, body shocks etc.  After the second pill I found it was starting to get hard to orgasm.  By the forth pill I couldn&#039;t orgasm and quit taking it at that point.  Not ready to give up sex to possibly get over some anxiety and depression, but seriously if the side effects are this bad after 4 pills what would a month be like.  Then after stopping after 4 days it was like the whole process in reverse as I has gotten over the headaches and sickness after 2 days, it took another 2 days to get over it once stopping.  I am going to try something else or just go back to self medication, at least the side effects are more manageable"
