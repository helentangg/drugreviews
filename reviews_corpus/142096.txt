"I&#039;ve always been somewhat emotional, but at the age of 16 I was feeling really sad. I have been on Lexapro for about 5 years now, first 20 mg and eventually upped to 40 mg daily. At 19, I started getting panic attacks and high anxiety. My doctor put me on Effexor XL, which caused weight gain and made me feel worse. I was switched to Welbutrin 150 mg daily and the combination of Lexapro and Welbutrin seemed to help. The past few months, I have been upped on Welbutrin to 300 mg. I have to say, Lexapro doesn&#039;t come in generic and is VERY expensive, especially with no insurance. Don&#039;t forget to take your Lexapro, because the withdrawal can be bad."
