"I&#039;m a 33 year old male and have been on Lexapro for a little over a month now. The first day I felt like I drank tons of coffee..I felt good but wired. Then I felt tired all the time for the next following weeks. But for the past week or so I have been feeling awesome, more confident, talkative, happier but still very sleepy. It&#039;s great because I actually sleep the whole night but its so hard to wake up. I get to work late sometimes. I tried switching to taking it midday but by 7pm I&#039;m ready for bed. I&#039;m still happy and love it but the drowsiness and yawning are irritating because I want to do more with my evening."
