"Took this as I was having bad anxiety and insomnia, waking up early constantly with that uncomfortable tight chest feeling and just having no energy.  Seemed to work for the first 3 days, then I got really depressed.  I started at 5mg and went up 5mg a week til I hit 20mg.  I have been super depressed, more anxious, was extremely nauseous and could barely eat for almost 2 weeks, and my sleep hasn&#039;t improved at all.  After almost 4 weeks on this stuff, I am a mess and don&#039;t feel like myself at all.  Weening off and trying something else.  I got up to 15mg.  Tried to get to 20 but just felt too horrible."
