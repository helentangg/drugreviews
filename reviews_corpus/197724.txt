"I&#039;ve been taking Pristiq 50mg daily for the past 7 months for anxiety and mild depression, and I can&#039;t say I&#039;m much better for sticking with it.  The side effects were horrible as I started - extreme dizziness, nausea, restlessness, sweating, impotence.  Those subsided over the first week or two, but quickly returned if I miss a dose.  My energy level has not lifted and in fact may have decreased, but most importantly I&#039;ve felt more disconnected, numb, and unfocused since being on the drug.  I&#039;ve heard it&#039;s rough to come off and I&#039;ve been tapering back slowly, but I&#039;m looking forward to clear thoughts and true feelings again.  "
