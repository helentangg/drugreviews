"Chronic severe pain from fibromyalgia, Crowns, degenerative disease, arthritis and more. Just went to see a new psychiatrist and he prescribed 50mg nightly for depression and anxiety. I am almost pain free. I can&#039;t believe all the docs I&#039;ve had over the years never thought of this. It is definitely is worth talking to your doc about it is truly a Godsend !"
