"My Doctor started me on Xanax.  It helped with anxiety but it was a take as needed. I felt like I was waiting for a bomb to drop waiting for that lost feeling.  My Doctor switched me to Lexapro.  I&#039;ve been on it for a week now, and I feel like my old self.  I&#039;m amazed, and so is my family with the difference in my mood.  I feel so grateful."
