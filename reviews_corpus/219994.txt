"Life changing medication!  Why I hadn&#039;t been prescribed amitriptyline years ago I cannot understand but after years of living 3 weeks bad out of every 4 in excruciating pain and the dreaded (D) I now have at least 98% better quality of life .....don&#039;t get me  wrong  I have odd days when I will have pains and to use the term my gastroentorologist used (explosions), but compared to life before ,its totally manageable .I Started  on 10mg at bed time but upped it to 20mg and this works better, no adverse side affects and I have been using about a year now. Naturally suffering from I.B.S I watch  what I eat carefully and everyone&#039;s different but for me it&#039;s really helped"
