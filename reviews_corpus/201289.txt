"This medication has changed my life over the past 5 wks I&#039;ve been on it. I take zoloft for severe anxiety; I have always been a high stress, high functioning over achiever. I started having all kinds of odd stomach issues, heart palpitations, I hardly slept, etc. With this medicine I feel MUCH less stress and anxiety with every day things. I am more patient more relaxed. I started on 50mgs for 2 wks and asked to increase to 100mgs and been on that for 2 wks too. I take ativan and hydroxyzine as needed. This medication has changed my life!! I have lost about 10lbs on it. I think some of my appetite was anxiety driven. But I love this med and this has made me a better person!!"
