"I was struggling depression for 19 years. I always held everything in and never told anyone, so I&#039;ve tried to hurt myself a couple times. Finally 4 weeks ago I admitted myself to a hospital and they sent me to a mental health place where I stayed for 2 weeks and was put on Celexa. I was scared to get on but knew I had to do something and I am so glade I did. I feel like a whole new person without the stress and wondering where my life&#039;s going. Thank you Celexa. Now hopefully I can get insurance and stay on it."
