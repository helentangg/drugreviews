"I have nothing but amazing things to say about Pristiq. I went through a 5-year toxic relationship, lost everything including myself, tried to rebuild my life after leaving him but could not stop feeling &#039;heavy&#039;. Felt numb. Had anxiety, could not sleep and pretty much felt like I was living in the dark. Went to see doc, started with 50 - no side effects so after 2 weeks he upped to 100mg and after three weeks I started to feel better and after a month I was truly amazed. Its been just over three months and I feel better than ever. I can&#039;t believe I suffered for so long.  Sometimes, despite our best efforts, it just isn&#039;t enough! Best thing I ever did for myself. Thank god for health benefits! Its expensive!"
