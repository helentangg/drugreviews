"I&#039;ve recently suffered a relationship breakdown. My anxiety eventually spiralled out of control to the point I walked out of my job, life &amp; all &quot;responsibilities&quot; to return home like a child.  OCD negative thoughts, inability to go 2 days without crying, constant fear of anxiety returning, weight loss and inability to sleep / function basically LIVE!! I was SO scared of the horror stories but at rock bottom there&#039;s nowhere but up right? I have been on 5mg for 4 days now. Taking it before bed. First night very nauseous, the next day feeling tired, teary &amp; &quot;distracted&quot;. However, I have noticed a general improvement in my mood after 4 days. A good day yesterday and terrible today. BUT! I&#039;m persevering. Thanks all for positive stories. :o)"
