"Cymbalta saved me.  I was in a state of constant recurring anxiety with many physical symptoms such as vomiting every morning, shaking, and over feeling of panic and disassociation.  My thoughts were swirling (due to a very stressful situation) almost constantly.  I started on 30mg and noticed an improvement within 2 weeks.  I still had some anxiety in the mornings so my dose was increased to 60 mg.  I have 0 anxiety now and am able to more calmly and clearly work through stressful or worrisome situations.  I had very great reservations about any kind of medication and only decided to try because I had no options.  It has been a godsend for me and I have had zero side effects.  Don&#039;t rule it out, it may save your life."
