"First 10 days were brutal. STICK THEM OUT! Lots of people seem to have an initial period of getting used to this drug. My first 10 days I was unable to eat, nausea, anxiety increased to a point I was barely able to leave the house, crying for no reason. Just stick it out. Day 10 through about 6 weeks I noticed not much improvement. At about 6 weeks I noticed improvement in my anxiety, able to function much better. My anxiety disorder has only improved more and more since I&#039;ve been on this drug (also seeing a therapist for anxiety). Just know there may be an initial period of terrible side effects. I&#039;ve gained like 2 lbs, but it&#039;s due to being happier &amp; having a new boyfriend because I am finally able to function as a normal person."
