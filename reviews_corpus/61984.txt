"At first I was prescribed Zoloft 50mg which I cut in half to 25mg. I&#039;m sensitive to medications and this being my first SSRI it really threw me for a loop.  Severe derealization and anxiety that lasted all day.  So I quit the Zoloft and was put on Celexa and Buspar, the Buspar is useless for me. I once again had bad derealization. So after giving the Buspar two chances I gave it up. I started Celexa at 10mg. First day samething, derealization, anxiety, etc. So I cut the pill in half to 5mg, helped me get used to medication really well. I now take it every night at 8pm. I&#039;m currently taking 15mg, about to take 20mg after 3 more doses.  I&#039;m starting to feel emotions and connections with myself that I haven&#039;t felt in years. So far, so good"
