"I&#039;m a 33 YO female, and this is my first time being on any kind of anti-depressant.  I&#039;ve been on Lexapro 10mg for about a month now.  I noticed an immediate increase in energy, and even felt a little jittery.  The doctor said it typically takes 2-3 weeks for it to fully kick in, but some people notice a change within 24-48 hours, which was me.  I have decreased appetite and a lot of foods upset my stomach, so I&#039;m eating less as well.  Subsequently, I&#039;ve lost some weight (which I like since I need to lose some!)  I feel like doing things again and actually have some sort of sex drive, which had been completely absent for a while with the depression.  I&#039;m sleeping better, and it&#039;s easier to get out of bed.  So far, so good."
