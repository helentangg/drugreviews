"I&#039;m currently on 150mg of venlafaxine taking every morning and evening, I noticed immediately my social anxiety is gone and I haven&#039;t had a panic attack in years. The down side for me is that I find the withdrawal symptoms if I miss a dose by accident absolutely horrible, electrical zaps in my head, pins and needles in my lips, dizziness when moving eyes or head, nausea and extreme anxiety and panic. I would recommend everybody to never ever miss a dose. I also find it hard to remember things and concentrate, my memory has worsened which is hard while at university. I feel tired a lot more of the time and have a lot of muscle twitches and extremely vivid dreams. Though I feel that these downsides are worth it as it works so brilliantly."
