"I&#039;m actually writing this review on behalf of my wife. If you are bipolar, please stay away from this medicine. At first it seemed to help relieve the arthritis pain, but two months later the side effects became a nightmare and the pain increased threefold. It took another three months to clear it from her system, now she is doing much better but has short term memory issues. "
