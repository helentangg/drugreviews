"I have suffered depressive illness/anxiety since my teens; parents had depression and bipolar, genetically very prone, battled feeling &#039;not quite right&#039; for 20 yrs. It took a suicidal day last November for me to seek &#039;help&#039; via specialist who knows this area. Was given Lexapro, balanced my highs or lows but it took 3 month to feel the effects, returned to boxing 2 x week, cut down drinking and eating. I&#039;ve lost 5kgs and another 7kg be back to my perfect weight. One day at a time and manage it the best you can."
