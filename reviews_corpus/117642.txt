"I have suffered with A-typical facial neuralgia for over 12 years and nothing but nothing has helped me like Nortriptyline.  I was prescribed this by a professor of Pain Management at Walton Hospital and I can honestly say he saved my life. It is a wonder pill that seems to work alone. Previously I was on a cocktail of Tegretol, amitriptyline and gabapentin which completely left me like a zombie. After being &#039;pain free&#039; for 7 years,  I began to wean myself off them but only recently the pain has begun to return so I&#039;m going go back to the doctor for my script.  Sometimes it&#039;s better to carry on taking the tablets even if you think the pain has gone as they cannot cure you, they  merely mask the pain, which is good enough for me."
