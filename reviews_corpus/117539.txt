"I never write reviews but for this drug I feel like I have to! I have tried so many drugs, herbal supplements, chiropractor, massage, acupuncture etc. have been hospitalized before for my migraines, and at some periods had them everyday.  I thought if this is the reality of my life being in pain everyday, what is the point? This is the only drug which works and has almost no side effects except for at first a dry, nasty tasting mouth which has gone away for the most part.  It took a couple days to kick in and I&#039;m on a very low dose of 10 mg which I take at night.  It&#039;s been almost a week pain free! I feel like a new person and it finally feels like the miracle I&#039;ve been looking for, so don&#039;t give up!"
