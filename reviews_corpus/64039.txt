"I have taken sertraline for some 15 years now for depression caused by hysterectomy...had never had depression prior to this surgery.  At any rate I began at 50mg and never had any difficulties with this medication and I am very sensitive to medications.  My depression lifted completely within 3 weeks of my start.  I have attempted remove myself from the sertraline with my doctor&#039;s okay...however within a month my husband recognizes my depression and when I am alerted to it I realize I have become very depressed, not happy, find nothing to be good in my life...so I went back on it at 25mg a day and that has worked very well.  I believe my brain chemistry changed after my surgery...it is what it is and I am glad this med. is available."
