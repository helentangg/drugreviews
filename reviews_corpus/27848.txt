"My rheumatologist put me on Lexapro for both depression &amp; fibromyalgia, after Cymbalta stopped working for me. I started it two weeks ago Tuesday &amp; I absolutely love what it&#039;s doing for my depression &amp; anxiety but hate that it&#039;s caused me to gain at least 5 lbs already. I&#039;m going to try to stick with it for another 4-6 wks, but if my weight continues to increase, I&#039;ll have to wean off of it. I dread weaning off of antidepressants."
