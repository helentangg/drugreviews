"I have always been a huge stressor ever since I had my first son. I was 17 and after I had him I suffered from postpartum depression. I would cry all the time and started suffering from panic attacks shortly after. I did not try antidepressants until I was about 22, then started Zoloft. Took an edge off but no re-life of anxiety. Today  I am 32 still a sufferer of stress and depression . Been taking Prozac 20mg for 5 months - huge difference. My husband says he can tell. I don&#039;t have outburst and I only cry when I should. Not at the drop of a hat. I try not to stress over little things and just had the best Christmas ever because I did not think of suicide like I have in the past. I was actually happy and thankful to be here."
