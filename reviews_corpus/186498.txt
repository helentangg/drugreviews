"I started Prisiq on 3/22/10. The main side effects were not sleeping well and night sweats. This lasted only about 4 nights. A bit of nausea, not enought that I couldn&#039;t handle and that was it. I am now on my 3rd week and I am doing fine. I do feel much better, and have more energy, since before the Pristiq, all I was doing was sleeping. If someone has never taken an antidepressant, the side effects can be alarming. I went cookoo and no sex drive on Zoloft and Cymbalta. Pristiq, whatever is different about this SRNI seems to keep me at an even keel. I will give Pristiq at least 3 months before I give a full report."
