"Been taking Zoloft for 2 weeks and 3 days for panic attacks and general anxiety disorder. 2 weeks in I felt like myself again, careless towards things that didn&#039;t matter and was able to go to work and be more social. For 3 days now I&#039;ve felt strange, had a panic attack though on day 14 and I think that might be why (can&#039;t get over them sometimes). I can&#039;t wait for a month to be over with so I&#039;ll get the full effect of Zoloft. Hopefully I&#039;ll be back to normal soon."
