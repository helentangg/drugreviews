"I wish somebody had told me how addictive this drug is before I started taking it.  Had I known how bad the withdrawal symptoms were, I probably would never have gone on it.  (Although that might be a good thing, as I need(ed) to be on it.)  It has definitely helped.  The worst thing is HAVING to take it...literally.  It&#039;s a full-out physical addiction.  If we go somewhere and it doesn&#039;t get packed, I&#039;m in trouble.  It&#039;s NOT something to be taken for short-term or seasonally.  Other than the withdrawals the main side effect is sweating.  I shower every morning and by mid-afternoon I have to put Kleenexes or some sort of absorbing pad in my arm pits!  In the past 17 years, I&#039;ve also been on Paxil, Celexa, Prozac, Lexapro, and one other."
