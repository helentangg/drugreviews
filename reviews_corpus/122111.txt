"I was prescribed Effexor after a major depressive episode and being diagnosed with general depressive disorder. I started at 75 mg of the XR and a few weeks later increased to 150. I can&#039;t even tell you how much better I felt. I know that some people have problems with this medication, but that&#039;s how it is with any anti-depressant. The only side effect I had was increased sweating, which was annoying, but was definitely outweighed by the positive effects. The only issue I had with this medication was a decrease in effectiveness over time. Eventually I had the dosage raised to 225 mg and I stayed with that dosage for a year and haven&#039;t had any problems."
