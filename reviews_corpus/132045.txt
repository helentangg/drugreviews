"I&#039;m 19 years old and have been on Effexor for about 2 years now. The day before my High School graduation I went on it after having a huge panic attack and finally being diagnosed with anxiety (surprisingly I never knew I had it). This has given me my life back. I can&#039;t remember when my last panic attack was. I&#039;d recommend it."
