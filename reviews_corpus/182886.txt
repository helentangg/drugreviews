"These pharmaceutical companies need to figure out ways to engineer better medications. I went on cymbalta for about 8 months after a long struggle with anxiety. I had mild depressive episodes as well, but it didn&#039;t really bother me and mostly came as a result of having bad anxiety that I felt I couldn&#039;t control. Cymbalta was great at first, I seemed to actually lose a little weight (didn&#039;t need to but any girl likes to see that) and I had a great mood much of the time. However, I started noticing that it wasn&#039;t doing anything for my actual anxiety. It started making me gain weight, I was too tired from the medicine to go the gym, and had a hard time even making it to the library to study (I&#039;m a college student)."
