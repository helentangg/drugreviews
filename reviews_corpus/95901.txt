"65 year old male. Started having panic attacks mid-July. Sense of doom, cardiophobia, fluttering in chest, loss of appetite. My internist diagnosed panic attacks and started me on Sertraline @ 25 mg./ day for one week, then up to 50 mg/day. I had some mild nausea and diminished libido for a few weeks, so doctor reduced dosage to 25 mg. where its been for 3 months. After the first 10 days or so of starting this medication anxiety and panic attacks became history. I feel like I got my life back. This drug worked wonders for me and I am thankful that my doctor recognized the problem and prescribed the correct treatment."
