"I&#039;ve been on 10mg for 8 months.  Within a week, I felt the &quot;cloud&quot; lift and things seemed clearer. I wasn&#039;t wired or feeling speedy at all but I was able to focus on things and get on with my life.

When I started taking it, I was taking it in the morning and I would have bad diarrhea. I was worried that I would have to discontinue use.  Over time I found if I took it in the evening on a full stomach, usually about an hour after dinner, I didn&#039;t get diarrhea.
