"I started on Viibryd after having a DNA test done where I found out other medications  aren&#039;t effective for me due to the way my brain processes them. The first week was fine with no symptoms and no noticeable changes. When I went up to 20mg I had terrible crying spells, couldn&#039;t sleep at night, had muscle aches, insane migraines, was exhausted, irritable and my anxiety worsened. I lowered myself back down to 10mg and the symptoms lessened. My doctor told me to take the medication with dinner and a full meal. After reading other reviews, the symptoms may have been so bad since I wasn&#039;t taking the medication at the exact same time each day. On 10mg I can function but feel as if I&#039;m not on any medication at all. I&#039;ll be switching meds asap"
