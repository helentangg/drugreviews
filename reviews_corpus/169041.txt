"I&#039;ve been on quite a few medicines the last 14 years. Zoloft, Prozac, Paxil, Wellbutrin, Lexapro, Xanax combination, Effexor to name a few. My doctor started me on Viibryd a week ago I&#039;m on 10mg and tomorrow I start the 20mg. So far this pill has been a lifesaver. I haven&#039;t had any side effects that many people speak of. I heard you got to eat with it and the key is protein because it helps the pill absorb into your system. I&#039;ve been very happy and positive but not too happy as some pills will do. So far it has been the best depression pill I have tried."
