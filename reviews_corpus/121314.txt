"Diagnosis: a Chronic Clinical Depressive with a 40 year history who does not react to meds in a typical manner. After 6 months of juggling meds weekly at the clinic, finally got relief with a daily dose of 150 mg Effexor XR. Have not had Any episode of Depression since 2003. The side effects are  more than tolerable as a tradeoff  to be the happiest people on this planet instead of in perpetual hell."
