"I was prescribed Effexor XR about 2 years after my mom passed away and it was the like the miracle drug for me.  Then about 9 months ago I received the generic substitute for Effexor (Venlafaxine) and I had this debilitating nausea and threw up every single time I took it.  Feeling this daily wiped me out and it caused problems for me at both of jobs.  I am highly upset about this change and want my EFFEXOR back.  I hear that I am not the only one this generic &quot;substitute&quot; has affected this way."
