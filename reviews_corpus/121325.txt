"Effexor XR is the best thing that&#039;s happened to me since my life went to hell in a hand basket a few months back. It dragged me back from the edge. And I was lucky, I started improving at the 2 week mark. Most people take up to a month to notice a difference. (Although those 2 weeks waiting were horrible, especially since I didn&#039;t know if it would do anything). 
What it&#039;s helped with: severe depression, severe anxiety, panic attacks, and that heightened startle reflex. 
Side effects I experience on 75mg: night sweats, occasional shakes (these have gotten less over time), and occasional nausea (again, less over time). There have also been some seriously vivid dreams/nightmares, but I&#039;ve also got PTSD. *shrugs* Could easily be either."
