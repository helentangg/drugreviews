"Was originally prescribed Citalopram 20mg a day for anxiety, however I have suffered from premenstrual symptoms for years, it was controlling my life! For weeks I had side effects but persevered. I have NEVER felt so good since, I have zero side effects and absolutely NO signs of PMT! My husband thinks he&#039;s married &#039;me&#039; again! So happy."
