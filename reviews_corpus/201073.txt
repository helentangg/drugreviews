"Took this for anxiety and depression but found out later that I actually had severe PMDD. I had to stop taking Zoloft after six months due to bad vertigo but it definitely helped the PMDD symptoms. Switched to venlafaxine and found that to be great, but first three days are so hard. Headaches, low mood, heavy feeling in head and body. It worked though. 
Zoloft also fixed my restless leg syndrome which had not responded to any other treatment."
