"Hi, I have obsessive compulsive disorder, post traumatic disorder and depression.  I have tried many different medicines over the years and I had high hopes for Viibryd.  But After beginning my fourth week on it, I have been disappointed first by not feeling it has been helping my mood or depression at all, second by it seeming to be making my OCD (compulsive cleaning worse) and third by some really bad side effects when I jumped from 20mg (week 3) to 40mg (week 4) dose.  Side effects were really bad nausea and explosive diarrhea.  Diarrhea so bad I had 2 accidents in my pants and nausea worse than what I went through during chemotherapy after having had cancer a few years ago- thank goodness I kept an old anti-nausea medicine in my medicine cabinet.
