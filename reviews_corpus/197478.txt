"I have only been taking Paxil for 9 days now. I really can&#039;t tell much difference except I feel a little better. I have read what others have said and it seems promising so I&#039;ll keep taking it so maybe soon I can function. My anxiety has pretty much taken over and I don&#039;t leave the house without another person to drive in case, it&#039;s terrible. With any luck soon that will no longer be an issue. I&#039;ll come back in a week or 2 and let you know."
