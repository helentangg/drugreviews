"I started taking sertraline a month ago. So far it has worked great. I no longer feel the way I use to. I use to be on edge, get overwhelmed,  irritated easily,  constantly worried. Somedays I still get anxiety nothing compared to how it use to be. I feel like the old me, I too was skeptical about starting it but I knew I couldn&#039;t go on feeling the way I did it was really taking a toll on me. I am so glad I started it. I started with 25mg and am now on 50mg no side effects for me."
