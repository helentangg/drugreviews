"Doctor switched me from Viibyrd to Brintellix. I was on 10 mg. of Brintellix, but went down to 5mg as my heart was beating way to fast and my new lenses in my glasses went way bad on me. My eyes still aren&#039;t back to normal, but will give this medicine another chance at a lower dose. I could not go to sleep with the 10 mg. my brain would not stop thinking, my legs hurt so bad and I just tossed and turned all night. Now on 5mg I go to bed when I get totally tired ( midnight ) and get up around 8AM.I lost two married daughters in 2011 ( four months a part ) to suicide. Brintellix gave me headaches to begin with and caused blurred vision, but both are subsiding now. Just give this drug a good try. It may be just the perfect drug for you."
