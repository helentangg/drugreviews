"I started taking this medicine when I was 24 years old for social anxiety. I hated meeting new people, felt intimidated easily, threw up on my first day of every new school semester and my mind was always racing. I was constantly thinking of scenarios in my head to prepare myself for whatever may come next. Started on 10mg then 20mg. The first night I experienced numbing in my left hand. In the following days I was having a hard time falling asleep, yawning whether I was tired or not, and for the longest time my jaw was always clenched. I also had a loss of appetite. Lost weight at first. Sex drive was terrible and say bye to orgasms for awhile. Now after a year, I feel human and no side effects at all! I have much more confidence!"
