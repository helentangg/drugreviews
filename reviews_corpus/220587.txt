"I have had chronic upper back pain for almost 15 years and have tried diazepam, ibuprofen, tramadol and finally codeine. The codeine were the main ones which worked but I noticed I began taking them when I had no pain and realized I had become dependent very quickly with awful withdrawals when stopping them. My doctor had also prescribed me with Prozac for PMDD which gave me an irregular heartbeat. She decided to take me off codeine and Prozac and give me a low 10mg nightly dose of amitriptyline instead. What difference they have made. I&#039;ve believed for a year that only codeine would work for pain and they helped with my mood too. How wrong I was! Amitriptyline keeps me pain free and I sleep like a baby and wake up feeling so refreshed!"
