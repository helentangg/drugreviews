"It was prescribed for anxiety &amp; post traumatic stress. It helped with that in addition to my mood. I am set at 150mg. When I first started off, it was 25mg, the first few days were a challenge. But I got over the hump. Now I&#039;m planning to get off of it. I don&#039;t want to be dependant on this medicine too long."
