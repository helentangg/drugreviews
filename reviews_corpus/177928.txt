"I was on Cymbalta for 2 years and found it to be a wonderful relief of pain and anxiety.  The problem I had with it was &quot;brain zaps&quot; and dizziness if I made any sudden movement with my head.  I weaned myself off of it slowly and am now back to suffering with pain and anxiety but I do not wish to take Cymbalta again due to the strange brain effect it has.  Getting off of it was extremely difficult and luckily I was between jobs or I could not have made it to work during that withdrawal period.  Extreme &quot;brain zaps&quot; were the worst thing to get rid of. "
