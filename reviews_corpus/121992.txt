"Effexor helped me to relax, although it was a trade off. I had continuous headaches and heartburn. It started with nightly headaches. Then that turned into an everyday thing, I would have to take migraine medicine before bed. After I started doing that I would wake up from heartburn! I never have heartburn. This medicine is definitely a trade off."
