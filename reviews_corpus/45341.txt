"I&#039;ve been taking Prozac since I was thirteen years old or so. I&#039;m sixteen now, and I&#039;m worried that if I ever stop, I&#039;ll get bad again. I have severe anxiety and had depression. The depression has gone away, but the anxiety has worsened. Not from this medication, but I believe I need a larger dose. Anyways, this drug has helped me and made me feel like it can get better. Knowing the chemistry in my brain is really helpful too, to know that serotonin is being released. I would recommend for severe depression, but not anxiety unless at a larger dose. I&#039;m on 40mg now, but took 20mg up until a month ago."
