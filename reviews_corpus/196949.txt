"Paxil is going to effect everyone differently. What worked great for me, may be the worst medication you&#039;ve ever tried. I&#039;ve been on Paxil for 20 years and for a large majority of those years, Paxil really helped me with my anxiety. I&#039;ve been back and forth between 15-30mg many times. I never had any major side effects from it (not libido, not weight gain). The thing with Paxil is, there&#039;s the potential for what&#039;s called &quot;Paxil poop out&quot; (yes, it&#039;s real, Google it) where the Paxil stops being effective. I was completely unaware of this so I was totally blindsided with debilitating anxiety and horrible panic attacks out of nowhere one day. I was really bummed because Paxil had done so much good for me. It&#039;s a great med when it works."
