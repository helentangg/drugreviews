"I was on venlafaxine 75mg for the past month and boy was that a crappy drug. Felt more sick than ever and didnt want to get on it ever again. Fast heart rate , raised my blood pressure and almost made me black out while riding my bike. Resting heart rate in bed before sleeping was 100-120 . Weaning off of it as of now, 1 week to go. Doctor gave me zoloft/sentraline which I was given a few years ago (helped me so well) I&#039;m pretty happy with my life. I no longer think of my ex who cheated on me and left me for another guy, and no more suicidal thoughts. I FEEL HAPPY! Every drug effects and helps everyone in different ways. I noticed change in the first week. I&#039;m on 50mg right now and Im so happy :) Takes time guys! LIVE ON ,LIVE HAPPY"
