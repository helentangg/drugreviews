"I just wanted to post my experience with lexapro. I have been on it for about four weeks and it has changed my life for the best. Before I got prescribed this medicine I was going to bed crying and waking up crying. Couldn&#039;t keep up with my Mother duties cause I was scared I was going to die and was having horrible panic attacks. I have not had any panic attacks since the end of the first week and I have not had the nausea feeling since week three, so I am doing way better. Didn&#039;t really have any other side effects from the medicine. I can&#039;t wait to I see my doctor so I can thank her for saving me from anxiety and depression."
