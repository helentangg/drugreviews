"I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia about 1 yr ago, Dr. prescribed Cymbalta, got discouraged at first because it didn&#039;t seem to help in the first couple weeks, but then after staying on for about a month, pain was greatly decreased. Not a fan of being on medicines, but without it my quality of life is not the same."
