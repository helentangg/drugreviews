"Wonderful medicine, but beware of withdrawal if you have to get off the medicine. I had to when I lost my insurance and I had severe withdrawals ranging from brain shocks (feeling like on a constant merry-go-round), severe nausea, suicide thoughts, anger outbursts, extreme confusion. These lasted for about 6 weeks."
