"I was put on Viibryd for depression. My husband and I had a miscarriage and I became depressed and suicidal. That was my breaking point. My doctor put me on Viibryd and at first it helped wonderful. I have been on the 40 mg for 5 months now. I have headaches almost everyday, have gotten light headed a few times one day but my depression did get a lot better."
