"I suffer from episodic depression and anxiety attacks. Pristiq is the only medication for depression that I&#039;ve tried that has virtually no side-effects either getting on or getting off. When I begin taking it (I&#039;m on my 2nd round with this medicine since it came out). I almost immediately (in 2 to 3 days) start feeling better, or at least &quot;normal&quot;. It certainly doesn&#039;t make me feel happy or like dancing, but it does erase feelings that I wished I&#039;d never been born. Which is wonderful! I do have occasional night sweating, especially if I take any other medication with the Pristiq, even something like Advil. Getting off the Pristiq last time was uneventful. Only some slight dizziness upon moving my head for about a week."
