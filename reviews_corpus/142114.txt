"My girlfriend has been on Lexapro for less than a month and she&#039;s already shown a drastic change in her attitude. At 1st she was quite difficult but now she&#039;s happy 98% of the time. She no longer talks about suicide and she&#039;s actually able to hold on a conversation without shutting down and getting depressed. Thank you Lexapro...you saved our lives!"
