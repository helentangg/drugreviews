"Chemotherapy brought on Bipolar disorder and several years of meds and regular sessions of therapy has made me feel some what normal. I take 300mg of Effexor, along with 800 mg of Seraquel. My side effects are some memory loss, thirst, and fatigue. I do have an issue with staying engaged. However, my unrealistic fears are not something I think about as often, and my anxieties are minimal. I had some income issues, and I did not take my meds, all my symptoms returned. I suspect that I will need this drug for my entire life."
