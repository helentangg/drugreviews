"Male, late 40&#039;s.  Earlier summer events created extended stress that eventually broke me.  Every morning I&#039;d wake with sweat rolling down my neck, lost my appetite and the worst-case scenario of everything played in my mind.  I&#039;m normally the &quot;rock&quot; that everyone turns to.  Started with Wellbutrin for 2 weeks but that left me with heightened anxiety.  Spent a couple weeks on Propranolol / Klonopin but that &#039;s not a long term solution.  Started 10 mg Lexapro (generic) and after 5 1/2 weeks, nothing but crazy emotional swings.  Switched to 20 mg and after about 2 weeks noticed a distinct change.  Greatly reduced symptoms so far.  Skeptical as I was, this stuff actually works."
