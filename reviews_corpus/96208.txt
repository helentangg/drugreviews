"I&#039;ve been taking Zoloft for about a year and a half now. I previously used Celexa, Lexapro and Paxil.  So I gave Zoloft a try.  Without a doubt, 100mg Zoloft once daily has been a blessing for me.  My moods are much more stable.  My urges to pull my hair, my obsessive compulsive behavior  and my anxiety/panic has dropped dramatically. I used to worry myself sick about every little thing. So much so, that I would feel anxiety before the most mundane of events such as standing in line at the movies or other things that no rational person would panic about.  No major side effects to mention other than I find being in direct sunlight for extended periods makes me feel like my skin is crawling.  Small price to pay for my sanity, peace of mind and my happiness."
