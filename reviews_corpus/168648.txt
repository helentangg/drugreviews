"I was on effexor and it was working well, but the excessive sweating and near total loss of libido were too much. I started viibryd and I think it might be The One for me. The depression is better than ever, anxiety is down, sex drive is even higher than it was before I started effexor. The only side effects were diarrhea that went away after a few days on 20mg, and dry mouth which is only a slight bother."
