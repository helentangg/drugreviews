"I was initially scared to go on Zoloft, as I had been on it when I was 12 for depression and I was told I was a despondent zombie. I&#039;m 18 now and have probably taken 10 different antidepressants. Two months ago I began having horrible intrusive thoughts, and this was the first drug recommended. I agreed to try it after some pushing from my doctor and more experimentation. The first two weeks was hell; I couldn&#039;t keep anything down. I lost 18 pounds in two weeks. My OCD is better but it&#039;s still not great. I had periods of derealization when switching doses and some of it has stayed. I&#039;m currently on 100mg and probably going to up my dose."
