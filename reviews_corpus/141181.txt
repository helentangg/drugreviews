"Please, please don&#039;t take this.  My PCP prescribed this after the death of my Father - duh that&#039;s when you are supposed to be depressed and anxious!  In addition, she mismanaged my thyroid condition which allowed me to become hypo - which also, for me causes, depression and anxiety.  I took one 10 mg generic lexapro pill and immediately felt heaviness in my head, stomach upset, and nausea.  In addition to that I had no muscle strength in my legs.  The next day I realized that I didn&#039;t need these meds and stopped.  3 days in and I&#039;m finally not as dizzy but did start throwing up on the third day - which is about 2.5 mg of meds in my system and haven&#039;t slept since stopping. Can&#039;t wait until next Saturday when this poison is completely out of me."
