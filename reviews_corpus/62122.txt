"I need help. I&#039;m 16 years old and I&#039;ve been struggling with depersonalization and derealization. It started after a massive panic attack and during the panic attack my body felt numb my heart was going crazy my vision also went weird and after that nothing&#039;s been the same I fell very detached and like I&#039;m in a dream. I went to my GP and he prescribed me 10mg of citalopram with 50 mg of stresam. It&#039;s now day two and last night I woke up sweating and felt as if I was twitching I also have stomach pain and I feel very anxious and scared that it won&#039;t work and I&#039;m very panicky about taking it after reading the side affects I can&#039;t stop over thinking and I feel I&#039;m on the verge of having another panic attack I&#039;m so nervous and I need advice."
