"I&#039;m in my early 30&#039;s and never had a problem with depression or anxiety until I lost my mother to cancer 18 months ago.  I fell into a depression after that and my doctor prescribed me generic lexapro for short term depression ( as it has never been an issue).  I noticed within 2 weeks that I felt better...I had more energy, etc.. Not liking the idea of being on meds, I weaned off it after 6 months.. I still had withdrawal symptoms (electric shock feeling).  Well after that my husband left me and that combined with the loss of my mother was too much to bear. I was miserable. I only left the house to go to work and it was difficult to pull myself out of bed.  As soon as I got home I would throw on pj&#039;s and just lay on the couch. PAGE 1 of 2"
