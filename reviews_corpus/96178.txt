"While sertraline is undoubtedly effective at leveling out emotions, it could be said that at times it almost gives you &quot;zombie-like&quot; symptoms; I took the medication for my anxiety (combined with a traumatic event/post traumatic stress) and it was very helpful getting over the initial situation and forgetting it; however, for anxiety itself, it made me somewhat dysfunctional on its own, and I lost some of my drive and ambition. I started on 100mg, and have since gone down to daily 25mg tablets combined with 150mg of Wellbutrin XL daily, which in my personal opinion is a far more effective medication in that it doesn&#039;t tend to slow down the rate of someones introverted thought. Sertraline made me less emotional, in general."
