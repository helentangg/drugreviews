"I have never been able to take any kind of antidepressant comfortably. I was put on Elavil to start, at 50mg after three months was raised to 100mg always taken at night of course. I was pretty depressed about several issues in my life, not the least of which was the fact my father was dying/died. I also take meds for anxiety/panic disorder, as well as pain, I was disabled before 1994, when I was hit by two cars; already disabled, this made the pain from fibromyalgia worse as well as messed up my spine and neck, etc. Now when I run out of the small amount of the anti-anxiety medicines, I don&#039;t have a meltdown like before. I do get sleepy, miss the tail end of movies I want to see, I have the dry mouth yes, however the trade off is worth it."
