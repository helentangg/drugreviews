"I&#039;m 38 and I&#039;ve been on Pristiq for about 3 weeks now. The depression has lifted, but I still have anxiety. I take Norvasc for high blood pressure (my blood pressure has been controlled for years).  My blood pressure feels like it is getting higher as I am on this drug. I was having wine at night on this drug, but I am going to stop doing that and maybe it will lower my blood pressure. I really don&#039;t want to stop taking Pristiq. I&#039;ve lost 5 pounds. I&#039;m starting to worry about going to the Doctor all the time to &quot;change my medicines&quot;.  I feel like I&#039;ve tried so many.  I just want to feel NORMAL for a change.  "
