"I was crippled with anxiety, depression, and nagging intrusive thoughts. Zoloft has allowed me to live again. Please don&#039;t allow the stigma and misinformation out there about antidepressants prevent you from getting help and finding relief. Once your body adjusts to Zoloft (this can take upwards of 2-4 weeks), you will find relief and peace. I used a pill cutter to cut the prescribed dose (25 mg) in half and took the half dose for two weeks. Then I increased it to the prescribed dose. This is much easier on the body. Please consider doing this so you&#039;re not overcome and discouraged by some of the initial side effects. Good luck friends."
