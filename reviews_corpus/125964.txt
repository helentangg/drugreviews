"I&#039;ve been on Viibryd for a month just finished my starter pack with dosages ranging from 10mg-40mg. This is the best medicine out there for me. I&#039;m on top of things, being diagnosed with anxiety, Major Depression and ADD. I take numerous medications. This has been a life savor only side effects I&#039;ve experienced is gas and diarrhea in the morning, I take mine at night to help with sleep since it makes me so groggy and fuzzy minded. I&#039;ve been on 20   different medications and Viibryd has surpassed them all. I would recommend this to anyone with a major depression or obsessive compulsive disorder."
