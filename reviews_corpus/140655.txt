"This has changed my life so much.  I have been on 5mg for about 10 days.  So much calmer and much less PMS which I&#039;m in right now and feel fine.  I had extreme anxiety, wanted to flee work for some reason, could barely drive 2 blocks without high anxiety, crying all the time, creating panic attacks.  I&#039;m  50 so I think it&#039;s perimenopause. That&#039;s what my OB said when she prescribed it.    I had low anxiety before but this was insane.  I&#039;m so happy I feel better.  I did try Prozac before for 3 days  but that increase my anxiety and I had intrusive thoughts on it. Now Just a little tired on. 5mg Lexapro generic version at first but it seems to be getting better. And some dry mouth.  Overall I mentally feel relaxed and calmer!! ."
