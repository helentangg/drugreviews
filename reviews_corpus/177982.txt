"After 3 years of crippling lower back pain and radiculopathy from L-5 spondylolysthesis, I tried 60 mg of cymbalta : complete game-changer. I experience slight nausea a few times a week, but that&#039;s all. I&#039;m back to being a happy, nearly pain -free dad. If I hadn&#039;t tried this, I would be facing  surgery by now.  What a blessing."
