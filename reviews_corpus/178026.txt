"I have been taking Cymbalta for depression and have been on it for almost a month. I have noticed a change in my mood. I am starting to feel better about everything. I don&#039;t feel like I&#039;m walking around in a fog anymore. I felt really tired for the first couple of days and mostly slept, but now I&#039;m feeling much better. I haven&#039;t felt any other side effects. I have taken other medications for depression, Paxil, Celexa and Effexor. Paxil and Effexor didn&#039;t work for me at all and the Celexa worked for about a year and then, didn&#039;t work at all. I hope that Cymbalta will keep working for me, because I don&#039;t want to change medicines again. Cymbalta is working for me already and I hope things will become even better the longer I&#039;m taking it."
