"This medication actually works for migraine prevention. I take only 30 mg a night, and I really didn&#039;t expect much. The first week I still had migraines almost every day, but then after that, I almost never get them...not even close. I haven&#039;t experienced any side effects except for tiredness in the beginning, and that&#039;s a good thing. It helps me relax before bed, and not living with constant pain is a blessing. Also, I&#039;m on 450 mg of Wellbutrin but was still depressed; this tiny dose of Nortriptyline for about 3 weeks has made all the difference and I&#039;m happier. Actually, if I had to say one bad thing about it, it&#039;s that it&#039;s made me crave sweets like crazy...I&#039;ve gained 5 pounds. Otherwise, great med."
