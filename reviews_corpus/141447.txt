"I&#039;ve been on the medication for about 6 months now. I used to be one of those people that frowned upon others taking these sort of medications. Until one day, out of no where, I was struck with major anxiety, which then caused me to become depressed. I&#039;d avoid social gatherings. I&#039;d have complete nervous breakdowns about meeting up with friends. Every morning was a battle to go into work and face my colleagues. I started drinking heavily. If I had to go out, I&#039;d take a shot to calm my nerves. I went to the Dr. and she prescribed me. Ever since taking the medication, I&#039;m pretty much back to who I used to be. I feel free again. I&#039;d recommend this to anyone who suffers from anxiety or depression."
