"I struggled with depression, mood swings, and incredibly severe anxiety at a very young. Effexor is the only drug that worked for me. I went up to 150mg and that really helped me control my anxiety and depression. I became more outgoing and was able to enjoy life in a way I hadn&#039;t been able to before. The one con with this medication is the withdrawal, which is severe. If I miss a dose I experience fatigue, powerful electrical shocks throughout my body, and I become very withdrawn and &quot;out of it&quot;. I switched to taking 2 doses; one 75mg at night and morning. I switched recently to pristiq to see if it would &#039;t have this side effect, but it does (although, less severe) and it isn&#039;t as effective. I will be going back to Effexor."
