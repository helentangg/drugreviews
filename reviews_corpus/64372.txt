"I&#039;d been doing very well after I quit drinking and illicite drugs over 10 years the my mother came down with cancer and I helped her through hospice and besides physical health problems I was diagnosed with depression. The dr put me on the 50 mgs generic zoloft and I didn&#039;t emediately feel a change but my fellow workers at my job did first and asked if I&#039;m alright? Your not getting angry anymore. It&#039;s helped for about 5 years as my wife and I have been going through some serious medical problems of getting older.  About a month ago I would just start breaking out in tears as I would be driving the car of at home watching TV for no apperent reason I could find. I asked my doctor if increasing it would help and it has after about 3 days!"
