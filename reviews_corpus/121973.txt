"This medicine was God send, I didn&#039;t know how much it had helped until my Dr switched me to Pristiq. I became VERY DEPRESSSED! Dr put me on Zoloft, then Lexapro, Saphris, Abilify and Seroquel. Six months later and after nothing working I got put back on Effexor four days ago and I am already starting to feel better! I have come to terms with taking a medicine for the rest of my life if that what it takes to feel normal."
