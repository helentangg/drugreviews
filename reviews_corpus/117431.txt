"I thought I&#039;d share my experience as I was madly reading all the reviews on this website before starting this drug. I get it on the NHS in the UK and I take 20mg a day. Taking this drug and combining it with the plan in Dr David Buccholz&#039; book Heal Your Headache has been the closest I&#039;ve got to a total cure for my chronic severe migraines. There are almost no side effects. It&#039;s amazing. 

A word of caution. At one point when I tried increasing to higher doses above 20mg I had very bad mood swings for a few days. Even when I started from 0 to 10mg I had very bad mood swings for a few days but then it evens out and becomes unnoticeable."
