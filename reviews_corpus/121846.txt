"I have been on Effexor for 18 years.   Yes, that&#039;s right: 18 YEARS.  It saved my life and then some.   I had very severe clinical depression back in 1995.  I was suicidal and anxious to the nth degree.   Effexor has brought joy back to my life and has enhanced my creativity and sexual desire.  I have been blessed with this medication.  It was the first anti-depressant my doctor prescribed and most likely the last.   A match made in Paradise: Effexor and I."
