"I suffered with social anxiety for many years.  My neck would get red blotches when I had to be the center of attention.  Zoloft along with alprozolam has helped me tremendously!  I always thought I had to live with this and there wasn&#039;t a cure.  After researching the internet, I found out what I had.  My husband also takes Zoloft to control his depression, withdrawal, anger and road rage and it helps him sleep really good.  One drawback is that it made us both gain weight, but that has leveled off.  I hope my post helps someone else out there."
