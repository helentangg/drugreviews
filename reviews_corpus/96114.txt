"I started taking sertraline 50mg a week ago for anxiety. I have already noticed a difference in my mood and am able to control my anxiety. I haven&#039;t had any panic attacks. However, I&#039;ve had to miss work due to side effects: nausea, loss of appetite, and diarrhea. No other side effects noticed. They say these should go away. I am going to keep trying it in hopes."
