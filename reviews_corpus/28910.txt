"This drug is an absolute miracle. I have/had severe anxiety from menopause and was losing time at work as well as my general interest in life. Heart palpitations, chest pains, dizziness and shortness of breath. I thought I was losing my mind. I&#039;m taking only 5mg a day and have no side effects. I&#039;m even losing weight. I&#039;m back to normal. What a HUGE relief! I would recommend this drug to anyone suffering as I did."
