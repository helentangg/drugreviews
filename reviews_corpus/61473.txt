"I suffered my first panick attack in 2015 after finding out I still needed two more classes to graduate college. I&#039;ll never forget laying on the floor, not being able to breath, and feeling like the room was closing in around me. At the request of my immediate family, I went to talk to a doctor and realized I had been living with anxiety for quite awhile. My doctor prescribed 10mg of Celexa. I was a little tired the first week or two, but that was the only side effect I experienced. While the 10mg helped some, I still felt a little edgy at times when I really shouldn&#039;t have. My doctor upped my dose to 20mg and again, a little tired the first week or so, but I&#039;ve been golden ever since. I&#039;m me now without the anxiety, thanks to Celexa."
