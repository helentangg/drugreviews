"I took Citalopram for a little over a year and it was the first A/D I&#039;d ever taken.  Worked wonders and helped me to enjoy the little things in life again.  I&#039;m a busy Mom of littles and needed the help way before I actually admitted.  I&#039;ve always had TMJ from wearing braces in my teens, but never anything real painful.  It wasn&#039;t long before I realized the new pain in my jaw was from clenching, bruxism.  Saw Ortho for opinion, dentist made me new bite splint, cortisone shots in jaw joints, heating pads, so on and so forth to help with pain because I didn&#039;t want to get off Citalopram.  It got so bad that I had to stop. Been a few months, starting over on Sertraline.  Fingers crossed!"
