"I&#039;ve always had generalized anxiety &amp; social anxiety ever since I can remember, but I would still push myself to go places like mall, Walmart, or just walk out my front door, not knowing what was wrong with me. So around 17 I dropped out of school, &amp; started working as a cashier, did good &amp; managed to control my anxiety, until I&#039;m 18 now, and here come the panic attacks &amp; agoraphobia kicking in. I hated leaving the house &amp; just being around people period. So I quit my job; I went to the doctor he put me on Paxil 10mg, then Paxil 20mg didnt do anything, then Zoloft 50mg then 100mg a month later. Overall my mood is much better/calmer. I&#039;m still a shaky mess in public &amp; even around people."
