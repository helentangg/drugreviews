"Been on Sertraline for 3 weeks now,50mg/day.
First 3days I felt very up,happy inside,great feeling. Then for 2 days a had an constant headache.Then for 3 days I had aches and pains down my back and the back of my legs,like restless legs,my skin was tender to touch on back and back of legs,almost flu like.
Then after that I&#039;ve gone back to before,irritable ,snappy, short tempered, no motivation, don&#039;t want to talk to anyone,low sex drive and low appetite,thirsty all the time,stomach problems, today I&#039;m feeling sick but not sure if it&#039;s a one off.
I have my next appointment in 1 week and not too sure if I should continue on the 50mg or up it to 100mg a day as the doctor said we start off at the lowest dose and can triple it."
