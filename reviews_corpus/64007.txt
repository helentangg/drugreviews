"I&#039;ve been on Zoloft for nearly two years now. I have anxiety and depression and it&#039;s worked WONDERS to reduce it.
I&#039;ve gradually increased the dose and now I&#039;m on 150mg. The difference is HUGE.
Me off Zoloft= Crying, paranoid, mess of a human being.
Me on Zoloft= Joyful, outgoing human being with a sense of humor who can finally enjoy life!
Also, the side effects are basically nonexistent. When I first started it, everything kind of made me want to throw up, like a morning sickness-type thing, and I lost like 5 pounds. Now, that&#039;s not a problem, it&#039;s gone.
As far as side effects go, Zoloft is one of the least problematic antidepressants you can take.
So it&#039;s worked for me! It&#039;s changing my life."
