"I suffered from anxiety and chronic depression for over 20 years. Got a doctor , she started me on Ecitalopram and with in 5 days i noticed a difference in my anxiety. I felt hungover for the first couple days i started on 5mg. After two weeks, i upped to 10mg, and felt hungover for another 2 days. After that, I&#039;ve been great for 2 months. My sleep was a little jacked for the first month, but overall this has been a huge benefit for my life. I&#039;m consider myself lucky because I know that not everyone&#039;s experience is so smooth, but it&#039;s definitely worth trying if you&#039;ve never got treatment before."
