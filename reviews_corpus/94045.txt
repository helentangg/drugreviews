"Female, 46yrs, depression for ~10yrs. I went on Trintellix 10mg at the end of January and from the very first day, I&#039;ve been dizzy and nauseous. Yesterday, the nausea was at its worst. I also take Vyvanse 50mg for ADD and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg for high blood pressure plus another BP med. Shortly after going on Trintellix, I started to develop bruising on my upper thighs as well as itching. I think as I scratch, I end up bruising and it looks awful. I contacted my doc and am still waiting for a reply. Hopefully, I&#039;ll be taken off of it and will go back to Cipralex and Wellbutrin even though my libido has improved somewhat. At least I&#039;m not crying at the drop of a dime as happens when I don&#039;t take any meds at all. Good luck everyone!"
