"absolutely horrendous - I don&#039;t understand how anybody can take these drugs. All it did was put me in a fog and laid awake for hours on end. My doctor wanted me to try something besides Ambien, because it causes dependency - big deal - at least I can get some sleep. The only plus would be the cost - 13 cents for 30 pills. Not worth it though."
