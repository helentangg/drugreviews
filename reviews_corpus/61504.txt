"Been on Citalopram for 2 and a half months now. For the first week it gave me bad lower jaw pain for a few hours after taking and woke up several times in the night, but this did quickly settle. Also during day 2 and 3 I felt completely numbed to the world as if in a daze, but during week 2 felt like I had awoken a new person. For the next 3-4 weeks I felt on top of the world and like I could do anything. My anxiety is mostly in check but over the last 2 weeks I have felt my depressive mood swings taking hold again at times. Might need to go back for a higher dosage.
Other than that only lasting side effects are muscle twitching before I fall asleep, and I do sometimes wake up for no reason though can quickly fall back to sleep again."
