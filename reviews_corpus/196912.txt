"Hi after nine months of anxiety and depression I though I finally fought through it when an event led me to spiral down again. Realizing I had nothing left to fight with I decided to listen to to some who&#039;d been telling me to try something. I can&#039;t really rate this because I&#039;ve only taken my 4th dose but so far no side effects that aren&#039;t manageable. I am trying to keep the negative self talk at bay and to recognize how my anxiety is leading me to make bad choices which then lead to depression and the cycle goes on. At least that&#039;s what I think is happening. I know a lot of people said they felt immediately better and that it was from the meds but for me I think it is more of a peace in deciding I can&#039;t live like this anymore. I am hopeful"
