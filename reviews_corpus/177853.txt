"My depression/anxiety the past several months has been disabling.  Mornings were filled with crippling anxiety/depression and I&#039;d stay in bed to escape being with the emotional pain.  I felt overwhelmed all the time and just couldn&#039;t get motivated to do anything.  Since Cymbalta, I have pep in my step!  I have tons of motivation to spends HOURS cleaning a house with years of accumulated hoarding, and to clean my apartment which I couldn&#039;t touch in 6 months.  I can get things done without the overwhelmed feeling -- bills, job, etc.  I&#039;m no longer deeply blue and crying.  This is an answer to my prayers!  My psych said that my desire to get better, counselling, and making changes is what is needed as part of treatment to succeed.  Praise God!"
