"I was put on this for anxiety. The first 3-4 days I was fine, just a little tired but then experienced the worst panic attack I&#039;ve had in years. The daily anxiety continued after that and I was taking my as needed lorazepam almost everyday. I contacted my doctor and she suggested taking half. I tried that and was ok for 4-5 days and bam the anxiety and panic returned. I never had problems sleeping but I would wake up with a racing heart almost every morning. I made it 3.5 weeks before my doctor and I decided to switch to something else. I feel like this medication made me feel worse. The  pharmacist said I shouldn&#039;t feel increased anxiety that long it&#039;s usually just the first few days."
