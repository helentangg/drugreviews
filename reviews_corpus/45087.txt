"I have been on meds for depression, anxiety and pmdd for over 10 years.  Even on Zoloft I would cry at work all the time over little things, take everything personally, Finally, there was a suicidal ideation breaking point for me and I went off Zoloft and on Prozac 20 mg.  Within a few days, I felt the depression and sadness lifting. 2 months later, still not depressed.   My psychiatrist just upped my Prozac to 30 mg and I&#039;m having trouble sleeping through the night.  Overall I feel less emotions and don&#039;t care as much about work and other things.  I don&#039;t react strongly to anything. However, I&#039;m tired a lot and feel much less motivated in all areas of my life. It&#039;s better than being depressed &amp;stressed."
