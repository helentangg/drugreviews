"I suffer depression and post traumatic stress, anxiety, suicidal thoughts ruled my life for the last 7 years. I was prescribed Lexapro and although initially it helped me, it didn&#039;t make me feel that life was worth living so I went off them about 18 months ago. I didn&#039;t hold too much trust in doctor&#039;s abilities to &quot;fix&quot; me either, but I had to visit a doctor recently before I finally went through with just giving up on everything that I found overwhelming. The doctor prescribed me Pristiq 50mg and I owe either the doctor or the makers of this drug for saving my life.  This tablet has sorted out my head. I don&#039;t have constant thoughts and stresses running through my mind all day long, I can finally breathe and enjoy MY life again. Good luck to you all."
