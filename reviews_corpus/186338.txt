"I felt much better on this medication, but found it had unfortunate side effect.  After ruling out the 2 other medicines I was on for other conditions, I found out it was the Pristiq that caused major photo-sensitivity. I basically had to stay out of the sun all last summer. I developed blotches and nausea after just a few minutes in the sun.  Being depressed and not being able to go outside doesn&#039;t work.  After weaning off it, the symptoms subsided.  Lively to be outside again, but now must try a different medicine."
