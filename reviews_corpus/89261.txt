"HATED IT! I have anxiety and I thought this would be great for me until I tried it and I took a pill in the morning, later that night at 1 a.m I woke up with the most awful panic attack in my life.  I was scared, I was freaking out about my baby for no reason, I cried for hours and I didn&#039;t know what I was doing and I was fighting my thoughts in my head. Luckily my husband stayed up with me as I cried myself to sleep for 3 hours shaking and all my muscles were completely tense.  Celexa heightened my anxiety And made me suicidal. DO NOT TAKE CELEXA!"
