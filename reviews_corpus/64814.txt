"I was on Zoloft in my early 20s, but never found it very effective them. Fast-forward 15  years and every other anti-dep med later, my Celexa pooped out on me and I started having daily anxiety and panic attacks. 

It took nearly eight weeks for me to feel any positive effects from the drug. The start-up side effects were terrible - I was sick for weeks. However, when I was switched to Zoloft (150mg) from Celexa, they cut me off Celexa cold turkey and ramped me up to 150mg within four weeks. It was hell. Side effects: sleepiness, anxiety, depression, jaw clenching, dizziness, panic attacks, diarrhea, loss of appetite. Side effects hung on for at least the first four weeks. 

I&#039;m about three months in now and feel much better. 90% normal."
