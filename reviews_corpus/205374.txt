"I&#039;d been on Prozac for 5 years and its effects had started to wane. I was severely depressed with anxiety and extreme tiredness. I was going to bed at 7pm and had to drag myself out of bed. Everything felt completely overwhelming. I sat with the prescription for about a month. Some reviews I&#039;d read had me terrified. It got so bad I thought there was nothing left to lose. I decided to ensure I&#039;d never run out and I&#039;d take it at the same time every day. I had a migraine at the very beginning so drank more water and I am feeling great. The best part is increased energy. I feel like a normal person. This has been a lifesaver. Would recommend if you have debilitating fatigue."
