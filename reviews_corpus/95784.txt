"I&#039;ve been on sertraline for about 6 months now and I have started to notice I am much more confident in social situations and outside the house.  I suffer with Bipolar 2 and anxiety and often won&#039;t leave the house because of this anxiety.  My social anxiety is much better on sertraline compared with other SSRIs.  It has made getting to sleep more difficult, but I tend to take the tablet mid-afternoon which helps.  It&#039;s had no effect on my trichotillomania and not a huge effect during my depressive periods.  The mood stabilizer lamotrigine has been a better antidepressant."
