"This drug has honestly changed my life. I suffered from PMDD for years and the mood swings had a terrible impact on my life. In the two weeks before my period I would fluctuate between feeling upset, paranoid, anxious, and ragey - falling out with family and friends - and sometimes not wanting to get out of bed or go to work. My doctor suggested taking 10mg Lexapro a day for the two weeks before my period. I wish I had done this sooner as it really has had such a positive impact. The first fortnight I took it I had bad nausea and a lack of appetite for the first few days but this symptom reduced each month subsequently and now I have no side effects. I feel really stable and like myself now and no longer fear that fortnight before my period"
