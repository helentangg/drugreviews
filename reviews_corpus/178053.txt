"I am going back on these! I have an appointment and it can not come soon enough. I slipped back into depression gradually and feel numb and do not have interest in anything. It scares me to be like this!  When I was on Cymbalta before the side effects did fade, mostly dry mouth and tiredness. I took them at night and it helped. I felt I wanted to try medicine free because after 2 years felt better. Well one year later and I am depressed again! Going back on them! The withdrawal symptoms did not bother me, I weaned gradually.  Wellburtin XL worked for me too, I lost a lot of weight on that one! GOOD side effect."
