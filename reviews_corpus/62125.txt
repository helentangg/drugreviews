"I&#039;m 29 years old...(Mother of 2 boys) I lost my grandma (who raised me) on June 10th (My birthday). She was my everything. This is the first time I&#039;ve experienced losing someone this close to me. I&#039;ve had a very difficult time dealing with is, crying everyday....and it has affected me at work with having less patience for things...anxiety, etc. Which I already had anxiety at night before she ever passed away. I&#039;ve been on Celexa for 5 days and I haven&#039;t cried since then. It has made me feel more calm....more understanding of things. My anxiety has subsided a great deal....the only down side is I&#039;m having a little bit of insomnia which I know is a side effect. I&#039;m optimistic about the future now. "
