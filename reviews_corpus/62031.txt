"I&#039;m 26 years old and have been suffering from health anxiety. Every time something hurts or I get a gas bubble in my chest I think I&#039;m dying and will have a panic attack for hours. It was putting a strain on my life in everyday possible so I sucked it up and went to the Dr. Also, I have a fear of taking meds so this wasn&#039;t easy. I decided to take my 10mgs at night after reading about drowsiness, yet I do not get drowsy. The morning after my first pill I woke up with what felt like a terrible cold that only lasted till the next day. I was sneezing like mad which is something I never do. I know the Dr. said it would take weeks to work but I&#039;m telling you I feel great. The things that once terrified me now have no power over me."
