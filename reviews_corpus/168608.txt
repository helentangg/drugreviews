"My dr gave me two sample packs and told me to take all the 10mg tablets and once I was done I could go up to 20mg if I needed it, but I continue to get a prescription for 20mg and cut them in half so it lasts me twice as long. She told me I would have upset stomach the first night and that was literally the only bad side effect I had! I take it after dinner/before bed. Right away it made me feel more awake, able to handle things my stressors better, and gave me a general sense of well being. I can still get aggravated so I don&#039;t feel like a zombie, and I&#039;m still able to have the big O. I am 36 and have tried 10 or so different antidepressants over the years since I was in my late teens and nothing has ever worked as well as this."
