"At 56 years old and being raised to &quot;put on a happy face&quot;, I can finally say I feel happy and emotionally alive. Depression had consumed me for 35+ years. I was a hollow shell. Talk therapy did nothing. Once the Dr. discovered the brain had damage to the neurotransmitter/receptors and started me on slowly increasing doses of Effexor XR the depression cleared. I now take 150mg daily. There has been no negative side effects. It&#039;s been 3 years now. People who know me well are extremely supportive; those who don&#039;t know my &quot;history&quot; would be surprised learning I take an antidepressant. Only rated as a 9 because long term/life long use is unknown still."
