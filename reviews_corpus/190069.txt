"I had Irritable bowels ever since I was a young teenager and I just couldn&#039;t figure out what was exactly wrong I thought it was menstral related . I suffered for years until I was about 40 years old dealing with cramps in my bowels ( lower abdominal area) I realized after I had a hysterectomy it wasn&#039;t my endometriosis I still had this cramps feeling every day! :(
I started taking desipramine , a fiber pill (citrucel) and a probiotic (align) and I haven&#039;t had hardly any issues ! I am like 95 %better . Sometimes if I feel a little crampy I drink a morracan mint tea and it settles things down really quick . I got lazy one week about taking this regimen and I got so irritated . So I know it works and I&#039;m sticking with it ."
