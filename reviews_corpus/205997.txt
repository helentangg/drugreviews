"I&#039;ve been on Pristiq for 8 weeks and believe me, I have never felt better in my life. It works, no side effects. I&#039;m a happy person now. The only thing I wouldn&#039;t do is to take Pristiq at night time. I take it at 8:00am, so I don&#039;t have sleeping problems. Try it this way. This medicine is wonderful. GOOD LUCK EVERYBODY."
