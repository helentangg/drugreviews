"My doctor prescribed this to me last June, started at 5mg, am now at 10mg per day.  This is one of the few medications I can take for depression due to throat swelling with most of the other ones.  I&#039;ve been taking Welbutrin for 10 years and with the Brintellix addition it works great. This is the best I&#039;ve felt in years."
