"My neurologist prescribed nortriptyline 2 years ago to help with my chronic migraines, which I&#039;d had since I was 13 years old. I&#039;d suffer migraines at least 4 times a week and the pain would be excruciating. I&#039;d suffer from rebound migraines as well and it turned out that I can&#039;t take medicines like Excedrin because they actually worsen my migraines. Imitrex stopped working. Once I started Nortriptyline, I started seeing relief within the first two months. I&#039;m on a steady 30mg and as long as I eat right, keep active and reduce stress [a big factor to how they&#039;d start at first], I only get level 8/9 migraines 2/3 a month, usually at the start and end of my menstrual cycle, and take Treximet for them."
