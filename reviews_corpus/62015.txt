"I have had a lifelong struggle with depression. I had a precious baby 4 months ago and began to struggle with Postpartum Depression. I thought if I lost the baby weight I&#039;d feel better. I got put on Phentermine which sent me into a downward spiral and the worst depression of my life! I went to the Dr 6 days after starting phentermine and he took me off of phen and put me on Celexa 10mg. Within 2-3 days, I felt so much better! My husband and I were arguing every other day before treatment and we haven&#039;t had a single disagreement since I started 3 weeks ago. We are both so happy with my results. My side effects have been not being able to sleep and I&#039;m always hungry. So far I haven&#039;t had weight gain but I&#039;ve really had to have self control."
