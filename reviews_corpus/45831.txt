"I started taking Prozac (10mg) a couple of months ago and I feel like a different person - in a good way. Before, I felt like I could not control my angry outburst. I no longer rage. I feel much more positive. I no longer obsessively think about people I am angry with. I feel capable of letting things go! I don&#039;t create hostility where there is none anymore. Prozac has been wonderful. I&#039;m really glad I started taking it."
