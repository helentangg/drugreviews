"I have been taking Paxil since 2001, when I was in college and age 21.  I have always been an anxious person.  My anxiety was probably partly biological or genetic and partly learned from my anxious parents.  In 2001 my anxiety became very bad.  For the first time in my life I was having panic attacks and became agoraphobic.  I was hardly eating.  I was also suicidal.  A doctor at my college put me on 60 mg of Paxil daily and 1 mg of Ativan three times a day.  I also began seeing a psychologist and a psychiatrist.  After about half a year I was able to decrease the Paxil to 50 mg per day and the Ativan to once a day.  The combination of Paxil and Ativan saved my life!  My anxiety decreased tremendously and I felt so much better!"
