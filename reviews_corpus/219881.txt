"I have been taking this medication for my migraines for about a year and a half. I take it at night and within 30 minutes I am asleep. This combined with verapamil 120mg ER has decreased my migraines from weekly to about one every 8 weeks or so. I have noticed I am calmer and more focused the next day. I have gained a little weight but I&#039;m not sure if that&#039;s age or the medicine. I&#039;m 46."
