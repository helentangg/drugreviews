"I was very skeptical about going on medication and I was really against it but after a big breakdown and not seeing the light, I took lexopro. I kept reading the reviews daily for hope as it took along time for the medication to kick in. Please give it 8 to 10 weeks! Now thoughts that would upset me just don&#039;t. It helps to lift the heavy fog and help you to live a normal life again. I still have anxiety at times but I am slowly increasing and it is helping. Thank you lexopro you really are a miracle. Dont give up guys!"
