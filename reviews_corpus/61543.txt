"Well, With citralopram being one for of the (in my opinion) Less commonly know drugs used to treat depression, I would say it does have some time to build up a reputable reputation in terms of it&#039;s reviews and significant statistics. I have used this drug for some time and i noticed a &#039;lift in mood&#039;. Which totally makes sense as mood is highly associated with depression, or at least managing depression, well that&#039;s the case with me. When i first went to the doctors, they did try me with a common drug named fluxeotine, (prozac)(20mg)daily. I found no change in my particular case of depression infact the severety of my issue worsened, so after a bit of a push with the doctor, they decided to try me on citalopram. Thumbs up."
