"I experienced 3 of the most common side effects of Pristiq. I experience nausea, loss of appetite and dizziness. The nausea and loss of appetite were minimal and I could get along with my day. However, the dizziness, in my opinion is not a side effect to be taken lightly. I was so dizzy, I could not concentrate or do well in class. I had to stop taking it because it was disrupting my school work very badly."
