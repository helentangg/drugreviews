"It&#039;s nice to see that so many people have had luck with this medication. It was horrible for me. I thought it would help me sleep after Trazadone stopped working, but instead I would be awake every other night, tossing and turning, with muscle spasms and hot flashes. I felt crazy. The doctor kept upping the dose thinking it would help, but of course it just got worse and I felt crazy. It was only a week, but I had to take off work and I just felt miserable. I couldn&#039;t eat and lost eight pounds. You won&#039;t know until you try it, but if you go a night without sleep, I would recommend not using it and not letting anyone talk you into trying more and more and more."
