"Only on day 4 of Pristiq, 50 mg, but definitely feel a difference. Yesterday was the first day I didn&#039;t feel like getting through the day was going to kill me. Had a miscarriage 3 1/2 weeks ago, but always had disthymia (clinical depression.) Tried everything you can imagine before. Celexa helped but stopped working a year ago. Also gained weight due to antidepressant. I&#039;ve lost a pound or so this week since starting Pristiq, and I don&#039;t feel so hopeless and sad since yesterday. I am smiling again, laughing again and making jokes. I&#039;m not feeling as happy as I know I can, but I&#039;ve only been using Pristiq for 4 days. I&#039;m looking forward to continued results. Side effects? If there are any I haven&#039;t noticed as I&#039;m still dealing with miscarriage."
