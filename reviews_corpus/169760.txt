"I have been suffering with migraines for about three years now. I got sent for a brain scan but the doctor then said I didn&#039;t need one. Got put back on amitriptyline but then weaned myself off it, the migraines had gone! Then in January this year I had an implant replaced. In June this year my migraines came back and I now take 30mg of Amitriptyline every night! I think personally its my implant that has triggered them? But amitriptyline only works for me when on a high dosage."
