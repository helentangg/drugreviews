"I have taken Silenor 4 times over the last 10 days as needed. I tried a little Doxepin twice before and pure Doxepin gave me a headache and hangover groggy effect. Silenor allows me to get 8 hours of sleep with NO side effects yay!  It&#039;s a great medicine....finally. If you have trouble sleeping then you should try it."
