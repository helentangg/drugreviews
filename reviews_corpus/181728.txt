"Prozac has helped my life greatly. I&#039;ve been taking it for years now and without taking it, I am a mess from worrying about whats going to happen the next day, to stressing about the future. I will worry about something over, and over, and over again obsessively, not being able to control it, no matter how bad I want to. Prozac clears my mind completely so that when I do think of a thought, it just goes away after that thought. No more over worrying or stressing in any such matter. Overall it made me a more happier person."
