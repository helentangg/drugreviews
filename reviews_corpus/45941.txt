"I am 31 years old and have been diagnosed with clinical depression, anxiety and have been severely anorexic on and off. I have been at a healthy body weight for many years. Over the course of 10 years I have taken various anti-depressants for my depression but they work for a certain period and then stop working.  I have just started taking Prozac and am on my second week.  I noticed instantly the first day, I felt warmer and more intuned to my body. I can think clearer and don&#039;t feel so irritable.  I have terrible neck pain that I have recently developed over the course of the week, so I hope it goes away over the next few weeks.  Otherwise I am quite excited to finally be taking a medicine that can help me, as well as so many others."
