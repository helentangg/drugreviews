"I am 35 yrs old male, and I have extreme anxiety (can&rsquo;t move out from the house) and panic attacks. Started 3 months ago, take only 15 mg/day: 
1st week: extreme nausea
from 2nd week: felt nothing, sometimes I had some light nausea, but nothing serious side effect.
from 4th week: definitely felt myself better, most of my anxiety and panic attacks are gone.
from 12th week: the drug shows his evil side. I don&rsquo;t know why, but I feel myself like a zombie. The extreme nausea is back, I always have headache, and my appetite is totally lost.
On the one hand this drug is great against anxiety, but on the other hand, has many many terrible side effects.
I guess, I&rsquo;ll quit, not worth it."
