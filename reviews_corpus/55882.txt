"I&#039;ve struggled with depression since I was a teenager (and attempted suicide then). In college I started having panic attacks. A few years later I was put on this new medicine called Effexor (after getting no relief from Paxil nor Zoloft) and for the first time in my life I felt relatively normal!  I&#039;ve been on Effexor - 150 mg/day for 20 years now and it has REALLY helped me to function at a high level.  I have gone off it several times - VERY slowly, but each time, a few months after being completely off, BANG - unbelievable depression, and I&#039;d go back on. I&#039;m at peace knowing I&#039;ll most likely be on it form the rest of my life.  Helps with depression AND anxiety.  No problems drinking while taking it, had three healthy kids while on it."
