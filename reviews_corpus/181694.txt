"I never had any problems with depression until I got hurt at work in 2009. Since then I&#039;ve lost 5 homes, 2 cars and have been completely stressed and severely depressed. Most days I didn&#039;t even get out of bed. I became very anti-social. I was prescribed Prozac and am only on day 5 and I can already feel a difference. I&#039;m up and out of bed. I have more energy then I&#039;ve had in months and I don&#039;t feel like everything is hopeless anymore. I&#039;m still having issues with irritability and severe mood swings, but hopefully my doctor can treat that with something else. Overall I couldn&#039;t be happier with this medication. So far so good, not even any side effects to speak of. It&#039;s great. "
