"I&#039;ve been on a 10mg dosage of Citalopram for about 2 weeks now and after a few days I could already see the effects. I have a lot more energy and hardly feel tired (I didn&#039;t even realise how tired and groggy I must have felt) I wake up and feel like getting out of bed would be nice! In terms of my anxiety, I usually felt panicked and my stomach and breathing would be really intensely effected but now when I am put in an anxious situation I don&#039;t feel panicked. I&#039;m really hoping that it stops my nausea which I get in the worst situations and I have faith that it will. Would highly recommend this drug to try out, I know it doesn&#039;t work for everyone but my boyfriend and his father are on it and have had amazing experiences. Give it a go!"
