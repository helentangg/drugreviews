"I have been on Pristiq for one week for major depression and treatment resistant depression.  I take this medicine at night and have had no side effects yet. I have experienced a major lift in my mood, I am laughing a lot more and in general feel pretty well.  It seems to work quickly and I hope added benefit comes with time, I am glad I decided to try it.  I was scared at 1st because SSRI&#039;s in general have always let me down, but this being a SSNRI - I think that is the name, I can see a light at the end of the tunnel now."
