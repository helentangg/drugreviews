"Tapered off generic citalopram 40mg after 12 years just didn&#039;t work anymore then tried Effexor after reading great reviews.  I took 75mg a day and into the 3rd week I had severe pounding migraines pressure behind my eyes nausea dizziness/brain zaps that were constant crying fits insomnia but vivid active dreams when I did sleep,  body chills,  leg twitches and severe terrible neck soreness. All these symptoms were happening at the same time and few times had hard pounding fast heart beats that I almost called 911. I think it may have been moderate serotonin toxicity. If you start this med start at the lowest possible dose.  It shocks your body.  Doc wants me to try Prozac but will talk to my psychiatrist first. 
Bad withdrawal symptoms too"
