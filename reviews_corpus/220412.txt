"I&#039;ve tried at least 10 different medications. I&#039;ve been on Lyrica for 4 months, now on Elavil of 10 mgs. I try to take it at 9pm, it helps me sleep. I go to bed at 1am but not all the time. And it helps me a lot with my chronic migraines however when I wake up at 10am, go back to bed an hour later, then wake up at 3:30pm."
