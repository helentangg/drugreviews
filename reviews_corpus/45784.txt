"I have been taking the generic drug flouxetine for 17 years now.  I was prescribed this to combat anxiety and panic attacks.  Although I was able to ward off the majority of the panic attacks using breathing methods, I still found myself unable to cope and that was when I was prescribed fluoxetine.  Results were mixed for the first two months.  I did not seem to feel any less anxiety until I was prescribed an additional medication called Klonopin.  This was to be taken as needed for anxiety attacks and it did the job.  The Klonopin actually seemed to get my chemistry under control to let the fluoxetine to work.  Then I only needed to use the Klonopin when the anxiety seems to try and come back.  Fluoxetine needed a bit of help for me."
