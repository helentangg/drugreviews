"I had debilitating migraines for a few months. Eyes were blurry 24/7, ice pick headaches, dizziness. Got an MRI to rule everything out. Diagnosed with chronic headaches. Neurologist put me on Nortriptyline. Started out with 10mg, each week added another 10mg till I was up to 40 mg. By the second week, my headache went way down. In a month it was completely gone. Tried to wean myself down, but headache returned.  I&#039;m staying on the 40 mg! I feel great now! This stuff works!!"
