"At first, Viibryd was God send. I was always happy, no sexual side effects, no fatigue: it worked absolutely great. I went through the trial pack and forgot to get a prescription. About 2 months go by (because I&#039;m lazy) and I finally go to the doctors to get another trial and a prescription. This time around of starting up, there&#039;s major side effects. The medication SOMEWHAT helps with my depression now, and I still get a strong sense of paranoia and hopelessness. The medication has STRONG sexual side effects now, and all arousal whatsoever is gone now. The insomnia is TERRIBLE. I get maybe 3 or 4 hours of sleep now. And might I mention I&#039;m on the low dosages; I haven&#039;t even started the 40mg yet."
