"I have been on Lexapeo for a few years. I LOVE IT! Without it, I get depressed and feel a constant sense of dread in the pit of my stomach, I have frequent panic attacks that feel like my heart is going to beat out of my chest,  and I my mood swings? LEGENDARY.  Lexapro saved me. I have been diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and panick attacks. Those should be enough, but I also had cancer and a miscarriage. So the depression, which has always been a thing, became a major problem. After finally having a child, the mood swing, another something that was always a thing, became horrific. No one could stand me.  I&#039;ve been on Lexapro since about 2010, and I have never felt better. I don&#039;t just exist.  I live now."
