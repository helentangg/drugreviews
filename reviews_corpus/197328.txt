"While this medicine may not be for everyone, it&#039;s helped me immensely. I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and depression. I was having intense mood swings where I&#039;d alternate between being so anxious I couldn&#039;t sleep for days and then so depressed I couldn&#039;t get myself out of bed in the morning. I felt like I didn&#039;t matter anymore and that I could stay in bed all day since no one would realize I wasn&#039;t there. I started out on 10mg of Paxil for 4 days before increasing to 20mg. After a few weeks the effects started to wear off and I fell into a deep depression, so my dosage increased to 30mg a day. I take it before bed, and all my insomnia problems have gone away. It&#039;s done wonders for me. I have my life back."
