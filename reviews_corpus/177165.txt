"This drug is ruining my life. I&#039;m 58 years old and have been tormented by side affects and horrible thoughts. Don&#039;t care about anything. If I stop can&#039;t handle it. I have tried to get off for last couple of years and has caused my health to decline. I&#039;m 94 pounds now and I just feel like a zombie. Can&#039;t even think. Sit for hours on end and can&#039;t move. Don&#039;t take this drug. It will ruin your life and change you to someone who doesn&#039;t care about anything. Don&#039;t take this drug."
