"I had an operation 8 weeks ago which has upset my sleeping. I was given zopiclone for 2 weeks which did make me sleep but no more than 4 hrs per night. Since last Friday I am on 50mg of amitriptyline and the first night I slept but felt like a zombie the next morning - couldn&#039;t feel my shins or feet and very spaced out. This morning, 6 days since I started amitriptyline, I haven&#039;t slept and when I say that I mean that - not a wink of sleep in the last 3 night&#039;s. I was passing out yesterday with exhaustion. They have reduced my dose to 35 and I will persist but at this present time it hasn&#039;t helped me at all, just made me worse. I am hoping it will come good because the reviews are inspiring."
