"Only took one dose.  Achy the next morning. 22 hrs after dose dizziness and weakness.  My husband could barely get a BP on me and when my pulse came up enough to register it was only 54.  I vomited then sweat profusely. My knees hurt severely for an hour.  Hot flashes were diminished for the next 3 days.  Fine now but still having hot flashes."
