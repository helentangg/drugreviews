"I have been on 100mg of Zoloft (Sertraline) for about 3 weeks and have already lost 6 pounds. I can stay still. I get so much accomplished though, more focused, able to multi-task and my depression/anxiety is gone. I feel like my old self again. I also feel way more creative than I ever have been. I do have to take a sleep aid otherwise I will be up all night."
