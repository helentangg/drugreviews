"I have been taking venlafaxine for about a year now. It has helped greatly with my anxiety. I take 37.5MG twice a day. I weaned myself off of it after taking it for the first 3 months because I was losing my medical benefits and wasn&#039;t able to afford the cost of it. The side effects were bad, extreme dizziness and nausea. I have had a lack of libido also which definitely puts a damper on the love life. I&#039;ve also gained about 30 pounds but I&#039;m actually happy about that side effect since I&#039;ve been a 5&#039;10 twig most of my life."
