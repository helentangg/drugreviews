"What&#039;s dangerous about reading reviews online is that people are much more inclined to go online and scream about an medicine when it doesn&#039;t work for them while those who it works for blissfully embrace its effects and don&#039;t feel the need to go online and write a glowing review. For the past 8 months I&#039;ve increasingly found myself experiencing the latter and I have to say that Viibryd has changed my life. I had tried numerous other SSRI&#039;s that all left me feeling like a zombie. I had wanted to go on one that had less chance of sexual side effects so before this I tried Luvox was awful. Viibryd has nearly eliminated my social and general anxiety with positive sexual side effects. I highly recommend it to anyone."
