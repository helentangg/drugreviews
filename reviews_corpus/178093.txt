"I started Cymbalta 30 mg last night for the first time. The medicine made me very sleepy and I fell asleep. I awoke during the night with very sharp pains in my head, the left side of my face felt numb, a lot of sweating, very unusual racing thoughts (I was a business woman with a briefcase walking the streets in New York) ...(possible hallucination, not sure) heart palpitations and my head felt like it weighed a ton. It is now the next day and I feel very weak and dizzy and lightheaded. I&#039;m nauseated and still having headaches. Wished it could have worked but I can&#039;t take it anymore."
