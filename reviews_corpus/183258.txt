"I&#039;m a 21 year old female and have suffered with depression and horrible thoughts for as long as I can remember. I was started on one medicine, (can&#039;t remember what it was), then Zoloft, which did not work, and was recently put on Cymbalta about three weeks ago. My depression had gotten so bad that I was willing to try everything. I was having emotional breakdowns at work, having horrible thoughts, bad dreams, and was withdrawn from everything. My depression is a brain imbalance, rather than caused by other things. Only being about two weeks on Cymbalta, I can already notice a difference. I&#039;m more peppy, I don&#039;t think bad thoughts nearly as much, much more patience, haven&#039;t cried since I&#039;ve been put on the medicine. I was a little jittery at first."
