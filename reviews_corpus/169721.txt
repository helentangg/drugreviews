"I love my doctor for the introduction to ELAVIL. No more pounding headaches, vomiting, no more feelings of put me out of my misery! I had stopped taking my wonder pill after the first week, why?  NO headaches but yes I am gaining weight and feel as if I need a snack right after dinner. I am learning work out is a must as I am trying to get there. I just need the desire to do it."
