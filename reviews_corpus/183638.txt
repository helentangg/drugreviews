"This medicine worked while I was taking it, but when my doctor stopped my use... the withdrawals were AWFUL!  Be VERY careful!  It was the worst thing I had ever been through in my life!  He took me slowly off the medicine, but that did not matter... I&#039;ve heard others with the same repsonse as myself."
