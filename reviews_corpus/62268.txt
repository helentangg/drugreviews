"I have been on this medication for 3 days and what a difference it has made.  I am on 10mg and I have tried 3 other antidepressants and they made me feel like a zombie and could not function. What a great antidepressant, I have more energy, everything seems normal.  I feel like my old self- 15 years ago."
