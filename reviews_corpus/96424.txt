"I have been on (Zoloft) for 6 weeks now and have noticed a big difference in my mood and panicking. I have only had 3 panic attacks since I have been on it! Which is a good thing for me because before I started it I was having panic attacks all day everyday. I have only had night sweats other than that nothing major! I started out on 25mg just like everyone else and after 1 month they increased it to 50mg and I think that 50mg has helped me a lot. No more panic and no depression. Life is getting a lot better thanks to the Zoloft I would highly recommend it. Good luck to all."
