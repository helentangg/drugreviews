"I feel like I have tried every medication on the market for my depression and terrible anxiety. When a racing heart prompted me to visit my local emergency room, the Dr prescribed 20mg for &quot;stress&quot; (aka depression). This medication has changed my life. I feel like a generally content person when I take this. I stopped for a while as I went traveling and had forgotten to refill my prescription. When I got back, I figured I had survived a week without it I would just stay off of it. That was a mistake. Went back to the Dr and got back on it. Now, I&#039;m feeling amazing. Please please please don&#039;t give up and try this medication!"
