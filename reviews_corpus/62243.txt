"I am a 20 year old female who has suffered from depression for 5 years. I have tried many different medications and have had little to no luck with anything, until my doctor prescribed me Citalopram. I feel great. I feel tired alot more often, but that&#039;s the only side effect I have noticed. I&#039;d recommend this medication to anyone who feels their current depression medication isn&#039;t working. Hope I&#039;ve helped."
