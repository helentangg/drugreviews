"I started Trintellix/Brintellix 9 months ago and it worked good for depression except I was recalling memories from the past which were disturbing, and I seemed more sensitive to negative issues in the world.   This felt odd and disturbing but I stayed on it.  I had no weight gain but in the beginning I had severe esophagus pain and ear pain which came and went for months... Oh ya, I also threw up the first few weeks. This drug made me hyper for months and then a month ago , I crashed and went into a depression.. Well, I think it&#039;s time to go back on cymbalta.  I gave Trintellix/Brintellix a good try.  Strange drug.  Hope the withdrawal isn&#039;t too severe."
