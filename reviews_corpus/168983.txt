"The 10mg didn&#039;t seem to help at all so after few days they let me up it to 20mg. I had a little trouble sleeping my legs would twitch and it made me feel really angry for few hours. I took Tylenol PM for a couple of days after upping it and it seemed to calm me down so I could sleep.  Then I was fine until it was time to up it to the 40mg.  I could not sleep at all, my whole body would twitch and I just felt out of it and like I was going to have a panic attack.  Finally took a bath and it helped me relax enough to sleep for couple hours. It was very scary but after a couple of hours I felt fine. I am a little scared to take the second dose of the 40mg but I think I&#039;m gonna try taking it in the morning.  I feel great on the medicine. other wise.."
