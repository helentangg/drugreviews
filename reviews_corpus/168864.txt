"Got up to 40 grams of Viibryd, and finally started to feel good!  (Been on many anti-depressants over the past 35 years).  Last week I had the worst, scariest breakdown, almost uncontrollable anger, sobbing, insomnia and extreme fatigue, body aches and my nerve pain was off the chart.  Today my doctor reduced Viibryd to 20, hoping that will stabilize me, along with my Buspar and Xanax. Now let&#039;s see what this week brings.  Oh, I also have Multiple Sclerosis, diabetes, heart issues &amp; arthritis."
