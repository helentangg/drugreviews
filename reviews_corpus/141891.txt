"This is just my experiences and opinions. This medication has not helped me much for my anxiety or OCD. I am taking 10 mg once a day,  but now I don&#039;t know if maybe I need to increase my dose or change to something else.  The main problem I am having is that it has not seemed to help me much with my hand washing OCD and now I have become itchy from dry skin and scalp."
