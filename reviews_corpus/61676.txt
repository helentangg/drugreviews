"I have dosed at 20mg and 10mg and I&#039;ve found that 10mg works best for me. I started taking cit after getting divorced to deal with anxiety (I have PTSD and my ex exacerbated this with stalking). If I take it on an empty stomach it can give me nausea but a banana or something simple fixes this. It will give me a mild headache about an hour after taking but that doesn&#039;t last long. I do not take any other meds or herbs. I am a white female over 50. On 20 mg I felt so &quot;relaxed&quot; I tended to spend money I shouldn&#039;t. I dosed down to keep that in check. It helps me manage single parenting stress and reduces angry reactions in stressful situations. Other than the light headaches and mild temporary nausea, no other side effects."
