"I was being prescribed different anxiety/depression drugs when Effexor stopped working. It was hell for months. Then I had the genetic blood test and found that there were only a few drugs that could work with my body. I was prescribed Pristiq 3 years ago and so far it has worked. initially, the side effects are strong, but they lessen as time goes on. Currently, I may have dizziness and flushing, but the good effects of this drug greatly outweigh the bad. I am taking 150 mg (1) 50 mg and (1) 100 mg and found out it is $60 less per prescription if I take (3) 50 mg pills instead. This is not an inexpensive drug, but it works for me."
