"Before lexapro I spent the majority of my time sleeping in bed and hiding away from people, plus I felt really depressed.  It&#039;s really good for anxiety.  I rarely worry anymore.   I only focus on solutions and try not to worry about the things I can&#039;t control, and lexapro has helped me feel more emotionally balanced."
