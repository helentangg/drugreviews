"I suffered from depression on and off til I was 33. My doctor prescribed a couple medicines without success. Tried Tofranil because my mother took it in the late 1950&#039;s. Noticed a gradual improvement over 1 to 4 months with the full effect over a period of about 12 months. Medicine did not work at 100mg so went up to 250mg then 200mg. Some (small price) side effects include dry mouth (Gum, tictac remedy) medicine makes you sleepy about 2 hrs after ingestion. Get ready for a good nights sleep, increased appetite and feeling more relaxed than ever before. I remember the first sign of the Tofranil working was when I went outside one day and the sun seemed so bright and I was happier to be alive. That was 25years ago. "
