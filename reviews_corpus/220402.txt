"I have been on Endep for Fibromyalgia for 10 years.  At first the affect was awesome, for the first time in many years I slept properly and had hardly any pain.  Over the years though, this has changed.  I started off on 50mg per day and over the years had to have it increased to the maximum does of 150mg.  Recently I have been having heart palpatations and an increased heart rate.  My doctor has put it down to the extended time I have been on Endep at such a high rate. So now I am on a drug to lower my heart rate, which works well, but my doctor is getting me to try to cut down on the Endep with a view of going off it altogether and hopefully also going off the drug that I need to lower my heart rate.  It&#039;s not working I&#039;m in too much pain"
