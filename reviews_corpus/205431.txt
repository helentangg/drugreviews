"I have been on Pristiq now for about 15 months. I started on 50mg, which only worked for part of the day, I had to be bumped up to 100mg. I can&#039;t remember any immediate side effects, apart from maybe a little headache and dilated pupils due to a sudden burst of energy. They give you a burst of adrenaline. Now the medication has well and truly settled into my system, my body and mind now rely on it for me to actually function. If I miss a morning pill, by mid afternoon I am grouchy, prone to mood swings, tired and sleepy. If I miss two days, I am severely tired, sad, prone to rage and severe swings of depression. I have severe photosensitivity if I miss a pill. I have tripled the freckles on my body, my eyes cannot deal with bright lights."
