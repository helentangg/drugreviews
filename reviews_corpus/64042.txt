"Have been on 50mg a day for over 3 months now.
At first I noticed nothing, and then had some bad side effects which made me want to come off them (weaned off pregablin before going on this - which was the most horrific medicine!). 
My doctor told me to persevere and my anxiety had been so bad I decided to carry on taking the Sertraline. Now over 3 months on this drug has changed my life. It hasn&#039;t changed me as a person, the only way I act differently is that I feel content, happy and hopeful - something I haven&#039;t felt in so many years. Yes there is the anxiety demon still there as I&#039;m still the same, but I am able to control it now."
