"I&#039;ve dealt with IBS for years. Recently diagnosed  approx 7 months ago. It was debilitating, every morning waking up with a stomach ache. Always misdiagnosed and given other antidepressants. Finally after seeing a Gastroenterologist, my lifesaver prescribed me Nortriptyline at a low dose of 10mg at night I woke up 2 days later pain free! I gave him a huge hug! I&#039;m now on 20 mg. only downside is sleeping issues. But hey, I can deal with that!"
