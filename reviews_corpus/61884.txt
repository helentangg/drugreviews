"In 2011 started on 20mg for being easily agitated and had side effects like insomnia, waking up drenched in sweat, yawning and being dizzy. Took it at night.  It took months for the side effect to go away.  It worked great and after 2 years I dropped to 10mg for a just over a year and stopped with my docs help.  No real issues with withdrawal.  Just a little dizzy.

4 months later my wife mention me being agitated again.  I started 20mg again, LOTS of issues.  Bad insomnia, drenched in sweat, shaking really bad, yawning, racing thoughts (wanting to hurt others or myself), paranoia, going crazy, racing heart, rashes, burning  arms..  The thoughts scared the hell out of me. At 13 days, doc said stop NOW.  Mostly back to normal after 2-3 weeks"
