"I went to my obgyn after experiencing a very emotional year with family and work then started hot flashes!!  Thankfully, my obgyn was wonderful and didn&#039;t think I was crazy!  She prescribed 75 mg Effexor -generic venlafaxine -much cheaper too.  I saw improvement in hot flashes and mood within 2 days.  I am on week 2 and feel more like my old self, minor hot flash symptoms, lost 4 pounds and I don&#039;t feel the need to eat everything in sight!  First week I did experience sleepiness and yawning but that has gone away and I am alert and feeling good!"
