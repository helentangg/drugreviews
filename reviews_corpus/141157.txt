"I have panic attacks and anxiety. My doc prescribed 10 mg of teva-escitalopram. I tried taking this medication about a month ago and was soo sick by day 2 I quit. I just had a bad panic attack on the weekend so I decided to start taking this medication again, this time I broke the pill in half. I&#039;m now on day 4. My anxiety seems a bit worse because now I&#039;m scared. I&#039;m dizzy, I have diarrhea, I get bad head aches, I&#039;m freezing right now and I just threw up a little bit. Is this normal? Every one says the first week is hellish.....like this? Thanks!"
