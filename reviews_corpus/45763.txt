"I started taking fluoxetine for anxiety (never told the MD about my bulimia) and was relieved when my bulimia was alleviated as well.  I stopped taking the medicine last week because I think it makes me a little TOO happy, kind of high-acting all the time, even though I am only on a 20 mg/day dose.  My husband does not like the change in personality I have had while on it.  He doesn&#039;t know about my disorder.  While on the medicine my bulimia was greatly reduced, but I did binge and purge still on occasion.  Felt a greater sense of self control though.  Since quitting the medicine about a week ago, I have been out of control, binging and purging twice a day on average.  I think I need to start taking it again, placebo effect or not."
