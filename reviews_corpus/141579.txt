"I took Lexapro for 14 months, on 10mg for 12 and then 5mg for two. The month after I came off it was hell; anxiety returned. I was prescribed it after a severe panic attack where I became severely overwhelmed by life effects and I wasn&#039;t responding to talk therapy so it was felt by my doctors that the depression was more clinical and needed a chemical to lift me out of it. Lexapro brought to the fore my issues with alcohol as it mixes really badly with alcohol so it made me finally curb my drinking. Lexapro made me forgetful and unable to remember the word I was looking for mid-sentence or sometimes I&#039;d say weird things which had never happened before. Overall it helped me make the positive changes I needed to get better so it did work."
