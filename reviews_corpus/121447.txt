"I tried Effexor about eight ago, for a few weeks. Terrible medication! Racing thoughts, my anxiety level went skyrocketing.  Soon when I started using the drug, I started to emerge strong and badly violent obsessive thoughts, albeit I am usually very kind, easy going and non violent person. No, I did not implement these thoughts, thank goodness,  because I understood theme as obsessive thoughts, which were caused by the drug. I had no appetite and had to force my self to eat or drink.  It was really scary. It took weeks to recovery. I was suggested to try it again last year, I said absolutely no! Never!"
