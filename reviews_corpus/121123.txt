"Been on Effexor for fourteen years. It makes Ocd worse and PTSD worse and my depression worse. I don&#039;t care what these negative reviews say, I am switching from this crap drug to another antidepressant. I feel fourteen years of my life have been ruined and I was lied to by the medical profession, they never told me how terrible this drug was and how it makes paranoia and OCD and PTSD worse. Oh and I can&#039;t eat oats or wheat or cheese or margarine or butter as it gives me drowsiness and unbeatable tiredness.Effexor should be banned, its ruined my life and I can&#039;t wait to come off it and go on another drug."
