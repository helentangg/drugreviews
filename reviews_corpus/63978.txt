"I give Zoloft (sertraline) a 10/10 for my OCD, as well as for my Panic Disorder and Generalized Anxiety. I have struggled with these disorders since I was a little kid. Other anti-depressants helped but only a little. Before Zoloft, I was having multiple disabling panic attacks per day, severe anxiety especially at bedtime, and severe OCD including intrusive thoughts and checking behaviors. I have been on 50 mg for 3 months, and it has made a big difference in my symptoms for all of my disorders. My overall anxiety has lessened, my OCD has improved (less checking and fewer intrusive thoughts) and I can now go a week or more without a panic attack. I just moved up to 75 mg to help with remaining anxiety/OCD/panic."
