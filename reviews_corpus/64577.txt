"I took Sertraline for about a month. I know that typically it takes longer for SSRIs and other psychiatric medication to truly begin working, but the adverse effects I experienced from this drug were way too much to handle. For one, I couldn&#039;t sleep at all...like I mean at all. I lost so much weight from my lack of appetite that I actually ended up having to go to the hospital. Not to mention, my anxiety/panic attacks were so severe I almost got admitted to an inpatient facility. My only advice would be watch out for any sign of severe weight loss. I had pretty horrible experiences on this drug...I wish you all the best of luck."
