"I replaced my Zoloft for depression for Cymbalta to treat fibromyalgia and depression on the advice of my pain specialist. It has been a God send for the fibromyalgia, I feel so much better in that respect. Still have minor bouts occasionally but much improved. Wasn&#039;t sure it worked better than the Zoloft for depression so asked him if we could increase it from 60mg to 90mg. He wasn&#039;t comfortable with that. I threw the idea past my new psychiatrist (I have bipolar) and he said the 60mg is an adequate dose. So. I guess all in all I&#039;m pretty pleased with the results I am having. I have been on Cymbalta for several months. It started working quickly and I have not suffered any ill-effects. I wish it could work this well for everyone."
