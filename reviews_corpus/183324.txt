"I love it. I&#039;m in a clinical research study for Fibromyalgia in minors and after about four months of getting what I think was the placebo, I&#039;ve received the actual medicine. It&#039;s worked. I know it has. I&#039;ve been taking it for about four weeks now, and in that time, I&#039;ve had two or three flare-ups, and minimum amount of migraines.

I&#039;m about to play and run around with my 15 month old nephew. And I can hold him and put him down, then pick him back up and it doesn&#039;t bother me all too much. I can&#039;t even remember the last time I&#039;ve had to take bed rest because of doing too much.

Overall, it took about 3-4 days to kick in. I&#039;m constantly hot and sweating, but that&#039;s nothing compared to always being in pain."
