"Been on Paxil since 2012. All in all there has been good and bad like any medication.  Some side effects people complain about like tiredness and appetite increase for me have been to my advantage. Anxiety robbed me of my  appetite and sleep. It has helped me with my social anxiety in ways other media didn&#039;t. It actually made me want to be more sociable and made me finally see how small my fears were which I made out to be so unreal. Anyways now I don&#039;t fear public places or people anymore I feel normal as I would call It!"
