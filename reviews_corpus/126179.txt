"My Doc gave me a titration pack of Viibryd and after the second week, at 20mg, I feel pretty good. I continue with the third and fourth week packs, going from 20 to 40 mgs, and begin to get side effects:
I get spaced out, lose my train of thought, my short-term memory goes out the window, etc etc. 
So I reduce the dose back to 20mg and I am pretty good, still some space and memory issues, but not serious, and my mood is stable. And my libido is back!!
But: I have been eating like crazy, ice cream, cheese, bread, eating, eating, eating. Mostly ice cream, like it&#039;s the greatest thing in the world. I have an appetite that won&#039;t go away! I&#039;ve had a stable weight for decades and gained 12 lbs in the last month or so (6&#039;@196) and counting."
