"Like others, I&#039;d been on Paxil and Lexapro before.  Lexapro helped for a few months only.  I&#039;ve been on Effexor XR for a month now and what a difference.  I have more energy and I&#039;m thinking more clearly.  Thank God for this medicine. I have an active 5 year old who now has her mommy back."
