"Depression gone and fibromyalgia reduced by 65 percent.  I do have much intestinal distress which I attribute to the side effects.  I&#039;m on 60mg.  Started 8 months ago.  Same time distress began.  I&#039;m thnking of asking for a lower dose to see if that helps.  If I miss a dose I have horrible nightmares and night sweats. I don&#039;t want to give it up since it helps so many of my problems."
