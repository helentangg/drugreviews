"To deal with menopausal symptoms: stress, anxiety, depression and insomnia, I tried paxil and prozac. Not a good result: both very heavy duty - you FEEL drugged. With prozac I was drooling and I didn&#039;t even know it; with paxil,  I felt dull-witted and thick, like a beached whale. 
But the  3rd time was a charm: I tried Celexa and it worked almost immediately. I felt calmer, not depressed and I slept like a baby. For me it&#039;s the best. the only side effect is one 1/2 hour after taking it I feel nauseous for a few minutes. small price to pay."
