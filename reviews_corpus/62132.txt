"35 yo female, wife, three kids - 11 yo son and 4 yo twin girls. I went through therapy which helped A LOT but I was still struggling. I was very impatient, easily agitated, would lash out at my family. I was basically driving everyone away from me. My doc suggested citalopram and I hesitated at first, then decided to take it. I noticed a difference from day one. My twins definitely put the meds to the test, but I was able to deal with them as a patient, rational adult. Side effects - sleepy a lot, sweaty a lot, occasional upset stomach. My husband has noticed how much better I am too. I REALLY hope the sleepy, sweaty beast goes away, but other than that I truly am happy, functional, fun to be around again. Thank goodness!"
