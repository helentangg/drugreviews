"I&#039;ve been taking Trintellix for over 6 months now and it&#039;s helped me a lot! Taking it along with my anxiety medication and birth control has completely gotten rid of my suicidal thoughts and now my panic attack are extremely rare, and only when I am about to/am on my period. My only problem is that it hasn&#039;t done as well as psychiatrist has hoped, I still have some of the daze and haziness that prevents me from being able to do anything. Which isn&#039;t a very great point if you&#039;re on 20mg and your insurance will barely pay for it since it&#039;s new, leaving you with about 340$!!!! I still think it&#039;s done well by getting me stable and calm but still not really good enough for me, at least right now."
