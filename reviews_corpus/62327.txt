"Citalopram saved my life. I had been having a hard time, new mortgage, parents new divorce and a death in the family. I&#039;ve never had panic attacks and anxiety before but I went through 7 months of hell before I decided to get see a doctor who gave me Lorazopam ( if your having panic attacks. Lorazopam is another miracle I have encountered ). Although I could deal with my panic attacks my anxiety was out of control. I couldn&#039;t even go into work without that lingering feeling of panic. My poor boyfriend was having the hardest time as I didn&#039;t want to leave the house. Then I started on citalopram, this medicine has changed me back to the person I was before. I was so afraid I would never be &quot;Normal&quot; again. But here I am, Very Happy."
