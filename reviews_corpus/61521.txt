"I am on this medication for generalized anxiety and panic disorder. Even though it says it is an antidepressant, I have used this with great success in reducing my daily anxiety. I am currently on a 30mg dose and it seems to have levelled me out pretty well. The only side effect I would complain about is the insomnia BUT it gets better after about 6 weeks. I went many nights being able to fall asleep only to wake up a few hours later and be wide awake unable to return to sleep. I began using melatonin at night, and after about 6 weeks I have had a much easier time with sleep. I can make you a bit lethargic during the day, but nothing I am unable to handle. With minor side effects and help with the anxiety, I highly recommend."
