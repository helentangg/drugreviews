"This medicine has changed my life:  I go out again, I am smiling again. I was so worried about weight gain as I have battled eating disorders all my life and I have not gained any weight on 5mg, but my whole life has changed. I am &quot;me&quot; again. The only side effect I have is vivid dreams, and I had headaches for the first week. I am on the brand name CIPRALEX and it has worked wonders for me. Much of my problems are hormone related (PMDD and PCOS) But I exercise, watch what I eat, and mostly I smile. I was worried to start this medicine because of the weight-related reviews but I am doing well on it, and I am a better mom and wife. I am also remembering to love myself which I hadn&#039;t done in years."
