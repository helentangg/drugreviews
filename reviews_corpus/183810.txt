"Yes, there are side effects, as with all medications.  However, the benefits of taking Cymbalta outweigh the negative side-effects by far.  This drug has been a life-saver for me.  It is the best anti-depressant I have been on.  I would rather sweat a little more and sleep a little less, than suffer from the debilitating effects of depression."
