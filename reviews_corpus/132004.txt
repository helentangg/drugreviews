"So far Effexor XR has been a lifesaver with minimal side effects. As a full time care giver to my mom who has Alzheimer&#039;s, depression was slowly destroying me and I was a fool to think I was man enough to deal with it - with no help. After 3 weeks use, I had completely overcome my heavy alcohol use and my motivation, clarity and concentration levels returned to an above normal level. In the beginning I did experience the sweating side effect and felt a bit anxious. My doctor agreed he should have started me at the lowest dose instead of the 75mg. I now find that a 75mg dose every other day, supplemented with exercise on the non dose days has seriously turned my life around for the better."
