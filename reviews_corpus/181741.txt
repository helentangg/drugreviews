"Prozac has changed my life.  I had postpartum depression after having a baby &amp; went for months thinking I could fix everything on my own but nothing alleviated the unrealistic hopelessness.  My midwife said that one antidepressant doesn&#039;t work for everyone, it is like putting your hand in a mixed candy jar and pulling one out, the effects are that unpredictable.  Prozac has been amazing for me.  It has taken the OCD, hopelessness edge off so now I feel like I have a choice about how I feel. Side effects included feeling nauseous and having diarrhea on the first day, my husband says I sometimes tremor at night, it doesn&#039;t work as well when I am on my period, and I often feel really low after having sex.  Overall, Prozac has saved my sanity."
