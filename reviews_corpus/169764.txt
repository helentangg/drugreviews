"I have fibromyalgia, SLE, migraines and nerve pain and was started on Amitriptyline 10mg in January of 2008, was increased to 20mg that fall, and have been increased to 30 mg for the last 4 months. I found it helpful, it decreased all my symptoms, but increases were needed as the effectiveness wore off in time. My physician informed me that he would not increase the dosage past 30 mg as anything over 30mg was only effective in treating the antidepressant symptoms, not nerve related symptoms. He added Gabapentin 1 month ago, but I felt no change. He would now like me to stop both of these meds, and try Lyrica. I would like to add that I too have gained 50 lbs, and crave sweets always."
