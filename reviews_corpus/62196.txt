"I started taking Celexa just over 2 years ago after my 3rd husband and I broke up.  I was really depressed. DR. gave me 10 mg of Celexa. I felt like a new person within 24 hours.  It has changed my life.  For the first time I truly feel balanced.  I tried to stop Celexa after about a year later.  After about a month I started feeling a low level depression, weepy and negative.  I went back on my 10 mg. and am up and running again. I can look back on my relationships and see how my depression really contributed to the breakups."
