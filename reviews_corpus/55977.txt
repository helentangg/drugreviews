"I&#039;ve taken Effexor for 7 years, in a dosage that has decreased from 225mg to 75 mg over the last 2 years.  While I had some benefit with depression I experienced side effects from Effexor. I experienced short term memory loss, problems concentrating, blurry vision, weight gain, sweating, and dry mouth.  I cannot drink at all on the medication, since it exacerbates the memory and mental focus problems enormously, even at one glass of wine."
