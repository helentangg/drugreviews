"Cymbalta was the worst possible medicine I have ever been on.  Not only did it not help my depression at all, it actually made it worse.  I also started taking it for Fibromyalgia pain which it did not help.  Indeed, I have had more pain since starting on the Cymbalta than before I was on it. I can&#039;t even count how many times I have considered putting myself in the mental health ward of the local hospital. "
