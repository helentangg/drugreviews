"I am taking Zoloft 50 mg since more than 10 years, to deal with depression. My only problem is that I get SLEEP FULL OF DREAMS ONLY. My Doctors have tried a lot by giving many different sleeping medications, but all in vain.

I have come across a couple of patients with the same problem.

In case any of you have faced the same problem, please share your experience. If you have been able to solve this problem (of sleep full of dreams), please let me know how.
Thanks."
