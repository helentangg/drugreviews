"I finally was brave enough to start this medication for bad anxiety, panic attacks.  I have become limited on where I go.  Finally so exhausted from pushing myself  just to go to the grocery store......I gave in and took 10mg Saturday night.  Took just half of a .25 mg xanax with it.  Just in case of side effects.  Surprisingly nothing bad has happened yet.  I know it will take time for then to take effect.  And hoping they will soon help. Tonight will be my 4th pill.  I will keep you posted. Wish me luck
