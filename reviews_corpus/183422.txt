"I really wish I could have tolerated this medication.  Especially, from some of the comments on this site.  However, I also suffered from heart palpitations, fast heart beat, anxiety, and an overall yucky feeling.  After a couple of days of taking the medication - I knew it wasn&#039;t for me.  I have never been able to tolerate a norepinephrine and serotonin combination (SNRI&#039;s).  I am researching to see if there is a SSRI that works well for Fibromyalgia. I am very happy for the people it has helped.  This was just my experience."
