"I have dealt with both anxiety and depression the majority of my adult career. I was previously on Prozac 10mg, and had a dosage increase to 20mg but I experienced no significant change and could not stay consistent with the medication. After discontinuing the Prozac, I felt I could deal with my Anxiety without medication. Boy was I wrong.. symptoms got worse..
-uncontrollable crying
-dry heaving 
- no interest in doing anything 
-tired all of the time

I finally got evaluated by my provider, and they prescribed Lexapro 10mg

This is only my second day on the medication, and anxiety is at a low. However, I am feeling very Nauseous 

I normally have a beer or two, and I have no interest in drinking alcohol 

Is this normal?"
