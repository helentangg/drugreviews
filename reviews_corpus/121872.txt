"I have been on this medication for 12 mths now. The only side effect is being extremely tired. However this is much better than the depression I was experiencing. I&#039;ve always had moments however after having a traumatic child birth, and various other family issues it quickly increased. It has basically saved my marriage and allows me to now enjoy the time with my beautiful children. 
I have struggled to lose weight (still from my second child), however I am also using the Mirena which seems to have negative reviews in this area. So I&#039;m looking to remove it.
I&#039;m glad I have read the other posts, as I&#039;m more confident that the removal of the Mirena will allow me to lose the few kilo&#039;s that I have, as I need to stay on the Effexor a little longer."
