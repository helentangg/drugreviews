"I&#039;m back on Pristiq after having tried several other medications due to sexual side effects.  I had taken Prozac for 20 years and had tried countless other medicines.  Prozac stopped working and none of the others made me feel normal like Pristiq.  My doctor recommended that I take my Pristiq every other day or not to take it on days when I want to have sex.  Now I can ejaculate again and have a great sex life.  Thanks Pristiq.  It feels so good to be normal again."
