"I&#039;ve taken Zoloft. Made me feel spacy and disconnected. Took Celexa and it pooped out on me and made me extremely drowsy and fatigued no matter what time of day I took it. Added Wellbutrin to combat the energy and motivational issues. Turned me into a bipolar irritable basket case. Stopped taking Wellbutrin after 3 weeks and titrating off the Celexa and starting Viibryd. It may be expensive. On day 2 the sexual dysfunction I experienced with all 3 other medicines had disappeared. Dare I say it my libido was through the roof. Borderline nymphomaniac. And I have yet to feel the drowsiness that people are speaking of. Granted it&#039;s now day 4 and I&#039;m already taking it at night."
