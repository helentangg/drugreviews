"Lexapro (or the Escitalopram version in my country) was almost immediately successful in treating my anxiety and extreme rage issues. I&#039;ve been using it for 8 months, but experience one major side-effect: constant tiredness or lethargy. I&#039;ve tried taking it at other times during the day, but no change. I sleep really well at night, have vivid dreams, am more creative and able to solve problems - if I can stay awake during the day. Get really drowsy two hours after taking this and can easily nap for a couple of hours in the afternoon.  I&#039;m no longer a bitch, but also no longer awake. So will have to choose between being mentally sharp or being anxious and angry all the time."
