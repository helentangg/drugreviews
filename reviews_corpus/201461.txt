"I&#039;ve been on Zoloft for a week now. The first 5 days the side effects were horrible. Dizziness, stomach problems, sweating, weak muscles. Then on the sixth day, I remember the change. All day at school I was still experiencing the side effects and then I was in the car with my mom and I just felt a lot happier. From then on, I&#039;ve felt SO HAPPY! When I talk to people, my mind is clearer and it&#039;s easier to socialize! I&#039;ve been socially anxious my whole life, I LOVE ZOLOFT SO MUCH OMG THIS IS GONNA CHANGE MY LIFE! It&#039;s also boosting my confidence. :))))))"
