"I have been on Zoloft for about two months for disthymia (constant mild depression), however I had about a 2 week gap where I wasn&#039;t taking it.  I was prescribed 50 mg, but since my side effects were pretty heavy at first, I decided to only take 25 mg for a while to start off.  I wasn&#039;t aware that 50 mg is the threshold of therapeutic effectiveness, so by taking 25 mg at a time I may have just been wasting it.  However, after taking it for the first month, I thought I noticed myself smiling and laughing more (a rare thing for me).  I am back on 50 mg, and I really hope that it helps me to feel happiness and excitement again in appropriate situations, where usually I will barely raise an eyebrow."
