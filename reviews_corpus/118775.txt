"After 1 week of loose bowels and strange stomach noises/sensations, week 2 came and the jaw clenching/teeth grinding sensation in my temples started. Along with throat pain and suicidal thoughts, it was tough to stick it out and stay on but I did. I started on 25mg then up to 50mg then on to 75mg by week 3. Things got better around then. I still felt anxious, but the medicine was blocking my physical response that my body would produce from stress and anxiety. I would get chest pains, stomach pains, head pains all the time, got checked out by every specialist under the sun, and I&#039;m a healthy 31 year old man with normal or better than normal heart, brain, lung and organ function. It was all in my head and Zoloft stopped my suffering."
