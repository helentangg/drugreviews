"Been taking 20mg per day of Lexapro for 15 months now. Was diagnosed with anxiety and slight depression. Would have panic attacks and hyperventilate. Took about 4 weeks to see full effect. Was given Klonopin as needed until Lexapro kicked in. It has made me feel so much better. I have not had a panic attack in a year. I can actually get out of bed in the morning now. At first it would make me very tired when I took it but that stopped after a few months. It made a huge difference in my life. Did not really have any side effects. A little weight gain but I would rather have that then have panic attacks."
