"I had less GI problems starting this than I did with Zoloft and other drugs like it.  I haven&#039;t gotten nausea or diarrhea. My appetite is lower which is good since the other meds made me gain weight. I actually noticed myself feeling pretty good after about a month on 10mg. My doctor then increased me to 20mg. At the dose I had no problem with my social anxiety and my general anxiety was close to zero. It also worked amazingly for my depression."
