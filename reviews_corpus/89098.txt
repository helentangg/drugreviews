"Living with a depressed husband and my parents passing within 16 months of each other threw me into two years of depression.  When I finally sought help, my doctor put me on generic Celexa.  Within a month, I felt a lot better; however, I was nauseous and woke up at 3am for the first 3 months.  I&#039;m glad I stuck it out because after that, I was fine for about 2 years when it stopped working.  Over the past 3 years I have tried 3 other anti depressants but nothing has worked or they increased my blood pressure so my doctor suggested trying Celexa again.  I&#039;m hoping I won&#039;t have the side effects this time but feel they are worth it for two years of normal living."
