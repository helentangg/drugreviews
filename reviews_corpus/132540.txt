"Doxepin for sleep?.  My new psychiatrist has prescribed this drug . New because my previous doctor passed away. That man was a God send for years and years to me. 
I don&#039;t sleep but 4 or 5 hours a night.  Broken up 2 hours at a time. But doxepin? Seriously?  Is this some kind of cruel joke?
Can anyone hear me? I CAN NOT SLEEP!!!
HERE I AM RIGHT NOW 2:12AM. Perhaps next he will add melatonin, a warm glass of milk and journaling before bed....lol. Maybe Yoga, chanting and acupuncture.  I give up.
It has been 47 days now on this drug. My last night of this ridiculousness."
