"I have been using Cymbalta for over a year now.  I have since discontinued.  The withdrawals are awful... brain zaps, nausea, dizziness, sweats, fever, body aches all over.  I have also gained 10 to 15 lbs since taking this medication.  I am active and do not eat crazy.  This medication worked at first but the side effects are awful.  I want to start a family and it&#039;s time for me to ween off my medicines. "
