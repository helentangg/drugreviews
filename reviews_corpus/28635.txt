"Lexapro did help my depression and anxiety, but I had a lot of strange side effects while on it. I believe it made my blood read &quot;pre-diabetic&quot; when I never in my life had a history of that. As soon as I got off, my blood went back to normal. I also became severely anemic-again, could be a coincidence, but when I went off, my blood was fine. It also made me feel confused mentally. Some weight gain as well. I have tried so many antidepressants, and I  get so many side effects. It&#039;s a shame, because my depression is back with a vengeance."
