"I have been taking Pristiq for 1 week. I loved how it lifted me up right away. I was on Cymbalta for 5 years and was having panic attacks and very stressed out and wasn&#039;t working anymore.  I have noticed mild headache off and on and NO sex drive, like short tempered too, oh and night sweats started  and we don&#039;t like that,  but from what I have read it should lighten up. I do feel better and will give it a chance like with any new medication your body has to get used to it.  Hope this one works! I have even backed off on my smoking which is a plus! Good luck to every one."
