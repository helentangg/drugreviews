"I have taken this drug for two years.  First at 20 mg for one year, and now at 10 mg.  It worked starting in less than a week.  It did get to the point where I was blitzed (sleepy) way too much at 20mg.  It is a libido killer, that is true, sad to say.  And I got fat.  However, the antidote is to work out like crazy.  I ballooned from 207lb to 222lb, and today I am now at 205lb &amp; dropping.  The drug makes you want to eat; I don&#039;t think the drug directly makes you fat.  My depression went from a 9 out of 10 to a 1.  My anxiety went from an 8 out of 10 to a 3.  So, the drug is worth it.  No there is no perfect drug, but if you want to be well, well...consider what I say, and best wishes as you work towards remission."
