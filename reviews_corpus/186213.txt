"I started on 50mg and went up to 100mg. It has been wonderful for stabilizing my moods. I lost my insurance and went off. It was horrible. I was in horrible shape and had to go back on it at full price. I now feel like I am stuck on it. I experience dizziness at times, gained 40 pounds in the 2 years I&#039;ve been on it."
