"Took 5 mg on a Friday, it put me to sleep for 12 hours. Took another 5 mg the next day and my chest seized up and my left arm lost sensation. I then started having heart arrhythmia every minute to the point where my entire left side of my chest hurt. I had no energy for the entire weekend. I felt depressed and miserable and in pain. I tried one more time Sunday night before bed and it woke me up from a dead sleep with chest pain and arrhythmia.  I still have chest pain and arrhythmia and I&#039;ve been off of it for 1 week. My energy levels are still low and I get out of breath easily. I have never had any problems cardio wise in the past."
