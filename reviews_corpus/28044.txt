"I was suffering with panic disorder with agoraphobia for 10 years.  It started off pretty innocuous,  a few trips to the ER, calling out of work... As my symptoms got worse I became more and more housebound.  Going ANYWHERE, even a trip to the supermarket was miserable.I couldnt take my kids to the park.I had to quit my job because of the distance and panic attacks. I loved to travel but I could no longer get on a plane, forget getting to the airport.  I literally tried everything. Finally I cracked.  my doc prescribed me lexapro. I was so scared but so desperate.  It has completely given me my life back. Slowly, surely, persistently I began to drive again. 2 years later I am me again. Fight through the side effects. Don&#039;t waste your life."
