"I was put on Sertraline for panic attacks.  The first few months were good.  Only side effects were  brain zaps and an overall strange feeling.  First few weeks I had racing thoughts,  high blood pressure, and feeling like iI had too much caffeine. It slowed down and my panic attacks got  less. But,  I did gain weight like another review mentioned. Not just a few pounds.... like 25.  I was constantly craving carbs, and had a huge bloated feeling all of the time.  I had to get off of this medicine unfortunately because of that."
