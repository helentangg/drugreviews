"I have had depression as far back as I can remember,  diagnosed with GA and major depression along with PTSD due to two life changing events I went though. I&#039;ve tried zoloft (did nothing ) Effexor XR ( Made me sleep 24/7) Celexa ( caused SEVERE anxiety attacks) and just started Cymbolta, on day 7 and I can&#039;t believe how much better I already feel at 30mg 1x day. I also just had 2 major back surgeries and am learning to walk again at age 35, yet despite my trials, I feel happier, positive, lowered anxiety etc. First day I did have severe throwing up spells, but that&#039;s gone, low appetite still but a good thing for me, INCREASED sex drive &amp; sleep like a baby. I take it at 8 everyday.  Good luck, everyone&#039;s different!"
