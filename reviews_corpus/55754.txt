"I am 140 lb, 29 year old woman. I was prescribed 150 mg of Venlafaxine XR. I only took it for 5 days due to the horrendous side effects. I experienced dry mouth, excessive sweating, blurred vision, constipation, and increased heart rate. I wasn&#039;t on it long enough to determine its effectiveness; I wasn&#039;t willing to deal with side effects. My doctor switched me to Wellbutrin and I have not experienced any withdrawal symptoms."
