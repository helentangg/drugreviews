"I have been taking paroxetine for 3 weeks and it has helped alot. I could tell the first week! I had anxiety, panic attacks and insomnia and it has helped in all areas. I even got my appetite back! Just trying to get back to &quot;normal&quot; sleep pattern. My pharmacists told me about melatonin 1.5 mg a night and it is helping as well. Good luck and don&#039;t let all the negative stuff freak you out like it did me!  "
