"Been on it for 16  years now.   Was on 100mg daily but change of lifestyle and reduced this to 50mg about 15 years ago.  About a year ago I weaned myself off the medication (over a period of 3 months) but bipolar began to manifest itself to a point that I resumed the 50mg dosage.   I am not aware of any side effects of my medication, but do appreciate the overall feeling of well-being and contentment that was not there during my recent trial of not taking medication."
