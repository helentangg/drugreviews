"I&#039;ve been diagnosed with GAD with panic attacks. We have now tried cipralex (canadian version of Lexapro). I started on 10 mg and it seemed to help a bit. It helped with the protruding thoughts of suicide (without intent)  I&#039;ve been on 20 mg for about 2.5 weeks. I take it at night because it makes me tired. I still have a lot of anxiety in the morning and have to take ativan to get relief. I&#039;ve been noticing the last few days that the negative thoughts are popping back in my head. When it happens, I feel like a panic attack is going to start but it goes away. I&#039;m wondering if I&#039;m suffering a bit of OCD.  Has anyone tried 30mg of cipralex and has it helped with anxiety and OCD?"
