"I have been taking Pristiq for about 5 months now and after an initial positive reaction...it has let me down.  After about 2 months my dosage was increase from 50mg to 100mg.  All was well for another short time until a massive and quick weight gain began (25lbs). I was constantly tired but a complete insomniac. Neck and jaw tightening were also a constant.  My dose was lowered back to 50mg which helped, again for only a short time. I am now on my 4th day off the drug and feel &quot;crashed&quot;. Wishing everyone the best."
