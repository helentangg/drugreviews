"I am back on Lexapro after 2 years off. I commenced taking 20mg about 6 days ago and the side effects were quite severe for the first few days (No appetite, upset stomach, insomnia, fogginess, grinding, jittery, cold sweats and no sex drive). However, that has subsided a little and I am now feeling quite calm and much less toxic towards myself. I am actually feeling quite carefree for a change and things don&#039;t seem to be affecting me as they had been for too long...my head is giving me a holiday. It is great to know that they helped me before and I know that they are going to help me get through again."
