"Felt positive effects immediately at 10 mg. Had one day of diarrhea and some nausea but that went away when I started taking it after dinner. I&#039;m going to ask to be bumped up to 20 mg on my next appt. 

Very happy with Trintellix. Works better than Wellbutrin, Pristiq or Lexapro and side effects are much less."
