"For the PTSD, Insomnia, anxiety &amp; depression, I take Lunesta 3 mg, Prazosin 2mg (for the PTSD dreams), Doxepin 75mg, &amp; have Xanax for the anxiety. I take it as when needed. Zoloft 200mg is used for depression &amp; is working.

Lunesta used to work alone. Once the PTSD reared its ugly head again, Prazosin was added. The nightmares are much better. However, the insomnia went on a rampage so, Doxipen was added, first at 50 mg for a week (didn&#039;t help much) so, the doc increase to 75mg. 

It&#039;s 2:26am east coast. I&#039;m going to stay with what was prescribed for this coming week &amp; hope for the best although so far, hope isn&#039;t helping."
