"I have been on Lexapro for 4 years and have gained 40 lbs.I have always been able to control my weight, but have gained steadily 10 lbs a year since beginning Lexapro. Other than the weight gain, overall, I felt like I was doing good on Lexapro until the last 6 months or so and even tried to get off of it, but was not successful. I went to see my doctor and she switched me to Pristiq. I feel so much better mentally and physically. I have been able to drop some weight and feel that there is hope for getting these extra pounds off.  I&#039;m not nearly as lethargic and wake up in much better spirits than I have in a while. I am hopeful this medicine will work for me and that I am also able to lose the weight."
