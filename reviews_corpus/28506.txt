"Lexapro has changed my life. I am now able to participate in so many activities that my anxiety wouldn&#039;t allow me to do prior. There is side effects. I don&#039;t sleep great and have crazy dreams. Dry mouth, skin and eyes is noticeably worse. Sexual feelings came back after a few months. Plus have more gas and stomach upset. But even with the side effects, my life has greatly improved."
