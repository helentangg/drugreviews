"I&#039;ve been off and on the prozac for over a year now. Keep reading stuff on the internet about its side effects, then flush them down the drain. But then I get back on the medicine. I can say that I feel its effects after just one dose, it feels like a pretty strong drug and I&#039;m only on 10mg. Don&#039;t drink too much caffeine on prozac! I&#039;ve had the worst anxiety attacks if I drink an energy drink after taking my dose of prozac. It does help me get stuff done and stay motivated and I guess it helps with general anxiety as well. It does kind of make me impulsive though but I&#039;m learning to make better decisions while on the medicine. I think it helps over all and I will continue to stay on it for the foreseeable future."
