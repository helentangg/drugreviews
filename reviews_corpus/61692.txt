"I rarely post online reviews, but I recognize that most people only post reviews when they don&#039;t like something, so I wanted to sort of offset that here.

I&#039;m in my mid-twenties and female.  I&#039;ve suffered with severe anxiety and depression for several years due to trauma.  Enter Celexa.  To be fair, I went to therapy for several months before deciding to go on medication (and was feeling a bit better), but I still experienced severe anxiety that the therapy wasn&#039;t helping.  I started feeling better after the first week on Celexa, and things have only improved from there.  I&#039;ve been taking it for around three months and my anxiety/depression is almost completely gone.  I&#039;ve had no sexual side effects whatsoever, no weight gain, no issues."
