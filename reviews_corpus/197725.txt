"I have been on this medication for 3 weeks now and feel a lot better and my thinking is clearer. I feel like moving around more and working out whereas before I did not have the energy to do anything. I have lost 7 pounds in the meanwhile. I have had some loss of having orgasms but still have the desire for sex."
