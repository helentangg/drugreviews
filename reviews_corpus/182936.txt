"I initially took Cymbalta for distonia, which was involuntary movement in my hands caused by a type of Muscular Dystrophy. A combination of Cymbalta, Neurontin, and Tramadol are very effective in reducing my pain. After several months I noticed a great change in my personality. To make a long story short, I realize I&#039;ve dealt with anxiety most of my life. Cymbalta has literally changed my life. If this medication had been available in the 1960&#039;s or 1970&#039;s my life would have been dramatically different. I can&#039;t imagine life without Cymbalta."
