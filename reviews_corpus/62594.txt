"I&#039;ve been taking citalopram for about 8 months now for mild depression and anxiety. I started off taking 10mg and have slowly increased to 30mg. I haven&#039;t noticed any change in my low grade depression, but have noticed that I&#039;m less anxious in social situations. I&#039;m going to stop taking it after talking to my doctor because the side effects aren&#039;t worth it for me. I sweat profusely which offsets the social anxiety benefit as it embarrasses me to be so sweaty (it&#039;s summer in South Carolina). I&#039;m also really tired all the time and constantly crave food. So far I&#039;ve gained 15lbs since starting citalopram. Overall, the minor benefit doesn&#039;t outweigh the crappy side effects I&#039;m having."
