"I experienced abdominal pain due to IBS for years.  These pains were present no matter what I ate.  While these pains were at their peak I could hear gurgling in my stomach area therefore I knew they were gas related. Doctors tried every test known but couldn&#039;t find anything wrong.  I had nearly given up hope.  The only thing that seemed to help at all was activated charcoal.   One day a nurse practitioner prescribed me nortriptyline to trial.  She told me that it wasn&#039;t for IBS but it may help with some of its symptoms.  Within a week my pains went away and have been gone now for 2 years.  I take one pill every night before bed.  I am another who will say that nortriptyline has changed my life."
