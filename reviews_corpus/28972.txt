"I have been suffering from Severe Depression, Anxiety and Panic attacks for 4 years. I have been on every anti-depressent and anti-anxiety med known along with mood stabilizers. All of these at the same time and always tweaking doses. I had no life I just wanted to be alone from my wife and kids and people in general. This hurt that I was not able to be the dad and husband I used to be. I have been on Lexapro for 4 weeks now and for the first time I have no anxiety or depression. It works for me"
