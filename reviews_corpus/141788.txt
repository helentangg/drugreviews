"I started on Lexapro 5mg November 2010 due to bad depression, anxiety just really bad, so went on it after seeing specialist. Upped my dosage to 10mg March 2011 and stabilized out, not up not down like normally off medicines. Back to 3 times a week exercise, no grog or eating benders anymore, lost 8 kgs (only another 6 to be back to my perfect weight) sleep better, helping me relax more in social situations as have bad GAD social, so keeping on it - no side effects - takes a while to level out so persist with it and give it a decent go."
