"Before taking this medication I was experiencing sleepless nights. Sometimes this would happen for 3 nights in a row. There was no reason for me to feel anxiety or feel as if a panic attack was coming on. My panic and anxiety feelings were in my stomach&amp; my throat. I felt like I could scream but I could never get it loud enough. I was also experiencing stomach ulcer symptoms.  I had no clue what was wrong w/ me. At work I started to experience social anxiety.  I would feel panicked, my face would get flushed &amp; my neck and chest would break out in hives. One other extremely annoying symptom was getting up during the night to pee when I really  didn&#039;t have to. My doctor prescribed 25 then 50 then 75 then 100mg of zoloft and I&#039;m 100% better."
