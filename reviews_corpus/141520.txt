"Worked wonders for stabilising my mood - and my ability to leave the house! Been taking it for about two years now. only thing I find is it starts to &#039;wear off&#039; after a few months. My doctor has me come off them for a month and then go back on when this happens and I find this much more effective than upping the dose. 
Main side effect for me has been insomnia. A small price to pay for the huge positive impact Lexapro has made on my life."
