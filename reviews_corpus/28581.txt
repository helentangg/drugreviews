"When I became pre-menopausal I developed increased anxiety, panic attacks, heart racing, etc. My doctor recommended Lexapro. Within 1 week of taking this medicine I noticed a difference. I became calmer, easier to live with and all my anxiety symptoms disappeared. Literally got my life back. This is a miracle."
