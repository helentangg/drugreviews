"I have only taken Lexapro (generic) for 3 days now.  Dr. put me 5mg but told me to cut it in half for about a week.  This morning when I woke up I felt GREAT!  Not hypomanic great, just great all around.  I didn&#039;t have the tormenting thoughts in my head as soon as woke up like I usually did.  I have been on &quot;depressed mode&quot; with my BiPolar since at least May 2015 and I felt &quot;real&quot; and &quot;normal&quot; (whatever that is lol) this morning.  I am very sensitive to medications with side effects of drowsiness and I have felt a little sleepy but not bad.  I can actually accomplish things!  I have had diarrhea but if I am going to feel like this then I can deal with it and it will probably go away."
