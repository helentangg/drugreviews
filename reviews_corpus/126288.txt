"This is my first experience taking medication for anxiety or any mood disorder.  I experience anxiety, not panic attacks, just general focusing on things that should not matter.  I am 4th day of 10mg and already feeling less anxious.  Though I had sharp gas pain on the second day, I have had no other gastrointestinal issues.  I was nauseous and tired on the first day but now I have no side effects that are problematic.  I can still sleep but I find it harder to get tired in the evening and if I do wake up in the night, it&#039;s hard to fall back asleep. "
