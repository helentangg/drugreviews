"I stayed on Celexa for about 6 years, as it was the SSRI with the least side effects.  It worked fine for my depression, and took 6 weeks to become effective (that&#039;s about the same as I experienced with all SSRIs).  I ended up going off of it due to profuse sweating and elevated blood pressure (my normal is 110/70, it shot to 135/90).  Diarrhea, weird dreams and constant tiredness were also problems."
