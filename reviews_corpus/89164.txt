"Update from my post a few weeks ago:

I have been on Celexa now for about a month and have increased my dosage of Celexa to 20 mg. I feel like I can concur the world again!  The night sweats have passed and I am calm and collected now.  My thoughts are not focused around worry anymore and I can rationalize every day challenges again. Celexa has changed my life!"
