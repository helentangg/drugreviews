"I have been on sertraline for about 3-4 months now for Depression/Anxiety, OCD and PTSD. At first I thought it was helping, but now that I think about it I feel foggy all the time and kind of lifeless. I feel underwater as if I just drift through the day. I can&#039;t focus very well, and am constantly dissociating. I also have been having really severe suicidal thoughts, not that I&#039;d carry them out, but I go from 1-10 in such a short amount of time it freaks me out the things I think about. Also it is near impossible to sleep on this medicine. I never have been an insomniac, but sleep terribly since starting this. I think I&#039;m going to start weening myself off the 100 mg and see if my mind and thoughts start to clear."
