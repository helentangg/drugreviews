"I have always experienced small bouts of anxiety and depression before but nothing that ever really stuck around. A few months ago something caused me to become anxious, which lead to a panic attack which then lead to depression, and no matter what I did I just couldn&#039;t shake it. I couldn&#039;t eat, sleep, no desire to do anything, always anxious. I went to my doctor who put me on Lexapro. It immediately helped with my anxiety, and within a few days my depression lifted. I have now been on Lexapro for over 2 months and feel back to my normal self.
Initial side effects: Very sleepy for about 3 days, nausea for a couple of nights.
I still experience: Vivid dreams and low sex drive.
I never experienced: Weight gain or insomnia.
Overall very happy."
