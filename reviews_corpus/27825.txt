"I would rate the effectiveness of this medication pretty high. I took this medication about 12 years ago but it seems to be working better this go round. I feel more cheerful, am sleeping a little better and the best part is less anxiety which was severe. I&#039;m super happy about the decrease in anxiety I&#039;ve experienced. I&#039;m probably going to ask for  an increase in dosage. I&#039;m currently on 20 mg. I wish you well to those of you who are just beginning this medication."
