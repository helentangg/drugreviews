"Lexapro changed my life. I was a very moody person and never considered medication until my doctor did. I am so glad I am on it. The only side I have is that I get these little &quot;shocks&quot; that only last a short time but can be annoying. The strange thing is that they start about 22-24 hours after a dose. After I take it they are gone till the next day. Other than that I love it."
