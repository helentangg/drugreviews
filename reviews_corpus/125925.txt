"I took this medication when both of my parents died within 2 weeks. It worked really great for about a year. now I feel like it doesn&#039;t work like it used to and maybe my body&#039;s gotten used to it. But if you ever miss a dose you have extreme nightmares. So I am scared to go to sleep without taking it and thinking about maybe trying something new."
