"I personally think celexa worked very well for me. I got on it due to a lot of anxiety in college and I started to have panic attacks but then realized it helped with some depression as well. I was very foggy for the first 2 weeks and didn&#039;t feel like myself but stuck it out and it worked great for 3 months! I just got bumped up to 20mg because it seems to be wearing off but so far so great! stick with it."
