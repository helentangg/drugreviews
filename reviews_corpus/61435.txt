"I was on citalopram a few years ago for a year. It helped my sadness, my mood swings, my anger and irritability I felt day in and day out. It was a great med. My only complaint is how numbing it was to the good feelings as much as the bad feelings. I stayed on it because it was still better than waking up and hating everyday before it even started. The gas was almost intolerable only because I have chronic idiopathic constipation. I weighed out the good and bad &amp; feeling mentally good for me and especially for my my kids definitely won. I&#039;m now on it again...3 days in and already feel more calm and less moody. It&#039;s a great feeling."
