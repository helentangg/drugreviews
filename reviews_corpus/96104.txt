"I was prescribed Zoloft when I saw a psychiatrist and described my anxiety when at home, and my very, very bad social anxiety that has left me with virtually no friends and I never leave the house. I was also slightly depressed. At 100mg of Zoloft, it has absolutely no effect on my anxiety. I gave it a 4 because it&#039;s improved my energy level and made me a lot less depressed, I just wish it would help what it was prescribed for."
