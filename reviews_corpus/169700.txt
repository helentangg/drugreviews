"I recently had a neck injury which caused the nerve to the left arm to be damaged.  I used 300mg Lyrica and 50mg of amitriptyline, at first, and then increased to 100mg at night, to help with the pain and allow me to get to sleep.  I went off the Lyrica after 4 months but have chosen to stay on the amitriptyline.  The bonus that I experienced with using amitriptyline was that for the first time in over 20yrs I was able to get more than 4 hours of sleep per night.  This has changed my life dramatically as I have energy that I haven&#039;t experienced in many years and I wake up fully rested and ready to meet the day."
