"took it after baby was born in September 2015 felt normal again in December so I decided to get off. Felt fine until about a week ago in April. 2nd day on it. Makes u feel jittery and crazier for a few days but I know it will get better if I stay on it. definitely recommend not being alone first week u are on it and make sure u have some help!!!"
