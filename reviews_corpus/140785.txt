"First day taking lexapro 20mg I experienced fuzzy vision, tingling sensation in my arms, yawning, and tiredness. Second day I decided to take it before bed, woke up 2 hours later with nausea, weakness, dry mouth, dizziness, vomiting and tingling in my arms. Talking to my doctor tomorrow to see if I should switch, not taking it tonight. My anxiety did subside in the last 2 days though."
