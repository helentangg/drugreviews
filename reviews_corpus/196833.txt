"At first I loved paxil because I wasn&#039;t crying all the time but even as I&#039;m writing this I feel like there are sprinklers going off in my head. I&#039;m always forgetting things, 0 sex drive, either I&#039;m in a euphoric state of mind or completely absent minded. I constantly feel stoned (and not the good kind).I just started a new job and I can hardly focus."
