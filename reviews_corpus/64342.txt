"I started 50mg of Sertraline bc of depression, racing thoughts and lots of suicidal urges/thoughts. I&#039;ve been on the meds for 3 weeks now. I haven&#039;t had those major depressed moments like I did. Its like all that crazy head stuff fell away. I&#039;m not super anxious anymore either. I feel calmer and less stressed/angry. I had a lot going on. I decided to get help instead of trying to do this alone. I have had some insomnia but if that&#039;s my only side effect, I will take it!! In the past I always stopped treatment when I started feeling better...this time I&#039;m going to continue for my own safety. Depression is not a good place to be. Wish all readers the best!"
