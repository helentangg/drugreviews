"I have suffered from anxiety and mood swings most of my life.  But since my divorce and living alone the depression was becoming debilitating.....  Feeling paralyzed by fear and barely functioning by taking Xanax.  Friends and family were very concerned that I was going to drop off the edge.  I am highly sensitive to medication.  And having tried over 1/2 dozen antidepressants with side effects, I thought I was doomed to a life of torment.  A friend was taking it and liked it, So, I tried it.  I did have side effects in the beginning.  Nausea, loss appetite, racing heart but most are now gone.  I still clench some and my jaw gets sore.  But I am so much better! 4 months was a big turning point for me. So don&#039;t lose hope!"
