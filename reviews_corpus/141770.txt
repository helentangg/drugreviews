"I have taken Lexapro for three months and never felt better after suffering a stroke at the age of 23 due to a birth defect in my brainstem.  I was switched to Celexa because my insurance does not cover Lexapro. I felt all the anxiety, panic attacks, trouble sleeping, not wanting to get off the couch return. I went back on Lexapro and will pay whatever the cost. The side effects, for me, are  weight gain. I gained 10 pounds despite running 6 to 12 miles a day. I crave bad, bad food, which I never used to care about. My sex drive is, well, gone. I have to work on it. I guess 10lbs, paying the monthly price at the pharmacy, and the side effects above are well worth my quality of life."
