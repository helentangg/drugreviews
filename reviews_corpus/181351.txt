"I had been having anxiety and other symptoms such as weight loss.  I was diagnosed with OCD and started on 10mg prozac. I battled with side effects for the first month of increased anxiety, nauseousness and sleeping problems.  At about the 5 week mark the negative side effects went away and I started to feel some relief from the anxiety caused by the OCD.  I was increased to 20mg which seems to be enough for me.
I have now been on it for over a year.  I feel so much better.  Like a weight is lifted off of my shoulders and I no longer worry and obsess.  I have gained some weight but the anxiety had made me lose weight so I think I am able to eat now because I feel better.  I don&#039;t sweat the small stuff in life anymore!!"
