"I&#039;ve been on this for two weeks. When I first started at 10 I had some digestive trouble, nothing bad, and I had some lethargy and brain fuzziness. By day three I noticed my anxiety increasing and constant dull headaches. Day 5 I felt better. Day 7 I got nausea and slight diarrhea. Days 8, 9, 10 I was physically better but more easily agitated. Day twelve bad nausea and diarrhea for 10 hrs. No pill today, just not for me. Still have the headaches through out!"
