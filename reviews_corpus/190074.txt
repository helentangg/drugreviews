"Have tried all families of the tricyclics and xifaxin for my IBS-D. Desipramine is the only medication that has helped and continues to provide relief. It takes about a month to start working and gets better and better over time. The only side effect is trouble sleeping and it does have an odd effect on my testicles which makes them feel tight. However, for Ibs-D this is the only med that works. I take Imodium as well when I am having a bad day or before a big event and this calms my nerves because Imodium always helps. After about 3 months on desipramine, Imodium is no longer needed."
