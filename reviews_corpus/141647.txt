"This medicine has been amazing for me. I don&#039;t feel high, just like a normal person for the first time in years. It&#039;s like a huge weight has been lifted from me. I am very sensitive to medication, so I waited a long time to ask my new doctor for something else. I had been using St. John&#039;s Wort for a while and it really helped but I think I became immune to it. 

When I started on Lexapro, I cut the 10 mg tablets in half and only took 5 mg for the first few days, then moved to 10 mg. The higher dose made me restless and anxious and unable to sleep, plus stomach cramps. The lower dose has some stomach discomfort and nighttime wakefulness, but antacids and melatonin control it. Plus, I&#039;m losing extra weight!"
