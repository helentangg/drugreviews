"I took Zoloft for a long time and it stopped working.  I am so glad it did.  Pristiq is 100 x better.  It controls my anxiety and leaves me clear headed, i.e. not numb.  I experienced some insomnia and increased sweating during the first week but it went away.  The only side effect I experience now is constipation, which I hope will go away because I don&#039;t plan on parting from this medicine for a long time.  It&#039;s been a life saver for me and I love it."
