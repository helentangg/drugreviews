"I&#039;ve tried a lot of medication, nutritional products, &quot;self medication&quot;, etc... since I started having severe anxiety and depression around 1998.  I&#039;ve been taking Pristiq for about a year, and it is the first medication to successfully treat both my anxiety and depression.  Most treatments made one better, while the other got worse.  
The only real negative with the medicine is the short half-life. You&#039;ll definitely notice if you miss a dose.  Missing two is not a pleasant experience at all.  
Since being on the medication, I&#039;ve been much more productive at work, more social, more driven, more attentive to my son, and just more happy and at peace overall."
