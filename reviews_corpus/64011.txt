"I&#039;ve been on Paxil for 18 years, when it stopped working. My doctor put me on a tapering schedule while adding in Zoloft, currently I&#039;m at 15mg Paxil and 50mg Zoloft. I started feeling a little anxious at night and so I asked my doctor if I could go up to 75mg Zoloft, she ok&#039;d it. I took it tonight, with the 15 mg Paxil. OMG I&#039;m having the worst panic attack! Not only am I feeling slow from the decrease in Paxil the extra 25 mg of Zoloft has me freaking out! Don&#039;t know if I should go up on the Zoloft slower? I can&#039;t imagine feeling this way tomorrow!"
