"I took Prozac for about five months 1989-90.  I felt buoyant for the first six weeks, then less so.  After three months or so, my mood was down and my fingers were stiff and painful upon waking.  After four months, both hands and feet were in pain and did not function for an hour after waking.  The condition persisted, in an ever-diminishing form, for five years after discontinuation of the medicine.  I am told that my reaction was rare; nevertheless, it happened to me."
