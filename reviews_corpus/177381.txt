"I am 67, a few years ago I was firmly diagnosed with a rare SCN9a genetic defect/sodium channelopathy/severe pain disorder as the cause of decades of chronic pain with chronic recurrent peripheral neuropathy with atrophy on nerve biopsies.  For decades my pain was mistakenly diagnosed as fibromyalgia. A few months ago I read that duloxetine may help neuropathic pain by acting as a sodium ion channel blocker and since my condition is due to excessive sodium ion release, I thought that it may help me so I started taking it.  The result was so remarkable that I feel impelled to spread the word to others with this rare disease."
