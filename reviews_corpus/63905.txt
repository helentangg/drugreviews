"For me this SSRI didn&#039;t work at all.
I have intrusive thoughts (no compulsions) and after 8 months on various dosages (even on 225 mg) nothing special happened. Side effects were tolerable: tinnitus (only when I was on 150 mg or higher), restless legs, vivid dreams and some teeth grinding. 
I had far better experience with fluvoxamine (on it for 2 years) and escitalopram(6 years), but they both pooped-out."
