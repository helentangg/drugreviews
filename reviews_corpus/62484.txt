"To all starting out on Celexa, please don&#039;t judge it by the first 3 weeks.  I am now at 8 weeks and I&#039;ve never felt better.  My doctor said the full effect will be felt at 8 weeks - I can truly tell. The first 3 weeks I was beyond tired, getting up and getting to work was painful.  I&#039;m usually a night owl but I was ready to crash after dinner every night. By week 4 all of my energy came back.  My moods were amazing, my social skills did a 180 degree turn. This medication truly changed my life.  I haven&#039;t tried anything before for my anxiety/depression as I am in my early 20&#039;s. I knew I needed help when my illness began to destroy my personal relationships.  The constant yawing, tiredness, fogginess will go away. Your body will adapt."
