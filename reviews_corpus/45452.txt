"I suffered panic attacks and anxiety most of my life but started having several a day after a move and job change.   I tried Zoloft 25 mg first and had extreme jitteriness, nausea and shaking (sertraline reaction).  My doctor switched me to a low dose of Prozac to start with (5 mg...half a 10 mg tablet). After 2 weeks he moved me to 10 mg but I had nausea and shakiness.  He said to go back to 5 mg.  I had to continue Xanax as needed for my first month.  The attacks slowly became less severe then disappeared.  1 month now since an attack and I only take 5 mg.  This has changed my life."
