"So far so good.  I m only four days into taking it. I take it at lunchtime everyday, and notice I get a bit drowsy and yawn like crazy for a couple of hours after I take it.  HOWEVER, my anxiety is already feeling better so this side effect is nothing in comparison!  My anxiety was becoming debilitating, just so much stress... lost my mom to cancer, my cat passed away, going through a possible separation, just horribly stressful situations now.  I have a lot of support from my family and friends and feel like this is first step in getting back in check."
