"38 year old femaie, working mom and wife, 3 year old son, years of depression and anxiety augmented by C-section/spinal surgeries beginning 2006. 

Lexapro - Prozac - Wellbutrin -- all failed. Pristiq broke through the darkness ... but after a very rough period of uptake. Took three weeks -- almost to the day -- to achieve a positive impact. Continued Wellbutrin with Pristiq 50 mg 1xday morning dose. Also Suboxone for opioid dependence management 8 mg daily.

I used to have suicidal thoughts, anxiety, sweating, fatigue, inability to focus or concentrate ... THEN one morning things were different, I felt better, I felt like me again! Pristiq works, but buckle your seat belt while it gets into your system."
