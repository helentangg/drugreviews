"First day I took this and I started having jaw pain and eye twitches. By the second day I had the eye twitches, worsening jaw pain, a rash on my jaw, and extreme heat on my jaw. Also had a rash on my chest. Immediately stopped taking the medicine. My muscles on the right side of my face felt a little weak so I called the doctor. I don&#039;t feel I need to go to the ER quite yet but my husband is keeping a close eye on me. (I&#039;m not usually allergic to any medication at all)."
