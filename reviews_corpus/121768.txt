"I am a senior business executive that run a daily regimen of 300mg Venlafaxine, amongst other things.  I have been on it for 11 years, and it saved my life.  I have suffered from severe depression since early childhood, but through a combination of intelligence, willpower and sheer drive I managed to function and build a stellar academic and professional career.  By my late 20s things were starting to unravel though, and it was just a matter of time before suicide or my high-risk lifestyle took my life.  Venlafaxine changed all that, it saved my life.  It wasn&#039;t overnight, and over the years I added many more medications to the regimen, but in the end it given me a chance. "
