"I&#039;ve been on many medications through the years, and this is the first one I&#039;ve been on a medication that didn&#039;t make me drowsy, and had side effects I could tolerate. Having Major Depressive Disorder, PTSD, and Anxiety, but also having issues with psych medication side effects; I&#039;ve been quite happy with this medication.
It takes the edge off my negative moods, and at times renders me ambivalent-- which is better than before considering my PTSD anxiety was driving me to suicidal inclinations. However, if you aren&#039;t dealing with severe depression and anxiety, I&#039;d suggest something less intense. Also, my medicaid covered this medication, but many insurance companies wont, and the original price is naught to scoff at."
