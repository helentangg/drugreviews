"I suffer from PTSD and also anxiety and mild depression. I hit the bottle and have managed to regain some element of control. My Doctor prescribed these tablets for me, 50mg and even after the first day I felt so much different. I felt that I had the capability to handle stresses and strains both in work and at home. I know its early days for me, but signs are definitely positive. I have had a few side effects such as upset stomach and a few restless nights but those pale to insignificance, when I reflect on how this is drug is definitely helping me. Obviously this drug is not for everyone....overall, a positive experience for me. Stay strong!"
