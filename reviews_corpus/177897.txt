"I have been using Cymbalta for several years now as part of my treatment plan for Chronic Pain. My pain is related to having Fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis in my hips, spine, knees and neck, impingement in the hips as well, and trigger points throughout my body. 

After trying several other medications, and gaining some amount of weight, my doctor wrote the prescription and I started at 30mg for the day. I now take 60mg in the morning and 60mg at night and it makes a huge difference in maintaining my pain levels. 

I use it now as part of my daily &quot;medicine cocktail&quot; and hope to continue for a long time still to come!"
