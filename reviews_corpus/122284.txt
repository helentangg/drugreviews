"I actually struggle with the possibility of bp ii. At 6 MG I didn&#039;t have any response positive or negative except that is repressed my appetite, with infrequent feelings of rage,which were controllable with benzos (ativan).  At 9 mg I began to have extreme insomnia (probably because it metabolizes as l-amphetamine or an adderal-like substance). At this dosage the rage I would feel was too much to handle, and was very much similar to what I felt on wellbutrin.  I would caution anyone, if you have rage on wellbutrin, you may (as others have anecdotally said) have feelings of rage on emsam as well. It&#039;s worth a try still, however, as when I wasn&#039;t feeling intense anger, at 9 mg I did feel better. best of luck."
