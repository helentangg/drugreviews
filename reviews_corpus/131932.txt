"I have been on Effexor XR for years.  I have been on several other SSRIs through the years that eventually stopped working.  Effexor has been the most successful in the long term.  I take 150mg of the XR and 37.5 three times a day of the regular Effexor.  The regular was recently added as my depression has worsened due to additional stress at work.  I have not had any major side effects, even on this high of a dose.  I do agree that withdrawal is serious.  If I miss a dose, I have a buzzing feeling, crying and increase in depression almost immediately.  This is one medication that I do not go without--ever.  I am a bit worried about ever going off of it for these reasons.  I believe that this can be done safely with the help of a physician."
