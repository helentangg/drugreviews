"I have depression and high anxiety, I have had these most of my life but refused treatment. Now having a son of my own I have realized I need to be better for him. I have only been on it a week and have noticed a lot of improvements! 
I no longer feel upset about my life,I can talk to my child like he should be talked to and not because im stressed and anxious  all the time. I have had a few side affects  so far.
Weird dreams, headaches, muscle spasms, dry mouth, and tiredness. but to feel &quot;normal&quot; is worth it. I final feel like im going to be ok."
