"Seems like the whole world is on antidepressants these days.  Docs doling them like candy. I was on a low dose of lexapro for years and finally got off of it (which wasn&#039;t a pleasant experience either) I might add. I had gained 20 lbs, was exhausted with no energy a mandatory 2 hr afternoon nap,  oh yeah and it zaps your libido! All things to consider. I&#039;ve switched to Wellbutrin and seem to have much less side effects."
