"I don&#039;t represent anyone but myself (I&#039;m always skeptical about these posts).  I know everyone is different.  I&#039;ve been depressed to one degree or another my whole life, and have tried nearly every medicine that&#039;s come along, from the early tri-cyclics through MAO inhibitors, to SSRI/SNRIs.  None worked well enough in the long run to compensate for the side effects (sexual dysfunction, weight gain, others).  After 3 years of mild depression and no medicines, things got severe again.  I&#039;m in week 3 of Pristiq.  Mood improved within 24 hours, and I feel as though my brain&#039;s turned on again.  I have mild side effects (sleep and jaw clenching), but these are tolerable for the mood improvement.  Hope it keeps working, and wish everyone good luck."
