"six years ago I almost lost my life from an abusive relationship. I am 24 years old now. Luckily I am a survivor of domestic violence. From that traumatic time in my life I have been severely depressed, anxious &amp; have had thoughts of suicide. For the past six years I have been on &amp; off depression medications. Some have worked but the effects were too extreme. I tried Effexor but didn&#039;t like it too much and the withdrawal was terrible. Then I tried to work things out without medication and was doing good for a while but became very depressed/gained weight and so decided to give medications a try again. Recently started on Prozac (10 mg) about a week ago so far the low dose is good for me. I am more positive, exercise daily &amp; new diet."
