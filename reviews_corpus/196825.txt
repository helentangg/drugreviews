"I went through menopause from 50-55 and Paxil was a lifesaver.  My gynecologist prescribed it when all of the supplements for menopause symptoms were of no help.  Hot flashes have returned at the age of 60 for some reason, and I&#039;m taking Paxil again.  Working like a charm with no side effects."
