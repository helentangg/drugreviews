"I have just started taking Zoloft for my severe anxiety disorder. For the last almost year now I have been dealing with this debilitating disorder and I finally had enough went to the doctors and now I&#039;m on 25mg to start. I feel horrible (Nauseated, dizzy, feeling of pressure in my head, slight numbness in lip and jaw and itchy dry feeling in the back of my mouth) but I&#039;m praying with all these positive responses about the medicine it will help me. I&#039;m at the end of my ropes I have two small children. I&#039;m trying to go to school and my anxiety is keeping me from being able to sit in class or go into the grocery store for longer than 2 mins! It has been horrible and came on for no apparent reason. I wish you all the best!"
