"This was for my MDD,BPD, and OCD, I hated this. Sick all the time. If I didn&#039;t eat, meds made me sick. If I did, they&#039;d screw with my stomach. Everything was worse. Black and white is an understatement. I was significantly worse on these meds than without. Withdrawals were terrible. The only good thing was that insurance covered a lot of it."
