"I am 33 years old and have been depressed for as long as I can remember. This year I took the leap and accepted the fact that I need medications to continue living a functional life.  I was prescribed 20mg Celexa once a day.  For the first two months things were getting better I did experience some insomnia but that subsided after two weeks. I eventually plateaued and was given a new dose of 40mg.  Not sure how much it has helped, I constantly feel tired and lack motivation.  I will looking at other meds when I see my doc next."
