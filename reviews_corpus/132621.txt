"I give it a 5/10 because it worked for about 1-1/2 weeks and then I built up a tolerance (like I always do with all sleep medicines.. sighh..).  I was on 10 mg.  I bumped it up to 20 mg for about a week after the 10 mg lost its kick but still nothing.  

I had very vivid dreams those 2 weeks.. it almost felt like I wasn&#039;t sleeping deep enough the dreams were so vivid.  But I had more energy during the day so it must have worked.  It was nice to have my schedule back to &quot;normal&quot; for about a month (staying awake during the day).  Now I&#039;ve flip-flopped back to sleeping during the day again.

I&#039;m a chronic insomniac.  My sleep specialist even jokes that I need a sledgehammer just to knock me out.  I&#039;ve tried just about every pill both over the counter and prescription."
