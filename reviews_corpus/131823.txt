"Update to review below. I have now been on Effexor XR for six months, and I can honestly say that it&#039;s worked wonders in eliminating my depression and obsessive thinking. I wasn&#039;t able to stay on the low 37.5mg dose, as I discovered that this is a starting dose only. I have been on 150 mg for about four months, and apparently this is the lowest effective dose for achieving a therapeutic effect for most disorders. My depression has gone, and I no longer have obsessive thoughts that were making daily life a living hell. The only drawback with Effexor XR is that it has low half life, which means that it doesn&#039;t stay in your system for long, and if you miss a dose you will feel withdrawal within a few hours. This medicine has been a life saver!"
