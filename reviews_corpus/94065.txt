"On 20mg for about two months with no concrete signs of improving depression/anxiety. Dr. told me to just stop taking it as I hadn&#039;t been on it very long so didn&#039;t need to taper off. After not taking any dose for 3 days, I woke up in middle of night with excruciating stomach pain and vomited off and on for hours. Absolutely horrible. I also think there could be a negative interaction between this drug and Concerta. Just my own personal experience. I hope this drug works for you! If not, there&#039;s are hundreds others that will."
