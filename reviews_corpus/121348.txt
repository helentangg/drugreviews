"I have had panic disorder &amp; depression for years with suicidal ideation. Wouldn&#039;t leave my house! My new Doctor started me on 37.5. The side effects were awful and I almost quit taking. Worsened anxiety, nausea, you name it- I had it. After a little over a week, it was gone. Doctor put me on 75mg. I noticed a difference on day two! Less anxiety, less depression. Weird sensation in my veins like I need to go run or something. After a month I was on 150mg. I was almost living a normal life by then and actually leaving my house. side effects are gone. Now I&#039;m on 225mg. I&#039;m a different person! I feel alive! Haven&#039;t felt normal in years! I&#039;ll always have a little anxiety, but it&#039;s manageable with coping mechanisms. This med. saved my life."
