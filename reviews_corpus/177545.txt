"I just started on Cymbalta for excruciating nerve pain behind my right ear.  This nerve pain is due to nerve damage from Shingles, PHN.  I have to say that I am quite happy with the results so far.  It seemed to zap the pain in about an hour from taking my first one.  It seems to wear off by the next morning so I am going to try to up it to twice a day, hopefully I will not have trouble sleeping."
