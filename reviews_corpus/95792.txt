"My doctor prescribed 50mg Setraline to help me with depression, suicidal thoughts, and social anxiety.  I have just been taking it a week, but I am very pleased so far.  I am able to leave my apartment, go shopping in horrendous crowds and traffic, and deal with stress at work without breaking down and becoming fixated.  Fleeting thoughts of worthlessness, hopelessness, and suicide are easily pushed away.  I do deal with nausea, diarrhea, sleeplessness, and fatigue, but I make sure I eat before I take my pill and I force myself to eat each time the nausea comes on.  I may gain weight, but I do not think so because I am never hungry now.  I am hoping that the calmness remains as I continue taking Sertraline."
