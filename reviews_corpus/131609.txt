"I started off with 75mg and have stayed on it ever since because I found no reason to change it. The first day I could feel this medication working, it was a little much at first but nothing I couldn&#039;t handle. But I soon noticed that it took all my emotions away and made me dull to everything going on around me and in my life. Most don&#039;t like that but I really do, I feel as if I have no cares in the world at all. Nothing goes through my head at all, its like magic. It takes me a little bit to actually get my brain going and operating but thats fine with me. Sleep and sex drive has gone down but I still get the sleep need and if I need to preform I can.  I just don&#039;t have the desire to want sex. Its changed my life in such good ways."
