"My first post was 5/15/2015. Here&#039;s more. I&#039;m doing OK, but want to share the trouble I had when increased to 20mg. I had really good days on 10 and 15 with manageable side effects. 20 threw me for a loop after a couple days - felt worse in every way - heightened anxiety and dark depression. But - it started to get better - a bad day - a good day - two bad days - two good days. This medication takes patience and a pdoc that will explain (mine didn&#039;t) all you can be in for. I feel I&#039;m going to &quot;win&quot;, but almost feel I deserve a prize for tolerating so many side effects. I had to resort to Xanax on the really bad days. Funny those who really need Xanax hate it? Still going to stick with Lexapro - I see the light at the end of the tunnel."
