"I had a neutral experience on Prozac, my second SSRI tried for anxiety and depression. Prozac did not really help me but it did not do any harm. I experienced very few side effects aside from increased anxiety for the first week or so. However, I was unable to come off of my klonopin because it did not help  my anxiety and I was more suicidal after 5 months of being on it than when I started it."
