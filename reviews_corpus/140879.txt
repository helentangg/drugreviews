"Im 17 years old and started suffering with depression a couple months after my dad died and thats when I was put on Lexapro 10mg. The side effects were horrible for the first couple of days, extreme nausea and massive headaches. About a couple of weeks later we upped my dosage to 20mg and it helped me with me depression a little bit for a while but now (about 4 months later) my depression has gone back to how it was before I started Lexapro. Ive also noticed that it has made me extremely exhausted all of the time. I have to sleep at least 12 hours to function and even then it is hard to wake up and carry out my day. This may work for some but it did not work well for me. Im going to try to switch antidepressants within the next few days."
