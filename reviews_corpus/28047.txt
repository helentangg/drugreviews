"The first six weeks were hell.  Increased anxiety so severe I lost seventeen pounds. I&#039;m now five months in and have never felt better.  I&#039;m on 20 mg  of lexapro once daily 20mg of Buspirone twice daily.  .5 mg of Clonazepam to be taken once daily if needed, I rarely need it.  I would suggest trying a physician that will prescribe a low dosage of Clonazepam from the start, it would have saved me a great deal of suffering .  Clonazepam is addictive so most doctors hesitate to prescribe it straight out of the box.  Good luck and stick with it."
