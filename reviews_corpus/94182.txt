"Have been taking this for a little over two months. Have gained 8 lbs and have excessive sweating and jaw clenching/teeth grinding. I am on 20 mg and my doctor has just lowered it to 10 to help with side effects. If it doesn&#039;t resolve side effects I will discuss discontinuing this. But I&#039;m not depressed just hypo manic a lot."
