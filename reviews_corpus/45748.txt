"Prescribed Prozac 20 mgs in 1988. In three days I felt much better. Tried several times to reduce dosage, but could not stay with lower dosage. I have been on 20 mgs ever since. It gave me back my life. In 1955, I was hospitalized and given electric shock treatments for a month. Then the depression returned in 1982(same year of menopause). My psychiatrist prescribed Elavil, then Palimor, and then Prozac. I am now 81 and take the same dosage. Still enjoying husband of 63 years, children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. Thank God, he sent Prozac."
