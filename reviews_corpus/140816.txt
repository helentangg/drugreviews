"I&#039;ve been reading these reviews over and over since January when I first got prescribed escitalopram and I only actually started taking them 4 weeks ago when my anxiety had gotten so bad I couldn&#039;t leave the house to take my children to school. 
I was terrified of the side effects and to be honest the first 3 weeks they were frigging awful. But I was determined that this drug will work and I ploughed my way through it,  my anxiety got worse but now I&#039;ve hit week 4, it is working. I&#039;m leaving the house again (been out 5 times last week compared to 5 times in 2 months when I wasn&#039;t on medication). 
Listen to me, if you are so fed up of having no life, give this medication at least 4 weeks. It&#039;s worth the wait."
