"Please talk to your PHARMACIST and let him know what other medications you are taking if you are ever prescribed this medication. I was prescribed this medication for severe neurological pain but my doctor either ignored or overlooked the fact that I was also taking a medication for migraines and I had a very bad interaction between the two medications which led to what I would call bad rage."
