"I have been taking Lexapro for 3 months now and feel great. I had severe anxiety. Now I feel like myself and can think clearly. If I get angry I only feel that way for a few minutes instead of a few days. I experienced a few side effects like dry mouth, and restlesness but those symptoms have faded. The worst side effect I have is loss of appetite. I don&#039;t mind that one so much."
