"I suffer from major depression so the doctor gave me Cymbalta. The first days I was completely out of it. Didn&#039;t know what was going on so I quit taking it for a day and I went back to normal. The next day I tried again to give it time, well I have no memory of two days because I was so out of it and blacked out. I woke up in the hospital swollen up like crazy they told me I overdosed from the depression medicines but I only took 4, 1 pill a day."
