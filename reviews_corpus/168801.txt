"Had been on Effexor XR for 5 years, and noticed as I progressed toward menopause, my depression was worsening.  I was just a shell of the person I was previously.  I went to my dr and was prescribed  Viibryd.  Within a week I noted some gradual changes.  It has been just short of a month, and I notice less sleepiness and concentration concerns.  I also have less anxiety, and my irritable bowel syndrome symptoms are lessening too.  So far I am very pleased with it."
