"I must say, I went to this very site and read such great reviews about this medication that I was sincerely relieved when my doctor told me that he recommended I try this medication out.  I cannot stress enough how HAPPY I have become over the past few weeks.  Panic attack free, full night sleep, good and positive energy (most of the time).  Celexa (citalopram) really has done a complete 180 for me.

My panic attacks typically consisted of shakes/tremors, tightness in my chest/throat, sweating, fast heartbeat, and a sleepless night.  Since day 1 of starting this medication, I&#039;ve been panic attack free.  Only side effects were occasional dry mouth and yawning for me .  Definitely recommend this medication!"
