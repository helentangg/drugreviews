"My MD prescribed Cymbalta for chronic pain caused by disc bulges, in addition to treating my previously diagnosed depression and anxiety.

I took my first dose around noon, and by 2pm had a pounding headache. As the day continued, I began to have tremors and convulsions, blurred vision and was very disoriented. At 10 pm my heart rate and breathing were very rapid and I had mild hallucinations. I rode it out for the rest of the night and after about 3 hours most of the side effects had faded with the exception of the headache. Unfortunately, the worst side effects was yet to come, graphic vivid nightmares. My doctor took me off the medication, after one dose, three days ago. "
