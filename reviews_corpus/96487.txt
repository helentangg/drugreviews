"I&#039;ve been on Zoloft for about a year.  Sure, my sex drive has decreased and my weight has increased, but I no longer feel like I&#039;m falling apart at the seams, and I&#039;m genuinely happy.  My doctor tried to increase my dose once, and I was so perky that I couldn&#039;t concentrate at work!  50mg is plenty for me!"
