"I have been diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety my whole life. I have been on multiple medicines to try to tame them, and nothing really worked... until now. I got on effexor and immediately felt relief of anxiety.  I hadn&#039;t felt like that since I was a very small child. It felt like the world was lifted off my shoulders! I couldn&#039;t believe the difference! I recommend this medicine to anyone who suffers with anxiety. I tthought all this time that how I was feeling was related to depression, but it wasn&#039;t!  It was anxiety. I love how I feel now and would love to be a spokeswoman for this medicine.  It made me feel so much better! Highly recommend to anyone."
