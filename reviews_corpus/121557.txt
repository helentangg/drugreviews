"I have cPTSD, serious depression, anxiety and I also suffer from Fibromyalgia.  I will never get off of Effexor, because it works and the withdrawal symptoms scare me to death.  I would only suggest  Effexor as a last resort and only for someone with long term issues because of the withdrawal problems.  Effexor is a lifetime commitment but it works so that&#039;s ok with me.  I did try other medications and honestly, the one thing I have learned to test if an antidepressant is going to work is if after a week of taking it whether there is sexual dysfunction or not.  I wish it helped me more with the Fibro but it is so worth it for the anti-anxiety.

I can buy 90 days of generic at Costco for under $40 and that is cheaper than my insurance copays"
