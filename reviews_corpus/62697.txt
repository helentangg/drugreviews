"Celexa worked great to curb my anxiety. No longer use Xanax at all. However, side effects are getting to me and I am thinking of switching. I am experiencing: extreme fatigue and yawning, weight gain, blurred vision. Doctor is talking about switching me to Effexor. I recommend Celexa highly to anyone."
