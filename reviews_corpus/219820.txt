"I&#039;m always super nervous about taking new meds. So before I do, I always check up online to see other&#039;s experience with it. I saw a lot of really negative stuff about amitriptyline. I have to say, I was happily surprised with the outcome.  I get really good, heavy sleep and even after the first dose I noticed less anxiety and a happier mood, which is only getting better day by day. This med, along with yoga, lots of meditation, calming teas, and a healthy diet can truly go a long way if you&#039;re sincerely dedicated. 10/10 from me. Good luck!"
