"I started taking this medicine about a month ago for depression.  My doctor gave me 2 weeks of free samples, 30mg, to try and I really liked it so he gave me a prescription, which was very expensive.  Another week went by and this past week I have felt mentally blaaaa, unmotivated to do anything, extremely tired and lazy-which is unlike me, and unsocial.  I realize that this could be the result of something else, but I stopped taking it yesterday just to see, especially after reading about the withdrawal symptoms.  I haven&#039;t noticed any withdrawal symptoms, and feel a bit less lazy, though it is soon to tell.  I also take 100mg of Lamictal."
