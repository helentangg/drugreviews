"I have taken almost every drug out there. With so many drugs/so many different side effects, because of this I have been off all drugs for a couple of years, I feel the need to go on something for depression. I was so worried about side effects of weight gain or hair loss, that I asked my doctor for something that would avoid these two side effects. I have been on Pristiq for almost 2 weeks...I have mild headaches, frequent urination, constipation, and insomnia so far. I am hoping with monitoring this that maybe if I change the time that I take it and try to add fiber to my diet, and try to drink less fluids closer to bed time to help. I have had worse side effects with other medicines, so I will stay on longer to see if I notice a difference."
