"Was on Lexapro back in 2009 and it helped me a lot. I had a lot of stress and minor depression. I went off it a few months after I started because I felt so good, and that was a bad idea. I recently started taking it again and as of right now I&#039;m going through some bad side effects. I normally don&#039;t feel bad at home but I&#039;m stressing out. Can&#039;t eat, have a minor headache and I&#039;m anxious as well. I hope this feeling ends soon."
