"The sickest six weeks of my life. Constant nausea accompanied by intermittent vomiting, headaches and flu-like symptoms.  I would have  had to die to feel better.  An emotional wreck, severe bouts of crying, feelings of utter despondency and hopelessness that were not present before taking.  I am amazed that this drug made it through the FDA with such high incidences of nausea.  Absolutely horrible experience."
