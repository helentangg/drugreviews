"This medicine helped me a lot at first, helped me get motivated to get out of bed, etc. Now I&#039;m extremely irritable and very snappy with my husband and daughter. I have also had some very bad fits of rage. I&#039;ve just put in a crisis call after I caught myself about to hurt my daughter. Cymbalta is not a medicine that is working for me after taking it for a little over a month."
