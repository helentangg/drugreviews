"Started having panic attacks last June when I had a medical issue with my eye. My doctor prescribed me celexa. I held onto the prescription for over 6 months as I was terrified of relying on a pill to help me and was scared of side effects. Finally I couldn&#039;t take the anxiety anymore and started on 10mg. First few weeks I COULD NOT SLEEP and my anxiety was worse. Had to take sleeping pills. But eventually it got better and now I feel great! It&#039;s been 6 months and I&#039;ve never increased my dosage. I still get anxious once in a while but that is fine with me because I don&#039;t want to &quot;not feel anything&quot; like some pills do to you! I know it&#039;s not for everyone but I am glad I finally tried it!!"
