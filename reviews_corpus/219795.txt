"I started taking 10mg of amitriptyline in December of 2015 when I was diagnosed with interstitial cystitis. It takes away the constant sharp burning pain I was having along with the constant urge to urinate. Once in a while I will have a flare up of symptoms but even then my pain is very minimal. The only side effects I&#039;ve noticed are that it makes me drowsy in the first few hours of taking my dose. The first month or two of taking I would experience extremely vivid nightmares, but those have subsided to simply being vivid dreams some of the time. I&#039;ve also noticed that if I forget to take it one night I have difficulty falling asleep, and some anxiety similar to the feeling of drinking a little too much coffee, which is tolerable."
