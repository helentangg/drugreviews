"I finally sought medical help for what I thought was a lifelong struggle with depression which ended up being more an anxiety disorder. I never thought I had anxiety- even though my mom and 2 sisters have anxiety disorders. I shut down, retreat, avoid, sleep- where they all become frantic. I thought I was have a heart attack one night (panic attack) and sought treatment a few weeks later. It&#039;s been about 4 months on lexapro and I realize for the first time I don&#039;t feel a general sense of dread. I actually answer the phone. I always thought it was just a funny quirk that I hated answering the phone but I now realize I was afraid. I&#039;m on 20mg and went through really rough anxiety at the outset- stick with it!! It&#039;s worth it."
