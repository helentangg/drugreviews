"I started taking Effexor about a year ago. Started on 75mg and went all the way to the maximum 375mg over a 6 month period. The side effects were really quite bad, thus had to cut back to 225mg, this dose works very well. Some doctors are quite quick to push up your doses if your progress is slow. My advice is give it plenty of time before increasing doses. More isnt always better. Effexor is a good drug just somtimes can be a little slow working, the withdrawal from cutting down tablets wasn&#039;t really that bad at all; as long as you take it slow. Good luck to everyone who takes this drug."
