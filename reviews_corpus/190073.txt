"One of the best-responding antidepressants I&#039;ve ever taken. Unfortunately, I had to stop taking it because my resting heart rate went up to &ge; 100 bpm while on this medication (could&#039;ve been interacting adversely with my Dexedrine). But wow, what a response I had! It started responding just a few weeks after increasing it to 75 mg, and it seemed to really bring me out of my cocoon at 100 mg-125 mg. That was the highest I ever got to try before realizing what was going on with my heart, and subsequently having to back down on the dosage. My positive response diminished, and I had gained a bunch of weight anyway, so we decided to switch meds."
