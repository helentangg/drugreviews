"I absolutely hated this whole ordeal I have been through. I will start by saying everyone is different and if you are doing great on this medication then I am happy for you. I did not fair as well. It first started with the anger. I am normally not at all angry (I suffer from anxiety and panic disorder mainly) so freaking out about the tiniest things are not me. But I wanted to give it the full 6 weeks so I carried on. Next was the Tinnitus. It was in both ears about once or twice a day (as a 25 year old female this was not normal for me), but again I carried on. Then the horrid anxiety and panic attacks came and didn&#039;t go away. Then I woke up with horrid muscle aches and almost convulsion like tremors. Went to ER and was told to stop meds."
