"Lexapro is amazing!  I started out on 10 mg because of my anxiety.  It worked great.  I was bumped up to 20 mg and I feel FANTASTIC.  I have never been so happy.  I am no longer irritable and I feel hope in my life.  The only bad side effect is the sleepiness. By about 3 in the afternoon I am ready to fall asleep.  I also have to make sure I eat before I take it or else my stomach gets upset.  Not bad costs for the price of being HAPPY."
