"40 mg for 1 yr and 4 months. Remain on low dose clonazepam , and Ambien for sleep. Add weekly DBT group, counseling and exercise. Medication has helped reduce anxiety to manageable/tolerable levels. Diarrhea for couple weeks at first, libido killer, erection possible, orgasm takes effort/hours. Daily dosing schedule needs to be adhered to or you will feel it. Can cause sleeplessness. I&#039;m not nearly as anxious, but often feel blunted and/or detached. 20 yr love/hate history with SSRI&#039;s and SNRI&#039;s...dread both going on them and coming off but they do level out the emotions. Sexual side effects for me/partner are a bummer. Insurance made sure at least two other SSRIs tried first."
