"I suffer from medical anxiety.  I first tried Paxil - itched like crazy.  Then lexapro - shook all the time.  Cymbalta has changed my life.  I feel so much better now, and almost back to &#039;normal&#039; after 5 weeks on the medication.  I have a little insomnia, and have lost a few pounds, but other than that I feel like I&#039;m 30 again, instead of 50!"
