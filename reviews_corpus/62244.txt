"I started this medication a year after my sibling passed away. Whether the death of my sibling caused my anxiety/depression..I&#039;m not sure. But I have now been on this medication for four months and have noticed a change. It feels as though a weight has been lifted from my shoulders. I used to have this constant fear every day and that has minimized. I&#039;m not 100 percent, but I can tell this medication is working for me. The only side effect I&#039;ve noticed is drowsiness. I started taking it at night rather than in the morning and I have felt so much better."
