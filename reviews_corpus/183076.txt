"I had been using Cymbalta for 3 years and all was great until the generic one appeared and I took it for several weeks and started getting a metallic taste in my mouth and got cyst in my mouth and on both sides of my tongue; nothing tasted right.  I had my doc write a script for use of only the original Cymbalta because I saw on another forum that this was a reaction of the generic.  All the cyst cleared up and gone and everything is normal after 2 weeks of original Cymbalta!"
