"I was on Prozac and it wasn&#039;t working anymore. I tried Pristiq and for the first couple of weeks I didn&#039;t feel &quot;right&quot;. Then, I started feeling much better. I also take a prescribed supplement called Deplin because my body doesn&#039;t absorb folic acid- a source of my depression. I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s the Deplin, the Pristiq or both, but I don&#039;t get depressed anymore. I do get kind of &quot;mean&quot; when I drink coffee with it. My sex drive is loooooow and achieving orgasm is difficult. I also suffer from dry mouth at night. But, I&#039;m here to rate the medication on how well it helped my depression and it helped so very much. It&#039;s expensive, even with insurance."
