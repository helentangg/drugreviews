"After I gave birth to my son (eight years ago) I began having major depression. I have tried everything. I went to a new doctor because the other one just kept adding more medicines. I was on wellburtin, serzone, prozac, cymbalta, seroquel,ativan,and celexa. So I tappered off everything except for seroquel to help me sleep. I only need ativan once in a while now, all because she put me on lexapro 20mg. This drug started working within 3 days for my anxiety. It does make me tired so I take it at 4pm and sometimes I don&#039;t even need my seroquel. I love this drug! I can&#039;t believe I didnt try this sooner."
