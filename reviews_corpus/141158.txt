"I started this for some severe anxiety due to a phobia (flying). I went from having a constant &quot;adrenaline&quot; kick feeling (all day every day), occasional difficulty breathing and some crying to now very calm and relaxed. This has been amazing. It did make me feel very sleepy and yawning a lot when I started it, but I would say about 2 1/2 weeks in that went away. improvements in my anxiety were noticeable within about 3 days. no drugged up feeling.. just much calmer. working for me really well."
