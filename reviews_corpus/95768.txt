"It&#039;s been really amazing. I&#039;m on 50mg daily of Zoloft and I went from horrible frequent panic attacks to occasional, &quot;normal&quot; anxiety. I feel like my life is totally different to how it was a year ago (I wouldn&#039;t even leave the house for fear of panic attacks). I switched from Lexapro which was not nearly as effective."
