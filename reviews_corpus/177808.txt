"I have taken several depression medicines over the last six years.  All with limited results.  My entire body started hurting so bad, fatigue, headaches and broken sleep at night.  I begged my doctor trying me on Cymbalta because it helped a friend with similar symptoms.  My pain was almost gone in a week and completely gone in two.  I never realized how bad my pain was until it was gone!  I take it at night because I get very sleepy within a few hours. I sleep great and wake up pain free and fully rested.  It has helped my depression but not to the extent it has taken away all my pain.  I did feel slightly nauseous on and off for a few weeks.  My appetite has diminished which has helped me lose 10 pounds."
