"Causes extreme drowsiness.  Can sleep anywhere and any time.  Tough to do any driving of over an hour or two.  Slowed metabolism and resulting weight gain.  Motivation is gone.  Just want to sit around and do nothing.  Erectile dysfunction is also a problem but addressed with other very expensive drugs."
