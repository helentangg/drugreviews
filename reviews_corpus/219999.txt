"Had a very bad experience with anxiety three years ago..couldn&#039;t eat or sleep properly..feeling nauseous..diarrhoea every morning. Tried lexapro for 3 nights but made diarrhoea worse. Started on 10mg of amitriptyline each night..symptoms improved for a week and then started to come back. Went on 25mg every night and have been taking it ever since. Would not like to stop taking it now as I feel so much happier in myself..side effects were a dry mouth for about a week but nothing after that.."
