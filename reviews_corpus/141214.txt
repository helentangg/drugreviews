"For the past year and a half I have been suffering from GAD. It started off as minor hypochondria and slowly festered into major anxiety attacks and physical symptoms. Mostly at night my heart would race, I would get brain zaps and numbing in my arms. I would panic and thought I was dying. Occasionally I could calm myself down but sleeping was almost non existent. For the longest time I refused to see my dr about it. I didn&#039;t want to admit I had a problem. And no way did I have a condition that needed to be medicated!! Not me! Finally my husband called my Dr and set me up an apt. I am so thankful he did.I saw my dr and she reassured me that I&#039;m normal. She prescribed me 10mg of lexapro and it had made a WORLD of difference.I highly reccomend"
