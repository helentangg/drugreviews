"I have been on Amitriptyline 75mg for a year and a half. It does amazing things for depression and even pain. I was suicidal everyday until I was prescribed this medicine. I have had only one side affect. Dry mouth! The dry mouth is terrible. I carry gum with me always lol. I recommend this medicine to ANYONE with depression, nerve pain, and insomnia. It will change your life for the better! I promise you! Give it a try!"
