"I have had PTSD for many years, tried zoloft 200mg, seroquel 700mg, lexam 20mg and now pristiq 200mg. It is working although I lack motivation, but it is slowly returning. I can state categorically that pristiq does not mix with alcohol. If you take meds that affect the brain so deeply, alcohol will screw up the process for days.  I wish you all wellness on your journey to betterment.  Be kind to yourself, accept help and take care."
