"I&#039;ve recently started taking prozac and have never been on an ssri before but have always thought I needed one for my constant worrying thoughts and random depression. I haven&#039;t been taking it for very long and already feel like a weight has been lifted. I feel happier and it&#039;s easier to get rid of my bad thoughts that previously consumed my life. I feel better than I&#039;ve ever felt amd wish I would have tried it sooner!"
