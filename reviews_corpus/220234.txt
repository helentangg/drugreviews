"Was getting head aches/migraines 4-5 times a week started this pill at 10mg and head aches went down to 1-2 a month and very mild. Amazing pill.. life changing for me! Be careful if you change your dose.. went up to 20mg a day and headaches came back so now back at 10mg and so far so good! Amazing amazing amazing!"
