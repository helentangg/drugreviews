"I&#039;ve been taking Sertraline for 5 days now, and they have been the craziest tablets I&#039;ve taken. I have severe anxiety, ocd and the doctors aren&#039;t sure weather I have a personality disorder also. Within hours of taking these tablets for the first time they gave me chronic diarrhoea, it gave me little aches and pains everywhere and I felt very irritable. I felt like I had taken something illegal it was horrible! But I&#039;ve read so many times to wait it out and you will feel better. and I have! I realised yesterday how calm I am around people now (usually I&#039;m seriously on edge and can&#039;t calm down due to the fact that the table isn&#039;t inline with the sofa haha) but its stopped me from noticing these things so much, I think I need to hold out the symptoms."
