"I suffered with chronic pain for about seven years.  Went to many specialist who told me either nothing was wrong or I had fibromyalgia.  I tried all medications out there for pain, muscle relaxers, anti-depressants and medication for epilepsy.  As well as meds for fibro.   Nothing helped.  Finally I found a new Nerologist who put me on a combo of Amitriptyline and Prozac.  I am on both the smallest doses.  It has been a miracle for my pain.  I wish I would have known about this 7 years ago.  My biggest problem with it is weight gain like 13 pounds.  My diet has not changed and I took up running.  But no weight comes off.  I guess I rather have less pain and be a little over weight then skinny and in tons of pain:)"
