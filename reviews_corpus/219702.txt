"I&#039;ve suffered from cluster tension headaches and migraines for years. My doctor prescribed me different kinds of things to deal with the pain, tramadol, codeine, diazepam and shots of voltaren, diclofenac and various other muscle relaxants.He then referred me to a psychiatrist to see if there was another cause for my headaches, as I suffer from serious anxiety problems.  The psych. thought it would be a good idea to run me through a gauntlet of antidepressants (sertraline, and venlafaxine to name a couple) none of which helped.  He then tried me on Amitriptyline, which didn&#039;t really help me, but did make me gain weight, and feel extremely nauseous. Mirtazipine has helped me a lot better used with Temazepam at night and Clonazepam in the day"
