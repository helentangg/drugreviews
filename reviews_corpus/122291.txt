"I have tried what seems like every medicine for my depression and have only experience temporary minor relief of symptoms.  My psychiatrist wanted to try ECT because nothing else was working and I was tired of being in the hospital, but I refused.  She then mentioned that MAOIs(monoamine oxidase inhibitors) can sometimes be helpful for those who don&#039;t respond to other medicines so I agreed to try it. It has been a miracle worker for me! I have been on it for about 10 months and I have not had any severe depressive episodes and find myself going through the day without all of the terrible thoughts and cravings that used to haunt me.  I went from extremely suicidal to functioning normally.  I didn&#039;t even know I could feel this way!"
