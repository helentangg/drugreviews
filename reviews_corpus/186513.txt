"I have been taking Pristiq for just over a month now and I have to say it is amazing. I was experiencing severe depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts. After only 5 days of being on it I felt completely back to my old self again. I cannot believe how fast it works. I am able to function normally at work, concentrate and have extremely high amounts of energy. I take mine in the evening and I find that I am staying up longer than normal. It is hard for me to fall asleep. I think I might switch to the mornings instead. Otherwise no major side effects...a few headaches in the first 2 weeks but they are gone now. Have a few hot flashes and night sweats from time to time. This medicine has helped me and I truly hope it helps you too. I feel GREAT."
