"I tried Prozac, Paxil, Cymbalta and Lexapro before I was put on Pristiq. The Lexapro helped but left me a sexual zombie. So my psychiatrist started me on 50 mg of Pristiq. Within days the sexual interest and feelings returned. After two weeks, she upped it to 100 mg and I&#039;ve not had to take any anxiety medicines. 
Negatives: Nausea, upset stomach. Very vivid and sometimes very frightening dreams. A lot of tossing and turning. Fortunately, I have a very patient and loving partner who has been with me through all these months of depression. I will say that the medicine has made me much more positive and outgoing, and it is amazing how other people respond."
