"I&#039;ve been on lexapro for five days now and I&#039;ve never felt more anxious in my life, I haven&#039;t been eating and when I do eat nothing stays in my stomach long, my sleeping has been a nightmare, maybe 5 hours a night if I&#039;m lucky, and I&#039;m shaky all through the night and partially through the day, I feel like I&#039;m going crazy but I keep reading reviews that side effects are awful then subside and the medication is great, I&#039;m just really feeling like I&#039;m losing it here"
