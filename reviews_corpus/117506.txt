"I am 28 years old male and veterinary special student in the field of avian diseases at tehran university . I have been diagnosed as IBS(diarrhea dominant &amp; abdominal pain) in 2008. IBS bothered me always and disturbed my private life until my gastroentrologist and psychiatrist prescribed drugs of nortriptyline 10 mg (at least  remedible dosage of this drug)  at once a day and before bedtime and dicyclomine 10 mg drug at twice to three times in day and  at least twenty minutes before food meal and I felt a good and normal life after administration these drugs in during of 1 week. I believed this drug  has positive  and considerable effects on IBS treatment but no cure however this drug had some side effects and adverse like all other drugs"
