"Effexor has had an absolutely amazing impact on my life. I have Major Depression Disorder - I have Anxiety, fun mix! I started off on 75mg and after a couple of months went to 150. Been at 150mg for close to 6 months and I am an entirely different person. My relationships have improved ten fold because I am no longer moody, irrational and I can feel emotions other than hopelessness and indescribable sadness. With that said - I am pretty certain I will never be able to come off this medication. I recently had to go 5 days without my Effexor and it was literally hell. First 2 days, I thought it was the flu - by day 5, I was ready to end it all. 3 days back on and I am golden. Oh plus it makes my pupils HUGE. Like I worry people think I am high."
