"Started on 5mg then moved up by 5 each month, currently on 15mg moving to 20 next week. I call this my miracle pill! First 5 days were hellish, worsened anxiety, headaches, tiredness, jaw clenching and just feeling out of it. But please stick it out! It&#039;s so worth it. I feel better than I have in years. I could hardly leave my house. Now I&#039;ve done more in the past few weeks than I have in a year! Only reason I didn&#039;t rate it 10 is because I&#039;m still not on recommended dose and still have a way to go. But all in all this has helped me so much. I&#039;m a better person on this medication. Please try it. You don&#039;t have to suffer."
