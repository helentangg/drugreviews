"I have my life back.

I became incapable of normal day to day life through a combination of major depression and anxiety. I almost lost my relationship, my future - my life. 

I was first put on fluoxotine with  another medication  and CBT by a useless dr. I opened my mind to try again which was brave after my first fail, and look at me now giving myself a pat on the back! 

I am so excited to start the rest of my life with this new and hopeful outlook!! I am on 50mg and the side effect for the first 2 weeks were well worth pushing through. 

Goodluck and stay openminded everyone! It does get better and there is a way out of the dark! %u263A"
