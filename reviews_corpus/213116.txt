"I think I was depressed when I was born. Had tried many antidepressants, but none worked even half as well as Nardil. I was on Nardil for 20 years until I was forced to come off of it by a psychiatrist, and cold turkey at that. That&#039;s been almost 2 years ago and I&#039;ve not been the same since."
