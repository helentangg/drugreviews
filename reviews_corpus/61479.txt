"I went on Celexa after three years of getting more and more depressed and my anxiety beginning to make it difficult to be at social events or function from day to day. I gave in to Celexa after hitting a low that I cannot explain. I couldn&#039;t get out of bed and I determined my life was worthless.  
I started on 10mg. The first two weeks were bizarre. Headaches, nausea and diarrhea. The anxiety seemed worse. But after 3-4 weeks it&#039;s like an ugly cloud lifted and I feel like I have my life back. I upped it to 20mg and I&#039;m staying at 20mg. I never worry about anything - which seems nuts. How can I not worry? I&#039;m unemployed, single, no kids, (I&#039;m 48) yet I feel like everything is okay, and I can move forward on achieving my goals."
