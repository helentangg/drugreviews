"I was on Sertraline for around one and a half years, with a maximum dose of 150mg.  It definitely did work in treating the depression. It leveled me out. I felt less fragile. It&#039;s difficult to describe, but if depression is an empty, hollow feeling, sertraline filled that up. There was no more of the constant sadness I had experienced before. 
The downsides were: blunted emotions. It became difficult to cry, and I didn&#039;t &quot;feel&quot; laughter. Altered sleeping. My dreams were more vivid and I occasionally woke up with my heart pounding. Sexual side-effects. Sensitive areas were numbed (not totally) and orgasm became difficult. Unpleasant withdrawal. Dizziness, nausea."
