"Diagnosed depressed, started 20mg Fluoxetine. After 1 year tried to come off. Met with anxiety &amp; deep depression. Doc told me it was old symptoms returning &amp; to get back on the meds. Over next 2 years tried twice more to come off the tablets &amp; was met with the same symptoms but more intense. Finally decided to withdraw from the medication, removing 1 tablet a week. After approximately 6 weeks I had crippling depression and suicidal thoughts, these would last for about 2 weeks before I felt ok. This continued for 10 months until I had completely weened off the meds. Now I am LEFT WITH panic disorder. The doctor had stated there are no withdrawl symptoms, which research is now showing there are which include depression and severe anxiety."
