"I suffered for about 2 yrs with fibromyagia. With in the first 2 days at 20mg I felt a significant decrease in the electrifying buzzing throughout my body. I finally got comfortable enough to get a good night of sleep.  The first day I had eye pain but it went away later in the day. Currently I wake up in the morning with a little nausea and my fingers swell but this too subsides throughout the day. Overall I have been more active and alert than I could ever remember. :)"
