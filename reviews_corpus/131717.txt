"After dealing with social anxiety every day, avoiding situations, and constantly being tense I decided that medication was the choice for me.
Effexor is the second drug I have tried. This medication has improved my social anxiety in a way that I never thought was possible. I enjoy talking with people and can&#039;t believe almost all of my anxiety has vanished. I have read that Effexor can be a slight stimulant, and I do notice this is a big reason I am more talkative and confident.
NEGATIVES: My memory is way worse than it&#039;s ever been. I do not concentrate well when people are speaking and retaining the information is difficult. My worries are gone, but so are my thoughts about everything. Feel foggy. No other side effects"
