"All I can add is all I want to do is sleep!!!   Nausea and diarrhea and general feeling of being sleep walking thru the day.  Hard time concentrating not sure how I&#039;m going to be able to find work since I don&#039;t feel like doing anything.   But at least I&#039;m calm snd feel things will get better.   Now to just wake up."
