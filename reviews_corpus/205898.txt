"Killed my sex drive (the only remainder of my life without fibromyalgia) and gave me terrible dry mouth that did not go away as my doctor said it would.  After six months of dry mouth and no libido, along with no symptom relief, I said enough was enough and quit cold turkey.  I experienced no withdrawal effects, and thankfully both the dry mouth and lack of sex drive went away soon thereafter.  

I feel like this medication made me more depressed by decreasing my already low quality of life.  It also made me feel as though my emotions were non-existent, which some may view as a good thing, but I prefer to be able to feel and experience emotions."
