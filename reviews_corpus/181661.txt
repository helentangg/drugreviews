"I have been taking Prozac for a little over a year. I started out taking 20mgs then, switched to 40mgs 2 months after I starting taking it. It helped me with the feelings of worthlessness, feeling like a failure and my thoughts of taking myself out of the pain. I finally saw a mental health Dr who diagnosed me with severe depression and increased my dosage to 60 mgs a day. I feel much better and the little things don&#039;t send me over the edge like they used to. I do have side effects such as dry mouth, always tired, increased/decreased appetite and recently diagnosed with lichenoid dermatitis. My Dermatologist is encouraging my dr to change my psych meds. I am unsure on that; the Prozac has helped me to want to live."
