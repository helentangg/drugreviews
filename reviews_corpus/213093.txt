"Diagnosed bipolar late 30&#039;s, lithium threw me into a clinical depression.  Was not hospitalized as I tried tricyclic after tricyclic, with the awful side effects, weight gain and almost a zombie, sleeping all the time.

Researching I discovered MAOI Inhibitors, was put on Nardil.  Had only 15 min. medication checks every two weeks.  At the first I asked, still depressed, &quot;Will I ever be motivated again?&quot;, so weary was I of this horrid depression.

At the second medication check, two weeks later, my depression had lifted!  It kept me out of depression, functioning, and as close to &#039;normal&#039;, &quot;whatever that is&quot;, for decades.  It saved my life."
