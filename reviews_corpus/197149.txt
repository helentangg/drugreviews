"The only reason I am giving this medication a &#039;9&#039; is because I&#039;m my 5th week in and I&#039;ve feel better than I did before taking the medication. I would say in my 3rd to 4th week I started feeling better and to my old self. Don&#039;t get me wrong...I still had moments of anxiety and stress, but nothing like it used to be. Recently, I&#039;ve been preparing for a CT Scan and I think it&#039;s caused my anxiety to spike again. I&#039;m staying positive and trying to face the reality that my worry is the cause of the anxiety. I know the full effect with Paxil doesn&#039;t kick in until 3 months and I am going to stay on it to benefit from it. Like I said, it&#039;s been a tremendous blessing, but still got a hill to climb. It&#039;s most important to face our problems head-on."
