"I started taking Elavil at the onset of my Fibromyalgia in 1997, had great sleep and was able to continue my work and study without pain.  In early 2010 I read the side effects of the medicine and recognized what was happening to me.  I had been falling for no reason, broke an ankle, lumbar vertebrate, thumb and many bruises.  I had dry mouth so bad could hardly talk, could not remember my words I wanted to say, and lost all sex drive.  I slowly removed myself off of the Elavil with the help of my doctor.  I have had lots of pain since February 2010 and cannot find a medicine to help me with my sleep and pain, but I will not use Elavil again.  I have not fallen, lost my memory or had any other side effects of this medicine since."
