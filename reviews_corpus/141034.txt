"I&#039;m a 26 yo female who has had anxiety for the last 2 years.  several attacks landed me in the ER.  I have been taking ativan but recently I&#039;ve had to take it almost every day just to feel normal.  Dr. put me on lexapro generic (10mg) 5 days ago. The first 3 days were the worst - I thought I was dying. I  saw the doctor again after that first 3 days and got him to reduce my dosage to 5mg.  I still take ativan because it hasn&#039;t had enough time to work completely I guess, but I&#039;m glad to finally feel like a person again.  Dr. also told me part of my anxiety is caused by bad sleep patterns (I get maybe 5 restful hours - not tossing and turning - each night).  I bought a new bed so hopefully it will do the trick.  I definitely felt great this morning!"
