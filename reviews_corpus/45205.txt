"It&#039;s only day 3 on Prozac for severe depression and anxiety. First day, I was only tired and couldn&#039;t think straight (had trouble finding the right words) but my family helped by laughing it off and going along with me when I&#039;d use the wrong word. 
Day 2, tired, nauseous and foggy. It feels like I&#039;m not in my skin, but watching life as a movie. 
Today is day 3 and while I haven&#039;t cried today, I&#039;m just exhausted, sad and not hungry. I pray this gets better after a couple of weeks. 
It&#039;s strange because even though I&#039;m exhausted, it&#039;s hard to sleep at times. I&#039;m hopeful this will work. 
 
I&#039;ll try to come give updates."
