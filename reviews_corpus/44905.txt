"My Dr told me to take this to ease premenstrual syndrome - one week before my period - the second time I used it I felt very strange - I couldn&#039;t stop crying I called my Dr and  broke down in her office. Before this I had not spoken more then a few sentences to her,  she got upset with me and  told me to see a shrink who put me on Prozac 3 weeks of use and  I had a manic episode and was informed I had become chemically bi polar and that SSRIs can cause this to happen.  It took 2 years to feel ok again"
