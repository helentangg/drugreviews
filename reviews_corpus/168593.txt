"I&#039;ve tried quite a few antidepressant meds over the last 20 or so years and this one is the worst.  I&#039;ve had nausea, bad abdominal pains, bloating, diarrhea, and intensified anger and rage.  After the first week I contacted my Physician&#039;s office because I was feeling worse. The nurse contacted me back and said the doctor wanted me to continue the medication because I hadn&#039;t been on it long enough. I&#039;ve been out on it for almost a month now and I&#039;m getting off of this trash. This stuff shouldn&#039;t even be on the market."
