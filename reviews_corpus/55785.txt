"I am a 60 year old male who has suffered with depression and panic attacks. In my late 30s, I decided to seek help.  Like many others, the list of medications my doctors tried would fill a dictionary.  Some worked for a while.  I refused to take Lithium.  In my late 40s, I was also diagnosed with ADD.

I now use 4 medications successfully: Effexor XR 450 mg daily, Xanax 1 mg daily, Adderall XR 60 mg daily, and Strattera 25 mg daily.

I am now free of both depression and panic attacks for nearly 10 years!  I am comfortable in public speaking and find that I love the adrenalin-rush!

I&#039;ve tried to stop using Effexor XR but always restarted because of the horrible depression.  Withdrawal is like a bad acid trip.  Use Effexor to stay alive!"
