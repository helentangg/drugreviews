"I was so low I tried diazepam then they wouldn&#039;t give me them so I tried paroxetine ....I cant do without them or I go back to that place to quick ....I don&#039;t like the drug me instead of just me but apparently everybody else thinks different I thought I was alright ....been on them 8 months nearly and don&#039;t feel like I even take any they are like tik tacs lol might up to 20mg they are good though I have a bad thought and this paroxetine jumps in with a good one anybody else notice that or am I crazy lol"
