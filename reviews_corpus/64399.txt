"I was 18 when I first realized I had anxiety. I thought I was just stressed out until it got so bad that it led me to panic attacks . Long story short I went to a naturopath due to horrifying stories about Zoloft and tried the herbal route (I used 5htp and skullcap). Unfortunately they were not strong enough for the severe anxiety I had endured while I started my first year in college. My normal Doctor and family eventually convinced me to go on Zoloft and I couldn&#039;t be more thankful they did. Within two weeks, I noticed improvement. Lessening anxiety, happier mood, energy, I was just me again. I started on 12.5 mg then went to 25 mg then to the average therapeutic dose at 50 mg. I&#039;vebeen on 50 mg for almost two years now.couldnt be happier"
