"Well I&#039;ve been off and on of zoloft and when I&#039;m taking it my friends notice a very big difference. They say that I&#039;m always a lot happier and more of a go getter. I just wish I would of been using it when my ex-fiancee was living here with me because well we&#039;d probably still be getting married. As for side effect&#039;s I haven&#039;t seen really any at all, I still have a very high sex drive, I still eat like normal, and I&#039;m a lot happier during high stress situations being in the military. But I&#039;ve been taking 25mg a day in the morning and it help&#039;s tremendously. But like people say on here you just have to take it and see if it&#039;s for you or not. Hope this review helps everyone out."
