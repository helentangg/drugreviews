"Stick it out. I was so hesitant to explore perscription medication, instead of the more natural methods. Eventually when I couldn&#039;t take it anymore I began Zoloft. The first month I was taking 50mg, and was slowly upped to 100mg. The side effects I experienced were really terrible- increased anxiety for a few weeks... and I crapped my pants... but I promise, it was worth it. Now I&#039;m 6 months on Zoloft and I don&#039;t suffer from social anxiety at nearly the same level as before. I feel much more confident speaking in front of groups and just being myself. I also feel less depressed. I think that people often experience the terrible side effects and give up on the drug, but if you&#039;re willing to suffer through, sertraline may really help you."
