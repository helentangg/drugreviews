"I have been on Zoloft for almost 5 months and I can honestly say it has saved me and and made my life brighter in so many ways. I was really struggling with GAD and panic attacks for about 3 years before I began and was struggling to cope, which felt very isolating. Zoloft has made me more feel more at ease, I feel more productive and motivated every day and far less irritated and impatient, to just name a couple of the benefits. I wish I hadn&#039;t waited so long to start (I was afraid of side effects), but I&#039;m happy to say I&#039;m feeling so much better. The side effects are difficult, I won&#039;t lie, for me they lasted about a month. I mostly just felt tired and spaced out and not very hungry. They do disappear however and it&#039;s so worth it."
