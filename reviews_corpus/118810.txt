"Two weeks of digestive symptoms, and six weeks of not being able to orgasm, but then this medicine kicked in and I felt almost normal again.  All the side effects went away.  I started at 50 mg and never went up.  My anxiety had settled down to where I could talk myself through it or ignore it. I am so grateful Zoloft was the first medicine I tried, and that it worked so well.

I had a history of migraines, three or four a year, some so severe they lasted for weeks and/or sent me to the ER, and I haven&#039;t had a single migraine in the year I&#039;ve been on Zoloft.  SSRIs are not supposed to prevent migraines, but it sure seems like my issues were related."
