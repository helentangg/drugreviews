"Wow, this drug has really changed my life. Some time after being diagnosed with GAD, I was prescribed 10mg of Lexapro just over a year ago, at age 16, and since have made a staggering recovery.

Before starting a medication regimen, I had very severe anxiety. Therapy had never really worked for me, But escitalopram turned out to be exactly what I needed. As my therapist put it, medication is a strong foothold so that you can pull yourself out of mental illness. It won&#039;t save you, but it will help you extremely.

I do get brain zaps if I forget to take this for one or two nights-- but that&#039;s the only lasting side effect I can think of. Overall great medication."
