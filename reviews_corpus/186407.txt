"I am a 31 year old male and have been on Pristiq a week. It is too early to tell but so far it is amazing. It has removed that &quot;barrier&quot; that kept me from feeling happiness and I now feel like I am driving with my &quot;bright lights&quot; on. I also have Adult ADHD and I can focus much better on tasks at hand. I also enjoy my job for the first time in years and don&#039;t leave work angry everyday. The only side effect that I have experienced is that it takes me longer to climax during sex, which really wouldn&#039;t be considered a problem. I hope this medicine continues to work and I will update as I am on it longer. My appetite has also decreased. So far nothing but thumbs up for Pristiq. This is the first out of 6 medicines that I have tried that I would recommend."
