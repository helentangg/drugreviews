"I am a women of 45 years old and have been going through menopause early.  In the past summer I started with anxiety, and terrible hot flushes which was effecting my life.  I went to my gp who referred me to the Jeans Hailles clinic.  Best thing I have ever done.  Due to my mother having severe osteoporosis and breast cancer in the past, HRT was out of the question.  The doctor suggested anti depressants.  I started taking venlafaxine about 4 months ago and the hot flushes has just about disappeared.  I have some side effects including yawning and worst of all a little constipated but all in all my confidence in myself has improved so much."
