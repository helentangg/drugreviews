"I took the lowest dose 10mg. The first two days were great I had zero anxiety and felt okay with no side effects but slight lightheadedness. The third day... I was putting on my make up just before work and all of the sudden my pupils got huge and my heart started beating a mile a minute. This calmed down but happened again five minutes later. It started happening every 3-5 minutes and then my chest, feet, and armpits started burning. I started having a panic attack because I was so afraid of what was happening. I couldn&#039;t see right anymore and I was very dizzy. On the way to the hospital I thought I was going to die. My side effects were so severe. This happened for two days after. Doc flushed it out of my system. Beware of this medication"
