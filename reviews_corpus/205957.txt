"I have been taking Pristiq for 3 months. Wonderful medication.  I feel great! The only side effect I have is so much night sweats I have to keep a second pajamas next to my bed because mine gets soaked. I was wondering if this side effect will get better. I am very reluctant to change this medicine because of this effect because other anti-depressants had the same effect and did not work as well."
