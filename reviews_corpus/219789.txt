"Have been prescribed Amitriptyline for sun damaged nerves on my scalp start with 10mg and I was so scared to take as don&#039;t want to become dependant on them. It has helped a little and Dr wants me to increase to 20mg. I&#039;m feeling good as sleeping better and overall feeling better but still worried of the dependency so haven&#039;t increased to 20mg."
