"I have always been an anxious person.  I have done okay with life&#039;s normal challenges, but the underlying anxiety was always there and I was constantly struggling against it.  I just lived with it.  If it got especially bad, I took Xanax or Ativan, but you can&#039;t use those long term.  Finally I let the doc prescribe sertraline.  (My husband had been set against it-he thought if I exercised more, all this would go away....but I couldn&#039;t exercise more....my anxiety made me tired all the time). Once I got past the first three weeks and started to see the difference, I was amazed.  No more repeating thoughts, mantras going around in my head, no more feeling lonely and like I have no friends, no more dread of simple things."
