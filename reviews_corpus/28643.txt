"I have never taken the time to actually write a comment on these types of things, but this is worthy of it. I had never dealt with anxiety until I became pregnant. I suffered with the worst anxiety and I was MISERABLE. I had panic attacks that sent me to the ER..I was too scared to drive, missed weeks of work and literally did not leave the house. I suffered through it until I had the baby. After, my doctor put me on Lexapro. After a few weeks, I felt 100% better. I can&#039;t begin to explain the change I had felt. I was able to do things without thinking the worst of everything. Before I started taking it, it depressed me because I thought I was going to feel that way forever and always have to deal with anxiety. Now, I live a normal life!"
