"I was previously on Paxil 30mg. I weaned myself off of it because I felt it wasn&#039;t working anymore, and also the weight gain was horrible. 25lbs in 6 months!! I was meds free for about a week before I decided I definitely need something. My depression and anxiety was creeping it&#039;s way back in, and I just felt horrible overall. Went back to the DR, and she gave me Prozac 20mg. My brain was already adjusted to SSRIs, so there wasn&#039;t much of a side effect period. Actually, I don&#039;t recall any side effects at all! But let me just tell you, Prozac (fluoxetine) is AMAZING! My depression and anxiety are gone!! I go outside so much more. This is the first time in my life I can ever remember waking up and thinking, &quot;What CAN I do today!&quot;"
