"This medicine truly changed my life. I was afraid to go outside, FaceTime family, and even talk on the phone. A few weeks after starting this medication I began to feel like myself again and I didn&#039;t even know I wasn&#039;t myself until I was able to do things like a normal human being again. I had previously tried Propranolol to make it so my heart rate wouldn&#039;t get super high but that wasn&#039;t solving the root of the problem. I am very thankful for Lexapro and I highly recommend it if you are suffering from generalized anxiety disorder like I was. I haven&#039;t had any side effects either :)"
