"I was prescribed 10mg amitryptiline for Endometriosis - for cramps I was getting that would radiate up my back. Coupled with surgery, amitryptiline has been life changing for me. I still have to take it around 7pm so I don&#039;t feel too groggy in the morning but I would rather have a good nights sleep and feel a bit tired in the morning than stay up all night in pain."
