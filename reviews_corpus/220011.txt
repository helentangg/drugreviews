"I&#039;ve been battling Gastrointestinal problems from day one, but for the last two years, I&#039;ve been suffering intolerable pain. two GP&#039;s and two gastroenerologists later I was still having problems with no clear diagnosis. Finally, I saw a new GP last week, that seemed to chalk my symptoms up to IBS, and she prescribed me this medication. I&#039;ve only been on 1/2 a 25mg pill each evening for five days, and already my symptoms have vastly improved. There&#039;s brief pain for about 10 minutes occasionally, but it passes quickly now and is far less severe, and I&#039;m not kept up all night by the pain anymore like before. No ill effects, as I take it in the evening about an hour before bedtime. This medication is a godsend for me!"
