"Hello people. 3 years ago when I was in med school, I experienced a terrible anxiety problem. It was a mixture of both, generalised anxiety disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder. I had issues attending classes, couldn&#039;t sleep at night with weeks of sleepless nights worrying and obsessing. And I decided to see a psychiatrist. He put me on 5mg lexapro and 2.5 mg diazepam daily taken at night. I was very compliant to treatment and saw a tremendous improvement in my mood with the OCD symptoms totally vanished in like 3 to 4 weeks. I was better able to handle my life and went on to complete medical school and managed to graduate as a doctor now. If it wasn&#039;t for lexapro, I don&#039;t think would have got this far in life."
