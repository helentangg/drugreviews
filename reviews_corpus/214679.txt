"I&#039;ve been on medicine for last 6 years and it is wonderful. It helped me to come out of MDD, anxiety and insomnia with bupron. No side effects observed. The state of despair I am nothing/failure, world is not worth living, every where negativity,unable to enjoy pleasure..etc feelings have gone. Escitalopram with SNRI like bupron/prestiq has given good results."
