"I personally WILL NEVER recommend Paxil to ANYONE. It literally ruined my life. At first, I felt that it was ok. But, quickly and suddenly, I started gaining weight. ALOT of weight. Literally, my pants fit one week and did not fix the next week. And that wasn&#039;t all. I was feeling much worse. I was very manic. So depressed that I could not get out of bed. My life was work, eat, and sleep. I had no motivation and I started fixating on thoughts of suicide. It wasn&#039;t until the unexplained rapid weight gain that I started to ask myself what had changed in my routine. That&#039;s when I realized that Paxil was the newest addition to my life and I began doing research.  I&#039;ve been off of it for about 2 months and I still can&#039;t lose the weight."
