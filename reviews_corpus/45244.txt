"This pill worked for me. I experienced tremendous weight loss. 216lbs to 204 in a month without trying. Happy every day. I can tell when the pill wears off because I get stressed. Pop a pill and 20 minutes later I can cope again. I have energy galore and I&#039;m motivated to do everything. Total change from the depressed me. I feel like I&#039;m myself again. A better me.  No side effects except excess energy. I have a harder time falling asleep because my mind races with things I can accomplish or work on."
