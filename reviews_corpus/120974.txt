"My experience with this was so horrible, made me feel worse, was always tired and so irritated, not to mention the headaches it gave me! 
I was always so hungry after taking the tablets, I was constantly eating and still didn&#039;t feel like I was full. Made me feel really achey and weak, I would not recommend this anti depressant to anybody!!!"
