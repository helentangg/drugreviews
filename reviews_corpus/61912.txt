"I&#039;ve been on celexa for 8 weeks. The first week at 10mg , next 2 weeks at 20mg and the last 5 weeks at 40mg.
I was suffering from debilitating severe depression. And I mean, I was suicidal by the time I went for help.
It took 6 weeks to feel better and by week 8 I feel amazing. No side effects except weight loss. 
I feel numb to pain now. But actually feel joy gratitude and love again. I enjoy things again. I don&#039;t cry 24-7 anymore , I can&#039;t cry even when I should be crying lol. It&#039;s a miracle drug. I didn&#039;t think anything could save me . Yes it took time and patience but am I ever glad I stuck it out. I have no intentions on going off this drug . Depression is rampant in my family , I refuse to ever go back to that scary dark place"
