"I&#039;ve had depression since my teenage years but never spoke to anyone about it and didn&#039;t take anything for it until 2 and a half years ago when I had a bad run of luck with a few big things close together, it all got too much and I took a massive amount of prescription medication to try and end my life, 16 hours later I was woken up by my mum and taken to hospital. The Drs said most people wouldn&#039;t of woken up or at least had severe organ damage but I was ok, no damage. That&#039;s when I had to speak to Drs, psychs, family and some friends. They put me on lexapro and it worked fairly well for 2 years but when a few bad, stressful situations happened again it failed the test, I&#039;m now trying venlafaxin, not sure yet but hopefully I get better results"
