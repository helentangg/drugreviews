"18, Female. Been taking this on and off for 8 months now. I cannot take it everyday even if I am prescribed to do so since the side effects are really taking a toll on my ability to function in everyday life. It made my depression worse. I can barely get out of bed due to fatigue from nausea and vomiting. And everytime I take this it is like the headache will stay with you 24/7 that it really becomes intolerable and frustrating. My doctor won&#039;t let me switch to another medication and she&#039;s really pushing this for me and it is so cruel since I feel so weak and I don&#039;t want to continue anymore. Taking it makes me want to die."
