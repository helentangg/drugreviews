"I&#039;ve tried lots of different medicines for depression. I&#039;ve been on Wellbutrin for about 6 years with success, added Effexor for anxiety; had a good few years. Then I went down hill, and have been trying many others since to find a good combination for me. I tried a few others without any good results, my psychiatrist had me try Viibryd. I felt a bit better for a few weeks at first, now I&#039;m not sure it&#039;s doing anything at all. I upped my Wellbutrin again and that made a little difference with my energy, but I&#039;m still just sad and depressed at all times. Now I have to try other medicines! Nice to know it worked for some."
