"Awful!!! Caused my anxiety to go into massive overdrive to the point my entire body was shivering. I did fall asleep at night because I was exhausted from being on edge all day. I put on 15 lbs since I started taking it 3 months ago. They are like speed pills which causes the excessive anxiety. So glad I&#039;m off of them now. Definitely not for me!
