"I was very unsteady on my feet, at first some of the pain was resolved, but it didn&#039;t work. Even though my feet were NOT swollen they felt that way, very tight feeling. It felt like I was walking on balloons, terrible feeling and I was afraid to walk with that unsteadiness. Didn&#039;t work for me, since then, I have been on many different medications. Neurontin, didn&#039;t help, amitriptiline, didn&#039;t help, Lyrica, didn&#039;t help. I am on nortriptyline now with a pain patch. The fentanyl patch really helps, but I don&#039;t want to stay on this forever, so trying different medications. I am only supposed to leave the pain patch on 3 days, and found with the new medication, nortriptyline, I can go 5 days. So I am hopeful here. "
