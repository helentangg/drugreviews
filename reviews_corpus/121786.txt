"I Began taking Effexor XR 150 to treat anxiety /Depression. The medication gave very few adverse reactions initially. I did notice benefits until the end of my second month. There was a mistake with supply and I had to go 2 days without. Within 2 days I was in Full on withdrawals. It Began with insomnia, liveable. Then came nausea, muscle cramps, hot \Cold sweats, hives, Swollen tongue, Irritability, Depression, HALLUCINATIONS... Those were the most significant ones. By the second day off my withdrawals were bad."
