"Munik....thank you so much for your review.  I was telling a friend that I was feeling anxious and irritable today and wasn&#039;t sure if my new medication (Pristiq) was for me.  It&#039;s been 2 weeks and thanks to your words of encouragement I&#039;m hanging in there.  I must say I have noticed a decrease in my appetite which is much needed and have felt like exercising for the first time in years."
