"My doctor prescribed Pristiq to help me deal with overwhelming grief after death of my son. I never took any antidepressants before, so I have nothing to compare it with. It worked very well for me, after taking it for just 3 days,without major side effects. I don&#039;t cry everyday like I used to, but also feel somewhat emotionally numb. I am calmer, happier and able to go on with my life."
