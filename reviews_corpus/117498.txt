"So far, so good. I&#039;ve been on medication for anxiety &amp; depression since Dec. 2000 &amp; after a few years it seems that the medication stops working. Newly dx&#039;d w/Epilepsy. Hence, the increase in anxiety &amp; depression. I will admit that I was having a really bad day &amp; out of desperation I took this (had it but never took it)--&amp; it squashed the anxiety. (I know clinically better)  Epilepsy &amp; Estrogen don&#039;t mix well. I&#039;m not thrilled w/another pill but so goes the old...&quot;do you want to be right or happy?&quot; I&#039;ll take the latter."
