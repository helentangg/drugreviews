"Well, I&#039;m a 23 going on 24 yr old alcoholic who always relapsed constantly due to not feeling good at all. Feeling weak, depressed, stress, major anxiety and drinking helped that. After my 3rd medical detox I was put on Prozac and didn&#039;t drink for over a year. It changed my life. Best year I ever had. Now it&#039;s 2011 and in February I had a relapse and have been struggling to get back on track this whole year. I realized that I can&#039;t handle life on lifes terms without being on my Prozac because I, the DR, and the nurse seen a big difference in me when I took it. I&#039;m already on my third day of taking it, which some might think to soon to tell. BUT, I&#039;m telling you I feel great, I feel worry-free, it changed my life and helps my sobriety."
