"The very first day I took Pristiq I had severe headaches and I never get headaches. I had diarrhea within the first hour that I took the pill. I couldn&#039;t finish my food because I haven&#039;t been feeling well, and I felt extremely dizzy. I haven&#039;t been taking it very long, but I&#039;ve been sick ever since I started taking the pill."
