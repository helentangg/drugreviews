"I would just like to say that these reviews can seem scary to someone. I thought the same after reading them. I decided to go ahead anyway with the citalopram. Started on 10mg then 20mg and now 40mg. These do make a great difference. In terms of side effects it wasn&#039;t bad for me. I found I was tired during the day and always kept yawning loads. Had odd sensation in my head for first few days. Apart from those symptoms I was fine."
