"I&#039;ve been taking Cymbalta for 2-3 months.  I had been taking 30 mg. a day, but my doctor told me I could try 60 mg.  a day, i.e. 30 mg. twice a day, and since I&#039;ve been taking 60 mg., which is about a month ago, something weird has happened: I feel ecstatic all the time, and as though I&#039;ve returned to my &quot;true&quot; self, i.e. ways I used to be, and liked, decades ago, but have been out of touch with for a long time. I&#039;m much more productive and creative, and don&#039;t feel overwhelmed the way I used to."
