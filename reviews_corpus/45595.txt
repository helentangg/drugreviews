"Prozac was not the medicine for me. I was put on Prozac for depression. I actually began to feel worse when I took it. I also developed a bad case of OCD taking Prozac to the point that I plucked my eyebrows completely off. I also felt very anxious all the time and scared. So my doctor took me off Prozac and switched me to Lexapro and it did wonders. I am a lot happier and confident now. I no longer have OCD and my eyebrows have since grown back. My advice to people who are not seeing results with Prozac is to switch to Lexapro. I wish I would have long ago. I haven&#039;t been this happy in years."
