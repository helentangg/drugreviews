"This has worked the best for me thus far.  I have been on several SEVERAL anti-depressants and by far this has been better with very little side effects.  Nausea has been the only downside at this point.  I missed two days due to my pharmacy being closed and didn&#039;t have the &quot;brain zaps&quot; after missing.  Big plus in my book."
