"Was switched to this after the generic version by ranbaxy was discontinued. Developed symptoms of tolerance straightaway. It causes my brain to scream out in pain all the time and I keep getting unwanted thoughts. I also developed muscular aches and pains all over and other drugs just kept causing my muscles to contract and be unable to relax. I tried stopping many times but kept returning cuz of the nausea and vomiting and all the other symptoms above. I have been off it for about three months and have been back on it for three days. Already I hear my brain screaming out in pain and the unwanted thoughts return. The muscle aches seem to occur only in conjunction with another drug. I am taking it only because of the grief I feel in my heart"
