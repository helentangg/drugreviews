"Minimal effectiveness for me.  Was on 10 mg for anxiety and depression for 8 months.  Had to reduce to 5 mg due to extreme fatigue and general malaise.  When my Dr. asked if it was helping I said I didn&#039;t know, other than it was making me tired and emotionless (not happy, not sad).  His reply was if you don&#039;t know then it&#039;s not doing anything, Good answer!  I tapered off over 2 months and withdrawal was hell.  Now am only taking clonazapam for anxiety and feel much better.
Tried it again for 1.5 weeks and only 5 mg (just to be sure) and had same extreme fatigue, blah blah blah feeling, and felt down and worthless.  Then withdrawal effects again after only such a short period.  This drug is not for me."
