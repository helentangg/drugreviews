"I had a very negative experience with this drug.  I had been on Effexor XR for years. My Doctor suggested switching to Pristiq which was supposed to be the replacement for Effexor when the patent ran out. I immediately had horrible migraines, agitation, uncontrollable feelings of anger. I called the doctor&#039;s office on the third day and was immediately taken off the drug. They said I was not the first person with those symptoms.  "
