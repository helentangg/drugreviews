"Personal experience:

1. Put up with the initial uncomfortable feelings of dizziness, increased anxiety, insomnia, lethargy,  (the anxiety is usually your fears related to taking medicine and the &#039;what ifs&#039;, medicine alone can not make you think bad things.

2. After 2 weeks (yes I was one of the unlucky few who had very bad side effects for all that time but I stuck with it) the therapeutic effects start coming through eventually 

3. Don&#039;t just assume medicine will make you completely happy, you still need to actively change your life to fix the root causes of anxiety or depression i.e do mediation, quit drinking, do CBT, take up exercise, see a therapist, be around people more."
