"I had been experiencing daily migraines for a couple of years. I had tried many things and then my rheumatologist put me on Nortriptyline. Within about 4 weeks the headaches were completely gone and I had my life back. I have been taking it for over 6 months now and haven&#039;t had one headache. Nortriptyline saved my sanity and made me think clearer than I had for years. I will not be stopping this any time soon."
