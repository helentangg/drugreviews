"I had been on Lexapro/Celexa/Citolopram for the past 10 years (maybe a couple more) and it was fabulous!  About a year and half ago it stopped working for me.  I had tried Wellbutrin before the L/C/C and it was horrible for me - like wanting to hide in a corner under a desk paranoia!  My doctor sugested Viibryd after the L/C/C stopped working and so far so good.  I can&#039;t attest to the GI problems, and I don&#039;t know if I have the night time issues (I sleep like a log and am single so no one is there to tell me what is going on while I&#039;m sleeping).  I do have sleep issues, but not related to Viibryd.  I have found that the Viibryd doesn&#039;t help with anxiety/anger issues, so the doctor suggested adding L-Theanine and that helps tons!"
