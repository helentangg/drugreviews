"The best anti-depressant I have ever experienced, I couldn&#039;t sleep longer than 5 to 6 hours a night of broken sleep, now I average 8 hours of fit full sleep. When things don&#039;t go my way now I simply shrug my shoulders, before I thought the World was conspiring against me. The drug seemed to work for me almost instantly, didn&#039;t take me the normal 4 weeks before I noticed an improvement in my mental well-being. Can&#039;t thank the creators enough. Big ups!!"
