"I began taking Celexa 10 mg tablet 3 years ago -  one every evening.  I find that it helps a lot with low moods and mood swings especially around the time of my period. I&#039;ve always had mood swings but didn&#039;t quite understand why I felt so bad on some days and felt pretty good other days.  This pill helps to regulate my moods so that I&#039;m feeling good most of the time!"
