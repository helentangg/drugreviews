"I started Lexapro the summer before my sophomore year of college and have now been on it for about 6 months now. It worked pretty well in the first month, my anxiety went down but after that it felt useless. We upped the dosage all the way from I think 5mg to 20mg by the end of the summer and still felt useless. I decided to continue taking Lexapro as I went back to college and I still felt like it was not working. I still felt really anxious and on edge all the time so I decided to go to the school&#039;s psychiatry center, which during my screening they told me that Lexapro is actually known for dying out over time. I stopped taking it and my anxiety is through the roof. Overall, it helped me but not as much as I&#039;d liked it to"
