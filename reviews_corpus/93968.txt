"Since starting on the 5mg trintellix for a week I started to notice a gradual difference in overall anxiety and depression.  For several months I had been taking Celexa with no change, then Lexapro with very little change. I take the 10mg trin in the morning and can notice more of a difference now than with prior SSRI&#039;s. I also take two 1mg dosage of clonazepam  throughout the the day.  For those who have tried so many others I recommend a start on the 5 for 7 to 10 days, then a direct increase to the 10mg. If the 5mg isn&#039;t packing enough of a punch. I&#039;ve had no side effects but this med is expensive. Several pharmaceutical reps. I know also take it and have said they can tell a difference."
