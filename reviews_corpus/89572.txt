"I was on Celexa and Xanax for 8 months and thankfully didn&rsquo;t experience any crazy side effects; was just a little more tired than usual but not to the extent that it was affecting my work or social life.  I thought I was fine and no longer needed to take medication so I weaned myself off in early February however within 2 months I started feeling the way I had been feeling prior to starting treatment.  For months I tried making myself believe that I was just feeling stress and anxiety because of work, but after battling mood swings, distancing myself from my friends and family, drinking and smoking excessively, and being in a seemingly perpetual funk I realized it really wasn&rsquo;t fine and it was time to get my life back.  Last week I started yoga, took a break from alcohol, and went to see a doctor.  He put me back on Celexa and switched me from Xanax to Klonopin.  Today is my first day back on the medication and although I am not thrilled to be back on this type of treatment, I am very much looking forward to feeling &ldquo;normal&rdquo; again."
