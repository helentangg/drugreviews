"20 year old female student with mild-moderate depression for about 2 years. Originally given Lexapro with the average side effects of appetite increase and complete lack of sex drive. After three months, I switched to Pristiq under the recommendation of my mother who takes it. I didn&#039;t have any noticed side effects. However, after a few months my dosage was increased to 100 mg opposed to 50 which is normal depending on ones weight. Though not everyday is perfect, Pristiq has helped me so much by getting me to function and no more random crying spells. (Also, it helps you feel human by getting your libido back). Everyone&#039;s different but Pristiq works for me and I wish everyone the best in finding what they are looking for."
