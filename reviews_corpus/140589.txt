"I have been depressed over 20 years, been hospitalized for a major depressive event and suicidal. I have been on numerous antidepressants over the years. None of which worked, I have been on escitalopram for 6 years (10mg) and I can say that I am normal and happy. It works for me. I tried 20mg for a while, but it made me too sleepy. The 10mg works for me.
My wife of 47 years passed away 2 months ago. I am grieving but not depressed. Sounds strange, but I definately know the difference."
