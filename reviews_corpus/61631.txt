"I am a 35 year old mom of 2. I&#039;ve always tried to manage my anxiety on my own by always keeping active. The more I stayed focused on a task, the less I worried about something else. Losing my father, going through a separation, 5 deaths in my family in less then 3 years. I wasn&#039;t happy with my career and I had all of this on my mind being a single mom. I managed, I continued to smile, I didn&#039;t feel sad all the time. I just became a worry animal. I would lash out, get angry, scream and panic. Still through all of my anxiety I tried to do it on my own. Until my doctor prescripted Celexa. One day I noticed a difference. It&#039;s been 1 year and I am living a much fuller and happy life. The meds have helped me relax and breath for once in my life."
