"I have had anxiety attacks and depression on and off my whole life and when I started this medicine it was like a 180 on my mood issues. Sounds funny but it made the whole world beautiful for me again. I have been on it for about 6 months now and ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS MEDICIAN, however I have had sleeping troubles here lately and am experiencing vivid dreaming to the point that when I awake I am disoriented and my sluggish/somber mood is creeping back in. I have good and bad days- I&#039;m thinking that it is from lack of sleep because of the constant dreaming, so I am now taking Xanax at night and it has helped that problem a lot."
