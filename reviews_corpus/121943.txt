"I&#039;ve been taking Effexor XR for about two months now. I was in the hospital after a suicide attempt when the psychiatrist there put me on it. At first I had the worst side effects. I was super tired, couldn&#039;t concentrate on anything, and got dizzy all the time. After about two weeks those went away. I have moderate anxiety and it&#039;s helped a lot with that. I still get nervous a lot but I haven&#039;t had an anxiety attack since I started taking Effexor. For my depression though it hasn&#039;t helped at all. I still find it hard to get out of bed, can&#039;t sleep at nights. Also, I missed a dose once and it was not good at all. I was miserable. I was tired, had the worst headache, and I was about ready to jump in front of a train."
