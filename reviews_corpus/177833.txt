"I&#039;ve been taking 60mg for 2 years for back pain and anxiety. I&#039;ve been happy with the results for the most part. Recently I visited an ear, nose and throat specialist because my hearing has been a little bad. I found I had sudden hearing loss in my right ear. Well I have prefect hearing in the left. None in the right. The Dr said it was strange. But, as we know they are Dr.&#039;s of medicine for a reason. They believe in it. We&#039;ll I&#039;ve decided to come off and have reduced it to 30 mg. for the last month and that is a tough ordeal. I would say that the result was like a miracle but, I&#039;m afraid that the hearing loss could be related and I&#039;m very concerned. It isn&#039;t easy to quit either."
