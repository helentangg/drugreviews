"After years of knowing something was wrong, I went to the doctor and he prescribed Cymbalta. I have been on it for 6 months.  I love it!  I will be married a year in October and my husband and I were already talking divorce until I started Cymbalta.  I did have VERY violent and &#039;goury&#039; dreams when I took it right before bed.  Now I take it in the morning, my dreams are back to normal.  I am currently taking 60mg, but am going to request to take a lower dosage as I am now starting to experience headaches and nausea.  I feel like I am finally the person I always knew I was and not the bitter, angry, weepy person other people saw."
