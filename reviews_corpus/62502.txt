"I started taking Citalopram about 6 months ago when I began having severe anxiety and panic attacks. I had been under a lot of stress in all aspects of my life and was also having trouble sleeping.  I just wanted to run and hide.  I was scared of everything to the point I had difficulty even driving.  I was afraid of losing my job because I just couldn%u2019t function normally.  Today I feel like myself again and can sleep all night. I do not plan to quit taking Citalopram anytime soon.  I do on occasion still have panic attacks, but it is very rare and my doctor recommended 0.5mg of Alprazolam on those rare occasions and increased my citalopram dosage from 20mg to 30mg.  I expect the new dosage to end all panic attacks."
