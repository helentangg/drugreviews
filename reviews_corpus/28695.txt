"I&#039;m on day 2 of taking Lexapro and it&#039;s causing unpleasant side effects. I don&#039;t have an appetite, a slight headache, nervousness, and stinging chest pain along with stomachache. My doctor told me to stick with it because the benefits outweigh any issues right now. He also said that they will go away in 2 weeks or so.  I&#039;ll continue to take and update my progress."
