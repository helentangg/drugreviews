"I have been on 120 mg of Cymbalta daily for 8 months, as well as another year and a half at 60 mg. I take it for anxiety, MDD, OCD, panic disorder, PTSD, etc. In addition to 10 mg of Abilify and a benzo I am feeling almost back to normal. This happens to be one medicine that helps me, and I have tried many SSRI&#039;s over the years."
