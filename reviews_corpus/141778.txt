"I&#039;ve had OCD for 25 years. I&#039;m 39 now, when I was 22 I could not take it anymore, first it was Prozac, then Paxil, etc. But the best one I found out that works best for me is Lexapro. It is amazing for OCD.  I was a door checker like 20 times and the stove too, and my mind would repeat the same things over and over and over. Today I feel a lot better off."
