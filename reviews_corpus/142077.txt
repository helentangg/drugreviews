"I&#039;d never experienced depression until I was getting a divorce. Depression is frightening. Talking didn&#039;t relieve my despair. Then came new, nightmarish experiences: panic attacks. My doctor put me on Lexapro and I went to therapy. I felt immediately better physically, which paved the way for my eventual and complete emotional healing. I went off the drug once, crashed (don&#039;t quit suddenly, taper off if you have to). Now I take it again (low dose) with the same wonderful results."
