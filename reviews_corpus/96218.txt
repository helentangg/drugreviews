"I hadn&#039;t found an anti-depressant that worked until my OB put me on Zoloft towards the end of my pregnancy. All others made me suicidal and I am already diagnosed as a manic depressive. Zoloft is amazing with the exception of the yawns and difficulty having an orgasm. But it&#039;s all worth it to have a medicine that actually works."
