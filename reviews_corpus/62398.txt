"My panic attacks used to be so severe in the same year that I experienced them, that I was almost rushed to the hospital because my family was worried. My heart would pound so fast and hard. I literally thought it was going to explode. By my heart beating uncontrollably for panicking, my chest would hurt a lot and I would get so dizzy and lightheaded. After a year and a half of the horrible random attacks, I was prescribed Celexa and my life has been amazing. I no longer have worries and in the 2 months that I have been on it, I have not had 1 attack since. 
I highly recommend Celexa to those who experience panic / anxiety attacks. "
