"I took this to help with a personal issue at work. I am a teacher of 17 years and never lose control as some situations which I had little to no control caused me to have an anxiety attack. The doctor prescribed 20 mg Celexa and half of the pill for 6 days then a whole 20 mg. Day 1 I did not get sick but at work I was very calm and easy as I am like that 90 percent of the time without medicines anyway but things tend to bother me and I keep them bottled up and hidden inside, which caused me to have the anxiety attack. This is day 2, I did take the other half of the pill. I will see how it goes for today. I am thinking of only taking the pill as needed as I tend to hold on to the negatives in my life. I believe Celexa will help me greatly."
