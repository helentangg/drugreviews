"I was put on this for my anxiety disorder and my bulimia/anorexia. I was put on 5 mg and than bumped up to 15 mg over a months times. I started this drug three months ago and last month I had to be taken off. I had bruises all over my legs, I had no energy, I would fall asleep at 10pm and wake up at noon the next day and be taking a nap at 3pm. My anxiety improved some but those side effects were too much."
