"I have always had anxiety my entire life my dad also suffers so guess that&rsquo;s where it came from I suffered a lot in social situations always worried I was going to embarrass myself even though I know I have a lot to say for myself and am naturally quite funny but always held back it&rsquo;s been four weeks on it at 20mg and I am only writing this review as I feel it may help someone that was in my position it has helped me so much. I just feel relaxed talking to people, all the silly situations I use to make up in my head that might happen I don&rsquo;t do anymore. I just feel like the person I should of been my entire life felt more anxious first two weeks but stuck with it now just feel normal no worry and I can just be myself best thing I ever done"
