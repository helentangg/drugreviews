"This review is premature as I am on day 4.  I awoke on day 3 with a peaceful mental outlook and very little anxiety, which is most unusual for me.  I have a lot of work-related reasons to be anxious.  I am very happy and look forward to continued improvement with Cymbalta.  I feel hopeful, not hopeless!  Only side effect has been a mild headache that went away with NSAID."
