"I started this medication about 10 days ago.  Doxepin, 10mg, has been working more days than not.  Like most medicines, the first few days it worked like a charm.  I took it and I slept about 5.5 hours straight.  Sometimes can go back to sleep for another 1/2 an hour.  I do feel a little help in the anxiety category.  Not a lot but it does help a bit.  The bad thing about this medicine is that you feel very sedated throughout the day.  You know you slept because of the vivid dreams and you don&#039;t wake up the whole night.  Nevertheless, you feel extremely tired the whole day.  I wish I didn&#039;t have to take medicines.  But I rather be feeling sleepy and knowing that I slept as opposed to feeling sleepy due to no sleep."
