"I have been taking this pill for about four months and It was working and I felt a little better, not so many panic attacks but it didn&#039;t help as much as I thought. Be careful when going off Effexor, the withdrawals are horrible. Most pain I have ever felt in my head. Do not just stop taking it. Effexor just wasn&#039;t the right one for me."
