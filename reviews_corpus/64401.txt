"I first started taking this in 2012 and at first all it did was make me incredibly tired but then it also made my moods more up n down and caused me to have psychotic episodes. i abruptly stopped taking it at that point (stupid i know....i shouldve tapered off) and from doing so i had extreme psychotic episodes. 
Ever since taking it all those years ago, ive had numerous psychotic episodes. My dr thinks it was the sertraline that reacted badly with my brain, leaving me now prone to having psychotic eps. 
I tried different dosages too, starting from the smallest dosage. I would never recommend it to anyone after what i experienced with it but then again everyone is different. All i know is that Sertraline made me worse mentally."
