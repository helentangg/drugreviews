"Hi...Ive been on Paxil 11 years. Its the only thing that helped my depression and social anxiety disorder. The only side effect I have is weight gain. It will cause withdrawal if you stop taking it for a week which happened once when I didnt get my script refilled. But all in all its helped me greatly. I&#039;d rather have weight gain than severe depression and anxiety and fear of crowds. I give it a 10 for my case."
