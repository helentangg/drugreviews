"It took 3 years to figure out that it was the Effexor that was causing my constipation.  I was given MORE prescriptions to counter-act, but that just didn&#039;t work-actually moved me to beyond the other end of the spectrum.  After forgetting a dose and experiencing the withdrawal symptoms, I immediately wanted to get off, but because I really didn&#039;t have any other options, I just continued on.  I have tried many other different medications to help cope with depression and anxiety-Effexor seemed to work on the brain, but what it did to my guts is far worse.  Multiple imaging, ER visits, unnecessary surgery and even a trip to the Mayo Clinic to figure out why I couldn&#039;t poop.  To me, Effexor is POISON"
