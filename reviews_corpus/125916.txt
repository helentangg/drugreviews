"I have been experiencing increasing anxiety the more I progress into menopause.  Tried Cymbalta and it made me so drowzy that I was afraid of falling asleep while driving.  Started on Vybrid about 2 months ago and I feel fabulous. My anxiety is totally under control and I have energy to go out and do things. Recently lost 5 pounds because I had the energy to work in the yard.  There has been some diarrhea but it does not bother me as the benefits are such a difference in how I feel."
