"I have developed panic attacks and anxiety almost a year ago and been put on 50mg of sertraline first which did a good job at stopping my panic attacks, however I had plenty of side effects so my GP changed sertraline into 10mg of citalopram which has been wonderful for me. I still feel anxious every now and then but nothing I couldn&#039;t handle. And no side effects at all."
