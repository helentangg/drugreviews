"I had horrible anxiety attacks last fall, to the point that I thought I would just rather die then have a life like that. It took me over 2 months to try Zoloft, and it was the best decision I ever made. The first week was filled with an even higher level of anxiety, but it didn&#039;t last throughout the day, and in the evening I started to feel normal. After about 2 to 3 weeks, I was completely back to normal, and I was upped to 100mg/day. I don&#039;t think I needed quite that much, but I followed doctors orders from 25 to 50 to 100 in the 3 weeks time. I am now taking 50mg every other day, (because I&#039;m feeling so good, I keep forgetting to take it). It&#039;s been over 6 months, and I feel fantastic."
