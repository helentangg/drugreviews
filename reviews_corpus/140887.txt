"I suffer from severe anxiety and panic attacks.  I am on day seven and haven&#039;t noticed any improvements, my anxiety  was increased and I am experiencing some dizziness.  However I am going to let the pill take it&#039;s course even though it&#039;s been hard to continue on it.   My dad took the pill and had success with it so I&#039;m hoping that&#039;s the case for me!  Most of all just think positive that it will work! You will get through this! :)"
