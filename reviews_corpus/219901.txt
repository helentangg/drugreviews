"I have been on amitriptyline for almost ten years. It has basically saved my life. I had migraines that did not stop. I take 37.5 mg nightly and haven&#039;t had a migraine since. I did not believe my neurologist when he wanted to try this med. I had almost given up on any medication working. I am now scared to not take it. I was not a believer, I am now."
