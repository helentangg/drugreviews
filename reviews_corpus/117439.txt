"I&#039;ve been taking 30mg a night for 7 or 8 years now.  It doesn&#039;t stop the migraines but it lessens the pain and makes them less frequent.  One of the better medications I have tried.  Others have either not worked or have had horrible side effects.  I tried to go off of Nortriptyline twice now because I do feel it increases my appetite, but both times the headaches got worse.  So for me Nortriptyline and Botox shots have been the most helpful."
