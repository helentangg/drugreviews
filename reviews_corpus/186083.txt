"Not the medication I was looking for. First two weeks it eased me off my depression. Then all the side effects came into play. Extreme anxiety, sweating, and feeling out of it and high all the time. Forgetting to take it was like hell and made me physically sick and agitated. Would not recommend if celexa or prozac worked for you at one point. Made me feel like a zombie and hard to get anything done. Felt a lot of fatigue as well. Overall horrible experience with a big price attached to it."
