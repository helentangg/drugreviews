"I had terrible back pain and leg pain. Walking was getting very difficult even for short distances. The effect of Cymbalta was almost amazing. Within a week my pain had diminished to such a degree I felt almost normal. My pain was so bad I used to cry almost every night. I am just hoping this medicine keeps working for me."
