"Viibryd has changed my life for the better. I now have more energy and a positive outlook on life. I&#039;ve read of several people having restless legs. I,too, have this from time to time and I&#039;ve been on Viibryd for almost a year now. (20 mg a day) I have found that exercise takes care of this problem almost completely! I still have very slight waves of dizziness and some GI problems. I&#039;ve had the opposite problem that most people get on this med, that being diarrhea. I have constipation, but I just drink more water and eat more fruits &amp; veggies which helps tremendously. The benefits of this med far outweigh the side effects!! Oh, I also have the very vivid dreams!! Very strange!!"
