"50 year old male with depression and anxiety from life changes and job.  Resisted for a long time and judged others on SSRIs as weak. Finally crashed and admitted I needed help.  Three months out now on 10 mg/day.  Initial side effects were chills, yawns and slightly tense jaw muscles.  All of that disappeared. Now I&#039;m free of depressive bouts and greatly reduced anxiety.  Has allowed me to enjoy things again and I get better sleep.  I take it in the morning."
