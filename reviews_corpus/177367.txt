"Cymbalta is from the devil  Evil, evil drug. Trying to stop it is hell on earth. Severe anxiety and emotional pain. 
Horrible dreams. I am an absolute wreck. Didn&#039;t take it for three days and was in extreme trouble. They don&#039;t make the dose low enough so you can get off it. Lowest is 30mg. Load of garbage."
