"I have tried so many medicines like Zoloft, Bupropion, Venafaxaline, etc. I talked to my doctor and he decided to put me on Viibryd as a last resort before turning me over to a Psychiatrist. He said 80% of his patients had a positive result from taking Viibryd. Only 20% didn&#039;t. I have only been on Viibryd for a total of 2 days (counting today) and my mood, irritability, stress, self motivation and self confidence have felt miraculously better. So much so that my husband told me yesterday (1st day of 10mg pink pill) that it was good to have me back for a day. I notice I am not as stressed when stressful situations arise. Yes, I have had side effects, nausea, diarrhea, but I feel overall better."
