"I have had a recent history of anxiety and depression (last 5 years) and have tried several medications for both disorders.  Unlike Lexapro, I felt all of them had much more pronounced side Effects.  I have been taking 10mg of Lexapro for two months and feel it has really hit the &quot;sweet spot&quot;. The only noticeable side Effect has been a short period of &quot;the jitters&quot;.  I&#039;ll feel this is a really useful medication with a very pleasant &quot;mellowing&quot; effect."
