"I love taking Cymbalta for my depression but because of the high cost of it even with Insurance I am weaning myself off of it. I&#039;ve noticed that since I am not taking it as often my pain is going away. I know this medication is supposed to help with pain but it has actually caused me lower back and hip pain since day 1."
