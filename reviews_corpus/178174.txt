"Cymbalta has given me my life back. I finally feel like me again. The loving, caring, free-spirited person I had forgotten about. I can finally function, which is so important to me. I am getting a 4.0 in college. I feel like a walking miracle! I can&#039;t believe where I am today; that a pill could literally save my life. I was so close to suicide, so violent, and so depressed. I wanted to die. I&#039;m FINALLY HAPPY! 

It&#039;s sad that Cymbalta has low reviews from people withdrawing from it. I&#039;m sure it&#039;s difficult. But does that take away from how much it helps!? I might be on it the rest of my life, who knows? "
