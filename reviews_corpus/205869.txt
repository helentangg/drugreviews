"I suffer from extreme anxiety and severe depression. I have been on Cymbalta for a couple years and it makes me so tired. I couldn&#039;t take it anymore. I slept all day. I started Pristiq today around noon. I have noticed a boost in energy and can&#039;t stop smiling. The only side effects so far is blurred vision, a little jittery, sweating a lot but I haven&#039;t felt happier in years from one day!"
