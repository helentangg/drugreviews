"Since I started taking Viibryd I have been happy and have had energy to do things again. My Dr gave me some samples of the starter box that started out at 10 MG for the first week. Then increased to 20 MG on the second week. I&#039;ve been on 20 mgs for two months and I feel better than I&#039;ve felt in years.  Before I started taking it I always felt down and out and always wanted to lay around on the couch. The only thing that I have bad to say about it is that on the first 4 or five days my stomach stayed upset and I felt very nauseated. But after about 5 days it passed and I started feeling great!  If I could recommend this to everyone that is feeling depressed I would!  It is a wonder drug to me!"
