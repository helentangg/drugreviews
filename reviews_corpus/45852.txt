"I am 25 and have been put on fluoxetine for the 3rd time this year for an anxiety disorder. I like this medication but I have experienced some weird side affects. In the beginning of each new time prescribed I get really nervous, sweaty, panic attacks, and some times feel dizzy. All side effects eventually go away, but it is very tough to get through the first 2-3 weeks. I am on the 3rd week now, but the side effects don&#039;t seem to be getting better. I don&#039;t want to give up though because it has been so helpful in the past for me."
