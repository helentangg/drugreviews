"I wanna take the time out to thank who ever invented Zoloft. I use to be so depressed,  I didn&#039;t want to be around my kids or my husband.  I would tell my husband I was tired of existing.  My life was turning inside out. So I knew I needed help so I talk to my doctor I explained to her what I was going through and she said Zoloft would be perfect. I didn&#039;t want to believe I needed meds but coming to find out it wasn&#039;t bad at all. I&#039;m happy now my kids love to play with me and think I&#039;m so cool!!!  My husband who was so patient just loves all over me and he&#039;s proud I didn&#039;t give it. I&#039;m only 28 yrs old and I feel like I&#039;m a teen all over!!! Thanks Zoloft"
