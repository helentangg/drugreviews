"This medicine has been a life saver for me. It is the only antidepressant that has worked. I lost weight on it (which I needed to), feel less stressed, can handle stress, thoughts are not obsessive anymore, I laugh more and interact more with friends. I don&#039;t feel scared everyday. If you are thinking of taking it, give it at least 4-6 weeks to kick it. It&#039;s worth it."
