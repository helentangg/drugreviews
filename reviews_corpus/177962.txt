"It&#039;s an okay medicine for depression, but I&#039;ve had times where I&#039;d miss one day of Cymbalta and immediately feel withdrawal symptoms (brain zaps, nausea, headache, etc...) The only other medicine I&#039;ve ever had this happen with is Effexor. I hate that I have to make sure that I have to take this at the right time of day, because even being late by like 6 hours, I feel the withdrawal symptoms kicking in."
