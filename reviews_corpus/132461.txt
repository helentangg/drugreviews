"Hi milemile I have been on doxepin many years for panic attacks before this medicine I stopped going out anywhere. You will be tired for a bit of time but it goes away . It stopped all panic attacks. Never had one panic attack for 10 years on this medicine. But I stopped to try other meds for higher mood.  But when I stopped doxepin the panic attacks returned so 10 years without panic attack on doxepin is a good thing!"
