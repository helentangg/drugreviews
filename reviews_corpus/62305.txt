"I was to the point of hurting myself. I got put on citalopram and required counseling. For the first 6 weeks I thought &quot;Wow, I&#039;m doing better&quot;. Now I&#039;m back to the same old thing but I&#039;ve developed another diagnosis, moderate to severe anxiety, it sucks. I am having severe panic attacks. I cry myself to sleep every night."
