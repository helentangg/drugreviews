"I started Cymbalta in September 2011 for Depression and Anxiety. My doctor started me off on 30 mg a day for 2 weeks then switched me to 60 mg a day. The side effects I noticed right away were dry mouth and loss of hunger (not a bad thing - I lost 5lbs in 2 weeks). After being on 60 mg for about a month I started to have pretty bad night sweats, and I mean INTENSE night sweats - you wonder how your body can possibly hold that much water. But they have gotten few and far between now and my dry mouth has subsided as well. About 2 months ago my doctor switched me back to 30mg a day - the 60mg dose was causing my stomach to hurt and burn for about 3 hours after taking it despite taking it with or without food. It helps with GAD. Try it."
