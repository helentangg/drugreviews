"Lexapro has helped me so much. I am currently on week 6 of a 10mg dose. 24yr old male.  I felt the effects almost immediately. The first 3 days it gave me extreme ADD. I could not focus on one thing for more than 1 minute. My brain was jumping from thought to thought like never before. After the first week I suddenly had a moment of clarity and was able to focus better than I ever was before. My anxiety and depression in the morning completely went away. I was able to get out of bed. No more driving anxiety or thoughts of self harm. All completely went away. The only negative thing that I have found is one side effect. It now takes a very, very long time for me to reach orgasm during sex. Sometimes not at all. No matter how pretty she is."
