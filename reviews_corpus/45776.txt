"I had never taken an antidepressant before. I was recently diagnosed with gastritis and irritable bowel syndrome and have been dealing with many emotional issues for quite a long time before these health problems. The constant nausea from the condition only worsened my mood and outlook on life. I was on Prozac 10mg for exactly a month. After 2 weeks I noticed a HUGE difference in my overall mood and outlook on life, it was wonderful! After 3 1/2 weeks my entire body started to itch; palms of my hands, in between fingers, behind ears, feet, legs, arms, you name it, it itched! Finally talked to my doctor and decided to stop Prozac and start Paxil. I hate that I had to switch, and I&#039;m not too excited about it. Hope this time is a charm."
