"I&#039;ve suffered with depression for most of my life. I&#039;d taken prozac for almost 20 years and decided to try something else because of the sexual side effects. That started a 5 year nightmare of drugs and severe side effects. So I quit taking pills and tried to go it alone. After a year without medication I lost contact with my friends and most of my family, no longer went out for enjoyment, stopped writing and generally just comforted myself with TV. I finally went back to my doctor a week ago and he put me on Nortriptyline 10mg. The first two days were a painful introduction of lethargy and dizzyspells. On the third day my world had changed. I&#039;m talking to people, making plans, cleaning. After a week the sadness and death fantasy&#039;s are gone"
