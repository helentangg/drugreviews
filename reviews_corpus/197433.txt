"I&#039;ve been on Paxil for two months now and have seen significant improvement in my mood (no longer crying for no reason) and decreased feelings of anxiety. No side effects.  The medication has also helped me deal with my PTSD. I&#039;m able to breath and make good decisions  in situations that would otherwise be triggering.  After years of attempting to fix myself and deal with my problems on my own, I finally asked my doctor (with analysis by a counselor) for help. Paxil is just the right thing for me.  I still don&#039;t like the idea of being on medication, but the benefits are too great."
