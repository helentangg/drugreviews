"Paxil has been very helpful with my anxiety, I&#039;m not so tired and am much happier. The only bad thing I have to say about it is if you miss 2 days or more of it- it has the worst side effects I requested a refill to late (so it was my own fault) but I got shocking feelings in my head and finger tips I was light headed all the time and there were a few day I would wake up from a nights sleep and automatically start crying for no reason. I&#039;m still on it and intend on still using it. Just make sure there&#039;s no room for cold turkey off of Paxil"
