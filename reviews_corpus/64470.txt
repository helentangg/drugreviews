"This has to be one of the worst drugs I have ever been prescribed , the side effects are horrible , and have to take more medication to deal with them ! I started off on 50mg , then was weekly increased to 200mg . After 6 months of feeling like death I have decided to wean myself off of them . Everyone I talk to seem to be taking them , they appear to be the fashionable drug at the moment ( probably the cheapest )  and I have heard good and bad reviews , but everyone I&#039;ve spoken to has some kind of ongoing side effects . Definitely not the drug for me , can&#039;t wait to get off of them and hopefully start to feel more human again !"
