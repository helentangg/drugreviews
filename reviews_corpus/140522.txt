"The first few days I also (like others have posted) yawned non-stop. I was also sick to my stomach for about a week. The second week in I noticed that I lost the ability to get turned-on as easily by my fianc&eacute; which was incredibly annoying for me. She used to be able to have a couple orgasms during sex, and we made love several times a week. I&#039;m really frustrated because I&#039;ve lost such amazing sensation sexually. I&#039;m going to ask my doctor to taper me off of it, as soon as I can."
