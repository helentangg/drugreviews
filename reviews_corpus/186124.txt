"I am suffering from severe fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome since last 3 years and was initially on duloxetine up to 60mg. Initially at lower dosage help to alleviate my pain up to 50 percent and actually I felt like after many years I woke up fresh around 6 am in the morning at dosage of 60 mg but within a week it&#039;s made me a zombie specially in night. I had difficulty In sleep and in the midnight I started to have  electric shock like sensation. Than started on pregabalin  and increased dose to 300 mg which elevated my pain around 70% but I put up a lot of weight and joint pain. Settled on 50mg of desvenlafaxine with 80% pain relief with 150mg pregabalin further helped me. This combination worked best for me but still some pain killers raised my LFT 8tims further causing fatigue."
