"Suffering from debilitating depression and anxiety for many years I&#039;ve tried many meds that have very little effect and made me feel just emotionally numb. I tried Viibryd. My life has changed. The restless legs was definitely uncomfortable. But after being on it almost 2 years I only take 10mg every other day since it has had time to clear my head so I&#039;m able to learn some life coping skills. Love me some Viibryd!"
