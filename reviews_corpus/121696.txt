"I am currently taking 75mg of venlafaxine.  About 20 minutes after taking my capusule on day 1, I felt a little loopy for about an hour but nothing major.  My appetite was tremedously lower for the day as well.  Day 2 and now at today, Day 3, it&#039;s like I&#039;m taking a sugar pill in terms of side effects.  I have none at all and wouldn&#039;t feel like I was taking anythign except is has slightly reduced my level of anxiety and I notice that I&#039;m having an easier time focusing on my work projects.  I may need to increase the dosage at some point but I&#039;m going to give it a month to see if it needs some time.  Hope everyone else has the same postive experience that I have so far!"
