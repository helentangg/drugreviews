"Just transitioned from 60mg Paxil.  Went down 15 on Paxil, up 10 on Viibryd each week for four weeks.  No brain zaps.  Take with food in the morning.  Get a sleepy reaction for about two hours after taking it.
I get vivid dreams with this med.  No nightmares so far.  No diarrhea, but I&#039;m constipated b/c I&#039;m taking 450 mg Wellbutrin :(.
I like it a lot, very optimistic."
