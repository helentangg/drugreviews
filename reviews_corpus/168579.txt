"From day one, YES day one, I turned into an irritable, annoyed, aggressive person. I gave it a week, thinking my body was just adjusting. I stayed &quot;raged&quot;, we&#039;ll call it. Talked to my pharmacist, she recommended that I not keep taking it. I feel much better off of it. Will try something else."
