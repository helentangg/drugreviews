"I started taking depression medicine when I was 11 years old. I am now 24 and I have been on probably 10 different antidepressants over the years. Nothing has had such a positive effect on me as Cymbalta has. I am truly happy for the first time in a long time. I&#039;ve been taking Cymbalta for about 8 months now and I feel great. I have also been diagnosed with Fibromyalgia, which is one reason why my doctor thought Cymbalta would be best. Cymbalta has also helped some with my aches and pains. I have very little side effects with this medicine. I get nauseous once in a while and am tired a lot, but it&#039;s nothing compared to being without Cymbalta. This is by far the best medicine for depression and fibromyalgia."
