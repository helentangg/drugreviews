"After suffering a bereavement and going through menopause I suffered anxiety attacks. I continuously felt stressed - had the shakes when I woke up, and heart palpitations ...all in all life was bad. Eventually I asked my Dr for help. He prescribed SERTRALINE ( one week 25g second week 50g). The first 2 weeks I felt as though they weren&#039;t making any difference, but after the third week the shakes and palpitations stopped. Now nearly three months later I feel so much better in every way.
I sleep better ..enjoy my life again. I would recommend that anyone trying sertraline not to give up after the first two weeks if you don&#039;t feel any benefit, it does take a while to get into your system. As for side effects, I haven&#039;t had any."
