"My experience with lexapro has been overall well, I suffer from a severe depression ever since I smoked a very potent strains of cannabis which triggered me to get severely depressed and anxious, I didn&#039;t take lexapro until about 6 months of it sitting in my drawer after manning up and growing the courage to take half of 10mg for a week until the side effects subsided and raised it to 10mg, I felt less anxious at first then after 2 weeks I raised it to 20mg and felt less depressed and that&#039;s what I&#039;m currently on.
I&#039;m waiting till week 8 too see if it gets better to know if I should keep taking it."
