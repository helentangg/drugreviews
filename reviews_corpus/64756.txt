"I was prescribed 50mg for the first week and 100 every day afterwards. After the sertraline took effect I went from having usually daily anxiety attacks to having one approximately every 2 months, which is definitely a huge improvement and much more manageable. The only side effects I had were some appetite loss (which was very much needed since I was borderline obese before) and the usual sexual dysfunction, but that wore off after a couple of months."
