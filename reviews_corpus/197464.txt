"I have been taking Paxil for approximately 5 years.  I have had severe mood swings prior to my monthly menses since I was approximately 14.  I am 53 and I am grateful that Paxil is available.  During my pre-menopause I was having months with 2 periods and the mood swings were incredibly difficult to deal with.  My husband was considering leaving me as he could not handle it.

Since taking the Paxil, I rarely have mood swings, and I only wish this drug had been available years ago as I would have not only taken it faithfully but been a huge advocate.

I am not a drug taker as a rule, but even with side effects, the quality of my life has improved 100%."
