"I took it for fibromyalgia for 4 weeks. Had loss of memory, dizziness and fainting. Weened myself off with the help of my doctor. Withdrawals were horrible. Headaches, slurred speech, loss of memory, heart racing and palpitations, trouble breathing and dizziness. It lasted nearly 8 month. It was the worst time in my life. I&#039;m happy for those that can tolerate the side effects and are successful on this medication. This is just my story."
