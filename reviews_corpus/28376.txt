"I finally feel more mentally stable! I&#039;ve been on this for a week and a half and I already noticed a HUGE difference like ...I&#039;m in serious shock. This is like a miracle. I&#039;ve been diagnosed with depression, and every type of anxiety. I am now more talkative, I have way more patience &amp; I just feel so happy. Like I feel normal. And I had little to no side effects. I did 5mg for a week then upped to 10mg three days ago and since I started all I felt was more tired but that went away in the first 3 days. The first day though I took a nap after I took it and I lost my appetite for the night and I felt a bit shaky for 2 secs but after that everything was normal."
