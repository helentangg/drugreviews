"I am an 18 year old male. I started Cymbalta 3 weeks ago for Generalized Anxiety. My anxiety got to a point where I couldn&#039;t even sit down and watch T.V or surf the internet without getting stressed. My stress started to control me. It was controlling simple decisions, it controlled what I did! I started to avoid everything that would possibly stress me out. It became a viscous cycle. Even things like simply playing my guitar or attending my college classes was becoming difficult to do without getting anxious. NOW after taking Cymbalta I feel like I have the opportunity to be myself again, and without worrying about getting anxious or stressed! Now I control my anxiety, instead of it controlling me! Only side effect is delayed orgasm."
