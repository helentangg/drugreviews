"I have been on 48 different medications, of all the drug classes used for anxiety and depression.  I can honestly say, the same day I took this medication at 10mg, I felt calmer.  This truly knocks anxiety completely out of the water. My depression is also is total remission.  I also am not experiencing any side effects. This is a wonderful medicine, despite the bad reputation they have."
