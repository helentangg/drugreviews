"I was given samples of Silenor, and I&#039;ve been taking it for about two weeks. My problem is not only that I can&#039;t sleep for more than 2 hours straight, but it also takes around 3 hours to fall asleep. Anyway, I noticed that I was getting a lot of terrible nightmares right away with the Silenor. As someone who hardly ever even remembers her dreams, the nightmares were quite obviously related to the medicine. Also, the Silenor didn&#039;t help me fall asleep/stay asleep at all. My doctor switched me to Ambien, and I&#039;m trying that for the first time tonight. Most of you had a bad experience with Ambien and are loving the Silenor, so I&#039;m not sure how this will work out."
