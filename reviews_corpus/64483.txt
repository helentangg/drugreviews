"I suffered from a major bout of anxiety in my sophomore year of high school and it made life very difficult, I grew agitated and jumpy and the summer between my sophomore year and junior year, I started taking zoloft after talking to my doctor and was clinically diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and major depression. After being on it for a while, I noticed that my depression was getting better, when combined with therapy, I also felt less anxious at school unless I was in large crowds. This medication has been a huge help but going off of it for extended lengths of time has lead to sudden and small panic attacks without cause."
