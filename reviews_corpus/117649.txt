"Three years ago, after a hospitalization for a severe ischemic colitis episode, I had severe and unremitting nerve pain. I tried gabapentin which did work initially. After about 6 months, the pain gradually returned. I then was put on 10 mg of nortriptyline, which was like a miracle, no more pain. I take it at night and have no residual effects the next day. I wish I had tried it sooner!"
