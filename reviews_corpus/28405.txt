"I was prescribed Lexapro about a month ago. Initially I was sleepy all the time but I took it at night and now the only side effect is difficulty reaching an orgasm. I love this medicine! I was having several panic attacks a day and since being on 20mg/night I&#039;m back to myself! I&#039;m going to continue. It&#039;s like my own &quot;Happy Pill&quot;."
