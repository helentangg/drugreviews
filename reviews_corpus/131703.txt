"I&#039;ve suffered from severe panic disorder since I was 10.  I am 45 now. I was on 200mg of Zoloft for 18 years. It took away my anxiety, but also took away any motivation. I was a zombie for all of those years and slept all the time. My new Dr. suggested switching to Effexor. I was afraid that it wouldn&#039;t work and my panic would come back. I was so wrong. After a week on 37.5 mg, my energy was back and anxiety still gone. I&#039;m on 75mg. I can&#039;t believe I stayed on Zoloft so long! I can think and do things again! I don&#039;t sleep all the time. Everyone reacts differently. If this med doesn&#039;t work for you, I&#039;m sure there is one that will. Wish I would&#039;ve switched sooner. No side effects at all!"
