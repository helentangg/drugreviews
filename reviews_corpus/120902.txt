"I was prescribed the Effexor ER for acute depression and anxiety after a death in the family and only took it for a month, but it made me sane and able to face every day as a teacher without crying randomly throughout the day. That was 2 years ago. I was prescribed it again for the same thing when my fiance passed away. I thought I was ready to stop taking it after 3 weeks but I found myself fighting back tears over small incidents like breaking a pen or a student asking me a simple question about the material. I started taking it again and it&#039;s been a life saver for me. I can still take the time to reminisce at night and grieve, although the tears seldomly come. If you aren&#039;t on it long then the withdrawal isn&#039;t bad at all. Hope this helps!:)"
