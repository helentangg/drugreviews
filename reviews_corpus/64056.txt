"I highly recommend anyone suffering from anxiety to try this drug. I am 19 years old and in my second year of college, and I started experiencing anxiety attacks. My anxiety got to the point where I did not want to leave my apartment and was affecting my daily life. I did have a few side effects the first few weeks, but now I feel like my normal self! Highly recommend!!!!"
