"I just finished my first month of citalopram and I have to say I have never felt better. My agitation and anger has gone down significantly as has my anxiety. I feel as if I can let things go easier now. Through starting citalopram I realized that I had dysthymia because I didn&#039;t understand that people didn&#039;t feel the way I did on a daily basis until I started the medication and felt my mood improve significantly.Only side effects I had was drowsiness and constipation which was improved by drinking more water. Overall, I am so happy I started citalopram because I feel so much better now."
