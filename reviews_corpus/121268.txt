"After years of Chronic Arthritic Pain, I was prescribed Venlafaxine by a Pain Specialist Doctor at a leading Brisbane (Australia) Hospital. The results are remarkable, It works, No pain. Dosage 75mg daily for 4 weeks, increase to 150mg if required. I have only taken this drug for 3 weeks! No side affects."
