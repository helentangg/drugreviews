"I was very recently prescribed amitriptyline at 10 mg for fibromyalgia.
, which was also just recently diagnosed after complaints since the age of at least 18 ( now 38). 
It doesn&#039;t help me sleep, even with my low dose of Xanax that was prescribed a year ago, for sleep. Combining the two has given me a more restless sleep, BUT......
It has helped with my pain tremendously!!!
Within days, I noticed I could work longer hours ( self employed, thank god), and when I do get sore, it&#039;s not as extreme as pre- amitriptyline. 
I&#039;ve lost weight in these two weeks, as before I only ate once a day, and I think my body was holding on to any fat it could, now I graze throughout the day and think my metabolism has been kick started again."
