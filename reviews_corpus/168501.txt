"No SSRI or SNRI works.  Parnate works.  Food restrictions caused no problems at all.  Completely obliterated negative thinking and bad feeling.  To me, it&#039;s a miracle drug.  I was careful not to take other heavy duty drugs at the same time.  This med probably saved my life.  It should be used much more frequently."
