"I have a herniated and degenerated disc, sacrum joint disfunction and piriformis syndrome. It was very disabling, unable to get about, get dressed the pain was 10/10 had to crawl while being pregnant. If I did a lot of activities pain was on its way. Popped pain relief did physio, went to gym, good diet, Tens machine. Nothing really worked apart from being in bed for 3 days till pain eased. I have 3 kids and really thought my life was going to be living in chronic pain. I was prescribed amitriptyline for headaches. Any-way I asked my Dr for these meds for my back, so she agreed. Well I have a new lease of life! I still get stiff and have to re-crunch (set) my back but haven&#039;t been a day in bed since starting them this year I take 20mg."
