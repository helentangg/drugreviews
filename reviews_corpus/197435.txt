"Surprisingly this is the only SSRI I have been able to tolerate at low doses with beneficial responses and minimal side effects.

Taking 20 mg and it&#039;s doing well at 1 year to minimize depression and panic attacks, though I tried going to 30 and became insomniac, down to 20 again, no problem.  No sexual side effects at this low dose.
