"I have been taking Cymbalta for several years, having my dose upped slowly to a total of 90mg taken throughout the day.  30mg in the morning and 60mg at bedtime and even with the increases I have not had ANY pain relief that I have noticed from before I started taking the Cymbalta.  I can say though that it has somewhat helped me with some depression that I had begun to have due to the fibromyalgia."
