"Changed my life. I had been experiencing slight bouts of anxiety starting at around age 19. Hitting me hard, randomly of course, only a few times a year. Then when I was 24 something changed with my anxiety and I became completely crippled by it. I was being consumed by constant anxiety, worry, fear, etc every single minute of everyday including when I slept. I was out of control emotionally and mentally. I had to take a box of tissues with me everywhere because the anxiety was so severe I would burst out into tears even during the &quot;happiest&quot; of times. Finally after suffering for months I decided to give  Cymbalta a try, reluctantly though. After a week of relatively mild side effects it had changed my life and saved my life."
