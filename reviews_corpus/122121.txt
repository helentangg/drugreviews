"I have been on Effexor for 3yrs.  The only side effects that have been bad were ones caused when my doctors advised me to increase dose.  This caused me to fall asleep in classes, gave me severe anxiety attacks, paranoia and bi-polar like symptoms.  After taking matters into my own hands and suffering through the horrible withdrawal which felt like being hung over and having the flu at the same time I am on a better dosage.  This dosage has allowed me to continue living my life to an extent.  I do suffer from the mild side effects and am afraid to sleep during the night at times due to the intense dreams that I have.  Overall more good then bad."
