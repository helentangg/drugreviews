"I have now been on Zoloft for 2 months and happy to report, I&#039;m no longer NEEDING my oxazepam everyday YAY! 
Side effects I got were crazy heart palpitations, fatigue but both of these have subdued, mind you, it took 7 wks to do so, so for anyone just starting on it, stick it out. Its helped a lot with my anxiety."
