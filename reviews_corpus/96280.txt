"I have been on Zoloft for a year and I can honestly say it changed my life. I had suffered with anxiety and panic attacks since I was in the first grade, and I hated my life. I felt cursed. I felt weird because of it. It got to a point of hopelessness and depression. I did counseling, exercise, journaling, all-natural vitamins, everything. Nothing helped. I didn&#039;t want to rely on medication to help me get through life, but after talking to my doctor, I decided I had to. My doctor put me on a low dosage of Zoloft and I can honestly say, I&#039;ve never been more calm, focused, content, and determined. Zoloft helped me relax and deal with problems rationally. It changed my life for the better, and recommend it to any teenager who needs help."
