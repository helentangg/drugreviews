"I have been taking 100mg once daily for 7 weeks.  I have OCD with a racing mind, slight panics and obsessive thoughts. I re-read emails I send over and over... Within  2 days of starting the drug I found my racing mind wake ups in the middle of the night had stopped, so I am more relaxed at night and not in fear of the hours spent with music and strange thought playing on a loop in my head.  My Doctor said that my night time relaxing was unusual because people often find themselves suffering insomnia.    After now getting used to the new found night calm I have discovered that I am actually still sort of suffering the issues but I am more relaxed about it, so I still wake and roll around but without the anxiety and high stress that I had."
