"I was prescribed Amitriptyline to help with anxiety and sleeping issues, but it has also helped a ton with migraines. I was having at least one a week, but I haven&#039;t had one in almost 4 months (so far). I have had a couple of headaches, but they definitely weren&#039;t migraines, and over-the-counter meds knocked them out. I was at the point where over-the-counter meds weren&#039;t working with the migraines, so I&#039;m thrilled with the results. And it has improved my sleep considerably, also!"
