"I have had relationship centered OCD as long as I can remember, centering around the most important people in my life. I finally made the steps to seek out help and was prescribed 10mg of escitalopram about a month ago. I was worried about taking a medication that I feared would alter the way I think (but that&#039;s the point I guess!) but figured that I had been living with obsessive and intrusive thoughts for about 15 years, so I might as well try it. Wow. I feel so wonderful all the time. When I get intrusive thoughts, it is much easier to brush off because I don&#039;t feel crippling anxiety; I feel like I can think more clearly about what is rational and what isn&#039;t. I had no side effects and feel like now I can enjoy life better."
