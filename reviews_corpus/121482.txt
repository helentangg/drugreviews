"This medication has helped me immensely!  I tried Lexapro, but had too many negative side effects.  Effexor took about 6 weeks to fully work, but it really brought me out of the depths of my anxirty fuelled depression.  I finally feel myself after many years of living in the fog.  The side effects for the first 2 weeks for me were: insomnia, increased anxiety/depression, hot flashes, and nausea.  These all disappeared after the initial 2 weeks and it&#039;s totally worth getting through that rough patch.  Once Effexor started working I thought, OMG! I&#039;m back!  My body is dependent on it, though.  If I miss a dose, I get dizzy and nauseous.  Just know you must wean yourself off and not go cold turkey so you don&#039;t feel sick."
