"Hey guys my name is Daniel and I&#039;m 22 years old. I just want to start of by telling u a little of my 4 years of hell I been through. First of I was 18 when I started having panic attacks for NO reason. One night I just woke up with it and didn&#039;t even know what was happening to me, I thought of course I was dying or having a heart attack. Sure enough I was healthy and had all the test ran and of course was dignozed with General Anxiety. Then the fun started, (btw I find it very helpful to talk about these horrible illness in a joking way to teach myself they aren&#039;t going to kill me only make life a little more difficult) I had horrible Anxiety attacks and life as I knew it was just impossible."
