"I have fibromyalgia and started taking Cymbalta about 5 months ago. At first it was great. All my pain and depression disappeared. However in about 4 months I began to have severe wrist, elbow and shoulder pain.  My depression began to return and I became exhausted. Another side effect that was intolerable was sensitivity to heat. I could not be outside more than 20 minutes. I became violent. Today my doctor started me on withdrawal with 30mg (from 60mg) for 2 weeks and then 30mg every other day for 2 weeks. I can&#039;t wait to feel normal again. "
