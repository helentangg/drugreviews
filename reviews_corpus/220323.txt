"I have had migraines going on 20 yrs now.  I&#039;ve been on a beta blocker blood pressure medicine and Topamax.    Topamax decreased the headaches somewhat, but at the cost of very debilitating side effects of fatigue and depression and rapid weight loss that never stopped, therefore my Dr. stopped it. I recently changed drs and for the 1st time in twenty years someone decided to try something new, amitriptyline. I&#039;ve also suffered insomnia.  My doctor suggested preventing migraines and treating insomnia with amitriptyline.  I&#039;ve had one flare up in the past 3 months and sleep soundly through the night!  Amitripyline has caused weight gain but I am still healthy.  I&#039;ll take the weight gain over the migraines any day!"
