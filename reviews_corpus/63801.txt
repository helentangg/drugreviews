"Stick with this medication and you will feel better within 2-3 months! I was very skeptical and afraid to take this medication after I read bad reviews on it, but I was tired of suffering from anxiety and panic attacks. I really wanted my life back and be &#039;normal.&#039; I have been on Zoloft for now 8 months and I feel so much better! I&#039;m seeing a psychiatrist and psychologist because I don&#039;t want to be on medication for the rest of my life."
