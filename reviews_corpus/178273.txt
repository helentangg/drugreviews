"42 year female; also being treated for MVP (Mitral Valve Prolapse)- ongoing &amp; increasing chest pains, tightening/anxiety feeling, heart palpitations, skipped beats, etc. Suggested an anti-depressant to my Cardiologist after a girlfriend shared her Cymbalta story (she is diagnosed SAD). WOW Prescribed 30mg- took 1 every 3 days to start. Side Effects were: dry mouth &amp; extreme stomach pains/nausea but with every dose every 3rd day- NOTICEABLY less...after 2 weeks a &#039;full&#039; feeling instead of the nausea, no more dry mouth &amp; little/no appetite. Yawning a lot on days I&#039;m not taking it. All the side effects I&#039;m having that others have mentioned and stuck it out AND rated it very high...my ENTIRE mood has been altered. "
