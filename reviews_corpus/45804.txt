"I took Prozac when I was about 20 years old, and I felt a complete depression lift. My Mom and Sister benefited from it for treatment of depression as well. I&#039;m 30 now and currently back to battling anxiety and depression. I&#039;m reading a book called Learned Optimism, and I&#039;m working on changing my &quot;explanatory style&quot; from pessimistic to optimistic. Your explanatory style, (how to perceive and deal with stressors in your life) and be a number 1 contributing factor for depression and other mental health issues. I&#039;m debating starting Prozac again, or just wait for the depression to lift on it&#039;s own as my own thought process changes from negative to positive. I&#039;m just ready for the depression to leave now."
