"I have been on Brintellix about 4 weeks. 2 weeks on 5 mg and 2 weeks on 10mg.  I have been on numerous antidepressants for depression and anxiety.  This has been so far the best.  A little nauseous after taking it the first week and a half. Nausea went away after eating something.  No side effects after second week.  No weight gain so far.  Feel better everyday."
