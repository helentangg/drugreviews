"On day 1 of Viibryd I felt sick (i.e. diarrhea, nausea, and stomach cramps). The benefits definitely out ways the cons. My depression and anxiety has decreased significantly. I&#039;ll be hitting week 3 (40mg) of Viibyrd and I feel so much better. I don&#039;t think negative anymore or feel too sensitive about certain topics. I finally feel normal again because I have been battling with my depression. I will continue using Viibyrd."
