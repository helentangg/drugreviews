"I encountered a bout of hypochondria when Doctors couldn%u2019t diagnose some pain I was having.  Slight worry turned into full-blown panic attacks and daylong anxiety.  With anxiety comes a bunch of physical symptoms and I was certain each one of those symptoms was more proof of me having some sort of undiscovered health condition, feeding into the anxiety.  My physician suggested I try going on Lexapro for 6 months and I was at the end of my rope so I reluctantly agreed.  Side effects were horrible but they went away and within 1 month of my first dose I was completley back to normal.  I&#039;ve now been off it for 6 months and its like my entire episode never happened.  Lexapro saved my life."
