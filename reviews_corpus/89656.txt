"At first Celexa really helped.  I had more energy, was happy and was like my old self.  That lasted only about 3 weeks before I started feeling bad again and wanting to sleep all the time. I also had a claustrophobic feeling like I couldn&#039;t breathe.  I told my doctor and he also prescribed trazodone to take with it because he thought this would level me out.  The combination of the 2 made me dizzy, sick and very tired all the time. I couldn&#039;t even wake up when my baby was crying in the room next to me.  Needless to say, I had to quit taking the medicine.  I wished it would have continued to work like it did those first 3 weeks.  Also, I started to eat more after the euphoric 3 weeks were gone."
