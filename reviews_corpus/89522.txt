"Was on Citalopram for 1 month then asked my doctor to change. During the first 2 weeks I was getting an average of 3 hours sleep a night. Bed at 11pm, wake up at 2am, 3am, 4am, 5am, 6am, give in &amp; get up at 7am. Was completely devoid of emotions. Lost all focus, motivation, attention-span, was so much worse than before diagnosis &amp; prescription. Second 2 weeks I was given sleeping pills so I was sleeping 7-8 hours a night, but being 24 yrs old I refused to be dependent on sleeping pills and anti-depressants. Have now been on Mitrazapine just over a week, was like a light switch. Now sleeping easily between 10-12 hours/night. Emotions are back but as unpredictable as they were before diagnosis. Will wait and see."
