"I went on this medication as a last resort, I was at a point I couldn&#039;t leave my house, I cried all day and I had anxiety 24/7. I have just started taking the medication, the first day was terrible, cold sweats, brain zaps. I found I could not sleep. Now 3 days into the medication, I find I am much happier, perhaps I&#039;m being optimistic but the constant torture of obsessive thoughts and not being able to let the little things go has gone down. I would recommend this if you are at a last resort.  The past 2 days have been days that remind me of how my life was like before the year and a half of constant agony."
