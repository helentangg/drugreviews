"I have been on different antidepressants for over 25 years with prozac being the best for me until...Viibryd. This medicine was great! I had a lot of energy and lots of positive feelings. The only negative was that if I forgot to take it for a day I became very tired. I highly recommend it to you! It is expensive, about $150 a month. I got it for free because I was in a clinical trial for it. What is $5 a day to feel great!"
