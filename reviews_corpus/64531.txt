"I have suffered on and off with health anxiety since having my kids and it really got a hold of me a while back. I was constantly crying and having panic attacks. I truly thought I was dying and was obsessed with checking my body and spent a lot of time at the doctors. My gp prescribed this medication 50mg and it has saved my sanity. The first few weeks were not good and I felt even worse. But by week 4 the anxiety lifted and i could rationalise things. If I hadn&#039;t of taken this my life would of spiralled into a scary deep black hole. X"
