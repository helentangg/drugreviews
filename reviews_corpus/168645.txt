"This drug was miraculous!. It was as if I was waking from a 5 year nightmare. I was &#039;normal&#039; again for the first time in YEARS!....HOWEVER!..Medicare won&#039;t let me have it and I certainly can&#039;t afford $300 a month on a fixed income. Why do they &#039;give&#039; you samples, &#039;free&#039; 30 supply but then rip it out from under you for $$$$$$. Now I&#039;m on a generic Prozac and Lord only knows where THAT was made and   &quot;it ain&#039;t a workin&#039;!&quot;....I WANT MY VIIBRYD!"
