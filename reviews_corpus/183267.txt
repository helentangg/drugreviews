"I have been taking Cymbalta for about a year now. At first it WAS awful. I was started on 30 mg trial samples for a week and then ramped up to 60 mg a day after that. Getting on Cymbalta is very hard, and it really takes perseverance to get through the initial effects of it. I was previously on Narcotic pain relievers and drugs like Lyrica, Neurontin, etc. After being on Cymbalta for a few months, I noticed I didn&#039;t really need the narcotic anymore. (Oxycontin 10 mg x3 a day) -yes really! I&#039;ve found that it does make me &#039;sick&#039; and tired about 30 minutes after taking it, but it fades about a half hour after that. Taking it  with food seems to help with the sick feeling. Take it before bed if you are starting Cymbalta. It does work!"
