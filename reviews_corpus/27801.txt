"I have been taking lexapro for about six months now.  I was put on it for a panic attack and mild depression.  I am someone who never takes meds unless I have too and was very worried about being on this drug because I feared the side affects when it would be time to get off.
I decided on therapy and lexapro.  I am only on ten milagrams, 39 and petite.  I can&#039;t say that this drug has caused me weight gain but if I am extra hungry I choose a healthier snack.  I will say that the first few days of taking the med I did feel tired,  and tense in my arms but I will say the panic attack attributed to that.  I am doing great I am more relaxed and happier .  Therapy is key too.  Hang in there and talk to someone!!"
