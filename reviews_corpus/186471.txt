"I&#039;m a 30 yr old male.  I was on Zoloft for 5 years (gained 40lbs, couldn&#039;t ejaculate) then Cymbalta (nasty side effects). For a couple months My Psych doctor let me try Pristiq.  I loved it. I had/have awful anxiety and panic attacks with depression. (My anxiety is because of my depression). This medicine worked quick and I&#039;m now in my 7th month at 50mg once a day.  The last week, it seemed to dwindle down a little (not sure why?), as my depression and anxiety started coming back.  My same doctor just upped my dosage to 100mg a day.  I&#039;m hoping it wont let me down! I have to say that Pristiq is the best of 3 anti-depressants/anxiety medicines I have tried. Thanks all and good luck."
