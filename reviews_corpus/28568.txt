"I am 21 and was recently on this medicine for 4 months. I was prescribed Lexapro, it helped in more ways than one.  I&#039;ve always dealt with daily anxiety, but I had never known any other way.  A single worry could ruin the entire day.  While on Lexapro, it raised my emotional state to where it needed to be and also suppressed my anxiety. It was nice to be giddy and to care about people again.  No weight gain/loss to be noted, but it made me very tired and disrupted my sleep.  Woke up about 3 times a night compared to my usual zero, and my dreams were vivid and disturbing.  Don&#039;t go off cold turkey, even if your mood stays positive, there are physical withdrawals such as hand-eye coordination off, headaches, shakiness, clumsiness. Good luck!"
