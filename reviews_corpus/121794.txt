"Around the age of 10 I developed severe and debilitating anxiety. I could not even move out of bed at times without having a break down. I tried coping for a while, but ended up on anti-depressants. I have a lot of stomach problems and any anti-depressant in a pill form eventually caused vomiting right after taking them. My doctor suggested Effexor because it was a capsule. It was great on my stomach as long as I ate. I have slowly gotten better with my anxiety, but am not perfect. I am not sure if it is the medication itself or what though. I think the worst thing about the medication though is the terrible withdrawal symptoms. I get anxious, sick, nausea, dizzy, hot flashes and worst of all is &#039;brain zaps&#039; and my eyes jumping."
