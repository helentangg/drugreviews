"Hi been taking 10mg escitalopram for around 4 months it did work for depression and anxiety but still wasn&#039;t enough unfortunately didn&#039;t work for OCD and my anxiety is back. I&#039;m trying with 20mg I&#039;m 21 and I have suffered from anxiety and OCD long time.
It&#039;s very expensive also"
