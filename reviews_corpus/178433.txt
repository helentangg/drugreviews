"This drug is fantastic.  I had neuropathic pain and depression, due to the chronic pain, for over six months.  I tried NSAIDS and  other drugs which did little, if anything.  Cymbalta really saved me.  I tolerated it  well and had few side effects, dry mouth and a little wired for the first week on it but that was it.  It did reduce sexual performance and cause difficulty with orgasm, but it was worth it.  After 10 months I got off of it and everything returned but the pain. Fantastic."
