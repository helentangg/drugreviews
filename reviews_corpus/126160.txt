"From the first DAY I took Viibryd, I felt a difference. My usually frenetic thoughts were all of a sudden quiet. I was more patient with my husband and children. My negative outlook felt a little more positive, a little brighter. And the piles of laundry, dishes, dirty floors, etc. that used to stress me out to no end, now don&#039;t faze me as much. I feel like &quot;whatever&quot; and it feels good to be able to relax a little.

Reading reviews about side effects gave me great advice: take the pill at night because it can make you drowsy, and take it with a protein-rich food. Today I just increased the dose to 40mg after 2 weeks and I have some indigestion-type symptoms. A spoonful of almond butter helped immensely.

All in all, it is TOTALLY working for me!"
