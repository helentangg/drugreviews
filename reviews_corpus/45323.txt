"Had anxiety ever sense I can remember. Mostly manageable with out medication. In may I had a panic attack at work and decided to start fluoxetine again. I experience alot of physical symptoms that go with anixty so I wanted to get control of it. The 1st and second week were ok. Just a hit jittery but the 3rd and 4th week were awful!! Bizarre dreams, sweats, uncontrollable shaking and so.much crying and sick feeling. I also notice a very tight throat which is something I hadnt had before. Eventually one Friday evening all the panic from the last horrid 2weeks stopped! Then I have been.on the up ever since. I have been told that you experience a low before u get the high. Just got to ride it out! Still have very minor anxity sometimes"
