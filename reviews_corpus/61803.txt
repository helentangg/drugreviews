"Only been on it for a week and I&#039;m feeling awful.  I know I need to give it time but the panic attacks are worse.  I&#039;m having to take Ativan so I can calm down. This morning I woke up and had that all over feeling with sweats rapid heartbeat I know blood pressure was elevated.  I&#039;m feeling so defeated.   Head still hurts.  Having all the attacks again that put me in ER 4 times.  I love reading others comments and hearing it gets worse before better.   Thanks for the feedback."
