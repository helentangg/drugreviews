"I have suffered with anxiety and depression for over 10 years. I get it in cycles and it would last for 3 months at a time. 
I can&#039;t believe how stupid I was not to get help sooner. 
I went to the DR and he gave me citalopram 10mg one a day. Within 5 hrs of the first pill the anxiety had decreased.
On week 5 and feel better.
The only side effects have been hot sweats from time to time and wanting to sleep. I think I&#039;m on the mend."
