"I can&#039;t say enough about how much this medicine has helped me with depression. I spent years in and out of deep depression. I was finally diagnosed with depression and post traumatic stress disorder and started Prozac at 20 mg then went up to 40mg. I knew it was helping but I didn&#039;t fully realize how much until I forgot to take it for about 5 days. Then I started to feel the hopeless feeling I get with depression and I haven&#039;t missed a dose since. I&#039;m one of the lucky ones with no negative side effects. My libido is better than ever and I&#039;ve actually lost a few pounds. I sleep great and wake up every morning feeling rested and more positive about life than I ever have before."
