"I was crying over the weirdest things and didn&#039;t want to get out of bed. Then I started taking Zoloft 50mg daily, a month ago. I felt relief an hour after taking it. The side effects for me were stomach upset, decrease in appetite, and sleepiness. That only lasted a week. After three weeks I increased the dose to 100mg which my doctor suggested in the beginning. I have been on many different antidepressants since I was a teenager and this is the first one that I feel &quot;normal&quot; on. I don&#039;t feel emotionless or stay on a fake happiness high. I feel relieved and can deal with the day to day stresses."
