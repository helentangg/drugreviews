"To the gentleman whose doctor switched him from Klonopin to Cymbalta:  The reason you are suffering from severe anxiety is that you were taken off a Benzodiazepine too quickly instead of having been TAPERED off the drug.  Cymbalta is no substitute for Klonopin. Your doctor needs to go back to med school!  I&#039;ve been taking 60 mg of Cymbalta since 2009, after my husband committed suicide. It has helped me a lot with depression and anxiety, but I&#039;m finding that my anxiety has recently increased because my new husband has lung cancer. I was put on 90 mg of Cymbalta recently, and I&#039;m hoping that the higher dose will decrease, and not increase, my anxiety levels."
