"I have taken 25mg for anxiety for 8 years. I went off when pregnant but anxiety returned upon delivery.  I can not say enough how much this drug has helped me. I don&#039;t do the whole &quot;I want to feel good on my own&quot; thing anymore. I accept that I will always have anxiety but with Zoloft I live a normal life now. If I have a health scare and it comes on a bit I can still cope so much better now. I am so thankful for Zoloft."
