"Three years ago I started having atypical migraines.  It felt like the world was spinning in all directions at once.  I would throw up until my stomach was empty and then some.  Finally, after hours of this I would pass out, almost coma like.  The recovery was long and slow after each attack.  I was sent to a neurologist who prescribed Nortriptyline.  It was amazing!  They did start out with a low dose but it only had marginal effect.  They increased it to 75 mg daily and now I only have an atypical migraine every few months.  And they are not as severe and recovery is quicker.  So thankful for this drug."
