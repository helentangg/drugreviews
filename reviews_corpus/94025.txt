"I suffer from Bipolar with depression.  I had been on Trintellix (along with a mood stabilizer) to treat depression for approximately 7 months.  My moods had been stable for that long.  Then I had some added stress though and had severe depression... worst I have ever had.  This ended with me being hospitalized and taken off Trintellix.

My thoughts are it worked good for short-term for me, but not long term.  So take this medication with caution &amp; if depression gets worse then seek help immediately."
