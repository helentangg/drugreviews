"Was put on 10mg for intense panic attacks, and later moved up to 20mg. This stuff has worked wonderfully! I feel like I&#039;m finally the way I should be - you know how you see other people who are completely relaxed and at peace, and you wonder, &quot;why can&#039;t I be like that? Why do I have all this anxiety for no reason?&quot; Well, all of that is gone! It&#039;s amazing! I would recommend Celexa to anyone. The only downside is I experienced A LOT of side effects the first month I was on it - increased anxiety, jaw-clenching, headaches, insomnia. But, if you bear down and get yourself through the first month, it&#039;s worth it. I finally have my life back!"
