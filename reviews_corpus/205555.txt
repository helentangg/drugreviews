"I have been taking Pristiq for 3 weeks now. First week, a mild headache, and insomnia, but after reading forums I would take it early in morning, and sleep improved. This is the first antidepressant I have taken. I felt wonderful, and thought wow this is what I have been missing! Things that bothered me before, became insignificant. Week 2 much of the same. Week 3 I feel tired and slightly flat, much the same as I did before.  I had an anxious moment but distracted myself and it passed. First time I actively felt anxious. I will continue to see how it goes. Having feel the amazing, stable, elevated mood in the begining makes me consider riding it out."
