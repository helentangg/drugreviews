"I&#039;ve suffered from crippling anxiety and depression for over a decade.  I have been on every class of psych meds and they all gave me side effects, and didn&#039;t really help much.  I was extremely skeptical and didn&#039;t think this medicine would work.  Man I was wrong!  I was in the process of getting disability, because my anxiety and depression made me home bound.  This med improved me to the point I was able to work and attend school again!  My anxiety was manageable, and my depression came to a stop. I didn&#039;t even have side effects! I&#039;m on 20 mg. I&#039;m glad I tried this, or I wouldn&#039;t have my life back."
