"I am a 44 yr old female and I started taking 10mg twelve days ago.  The first week was really good.  I felt calmer, softer and less agitated.  I didn&#039;t feel depressed but I did experience some minor GI issues (nothing I couldn&#039;t deal with).  This week I feel slow and tired, unexcited about going to the gym anymore.  I can feel depression creeping back in.  I called the doctor today and asked if I could try going up to 20mg.  I&#039;m hoping I can get back on track."
