"I took this for 8 mnths. I had a heart rate of 100 beats p/min at rest, teeth grinding, dry eyes among other side effects. The negative side effects far outweighed any tiny benefit. Coming off this drug can be likened to coming off heroin although I suspect heroin might be a tiny bit easier. I first tried to come off it from 50mg cold turkey. After 2 days it hit me and I got very, sick quickly. So I decided to try again but this time taper off &amp; cut the pills (which you shouldn&#039;t do). After 2 months I got down to 1/4. Cutting the pills caused no issue and I didn&#039;t experience any ping pong with my brain but I did get horrendously ill again. The worst withdrawal ever. This drug should be banned."
