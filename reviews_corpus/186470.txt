"I&#039;m on week 4 of taking Pristiq, I had nausea, loss of appetite, foggy head, sleepiness during the day and sleeplessness at night for the first week.  The side effects are all gone now, and I think I&#039;m starting to feel a bit less depressed.  I think this medicine affects a person so gradually that it&#039;s hard to tell for sure if you are improving.  But when I look back to 5 weeks ago, before I started, I think I&#039;m less depressed.  I take 50 mg in the evening.  I was taking it in the morning because my doctor said I might sleep better at night if I take it in the morning.  But I found that I was very sleepy in the early afternoon when taking Pristiq in the morning.  So I slowly changed to taking it at night."
