"Lexapro (escitalopram) has saved my life twice.  8 years ago it helped pull me out of horrible depression/anxiety from postpartum depression after my 3rd child was born.  I actually ended up in the ER&#039;s psych ward.  This time I fell back into a horrible place at the beginning of the holiday season.  No real reason this time.  Just horribly depressed and full of anxiety.  I take 10 mg every day and I am in my 6th week.The differences is night and day.  I can sleep, eat, and enjoy life again with out waiting for the other shoe to drop.  I am very grateful, and would recommend this medicine to anyone who is as scared as I was."
