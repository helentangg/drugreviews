"My Doctor prescribed this for anxiety. 10mg. Although it seemed to help my physical affects of anxiety it made everything else much worse. Tired, anxious, head aches, brain zaps, ringing in ears, spacey, edgy, and not myself at all. I was turning into a walking zombie. It was awful. I couldn&#039;t tell if it was my anxiety or the side effects. I thought I was going crazy for 6 months. I finally talked to a Therapist and he took me off of Zoloft and put me on Lexapro. Which was much better but still pretty awful. I finally found the courage to ween myself off over a period of two months and I feel GREAT! So thankful to be myself again. Please make sure you really need to be on these before you  take them. Do your research and good luck!"
