"I&#039;ve been taking Cipralex on and off for the last 7 years but have been on it steady for the last 2yrs. This time I&#039;ve only been taking 5mg. because of the side effects I got before, but due to certain circumstances in my life I need to increase it because my depression has worsened and my anxiety is very high. The reason I went on it again was because of anxiety attacks and my depression was not good. I really hate to have to increase it again because of the side effects but I have taken many other anti-depressants and their side effects were worse. I&#039;m very sensitive to medication in general even Tylenol makes me fall asleep lol. But I&#039;m also thing that maybe taking Clonazepam on a regular basis may help with my extreme anxiety."
