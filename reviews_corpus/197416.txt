"Paxil may have some minor side effects but it has helped me a great deal. I do fidgit my hands and feet a bit but have no real side effects as long as I take it responsibly. When I first began, I could miss a few doses without problems but now it only takes one missed dose for me to feel it. And if you try to quit cold turkey it will have some serious side effects. Overall, I couldn&#039;t imagine living without it now that I&#039;ve found relief from my anxiety."
