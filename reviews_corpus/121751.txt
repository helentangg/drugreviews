"Was taking 150mg of Effexor XR for an eating disorder and depression, did not help me. Had terrible night sweats, would wake up in the middle of the night with wet clothes and I have put on a lot of weight and couldn&#039;t lose weight, I&#039;ve been totally off Effexor XR for around a week or so and I will never go back on."
