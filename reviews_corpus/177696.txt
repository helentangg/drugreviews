"I love Cymbalta and have been on it for 4 years and some change.  Used to be on 60mg and now 120mg since August 2014. However, I am 3 months into my nursing program and I&#039;m starting to feel anxious which I&#039;m sure is normal but I am thinking of adding a medicine.  I just don&#039;t want anxiety to start because I used to be anxious all my life until Cymbalta. I have clinical depression and generalized anxiety.  Cymbalta has been a miracle."
