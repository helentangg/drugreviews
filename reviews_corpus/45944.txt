"After being out of school for 7 months with severe gastrointestinal problems, I developed extremely severe depression and horrible anxiety with worrying about turning in work and working toward graduation (I&#039;m a HS senior). Before this I had never had any mental issues. At first, I didn&#039;t want to take more mind pills; the thought of altering my mental state was a bit frightening to me. However, after being on Prozacfor 8 weeks, I feel totally changed in a good way. I can think about items of concern and work through them without starting to worry or become extremely upset. My mind is FINALLY free from a huge amount of stress. This in combination with as required Xanax for anxiety attacks has helped me tremendously. Highly recommended."
