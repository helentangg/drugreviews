"I have currently been on Lexapro since 2/22/16 and I am starting to feel relief from my anxiety.  The first week was terrible with the side effects of headache, nausea, upset stomach and I was extremely sleepy, but starting at the end of week 2, I was able to tolerate it much better.  I have noticed now at week 3 that the things that use to bother me, don&#039;t bother me anymore or at lease I feel like I can tackle them without being irritable, snappy and moody.  I don&#039;t sweat the small things anymore and I have no side effects anymore.  I am glad I stuck it out.  I had determined in my mind that I was gonna take it for 4 weeks straight and faithful and I&#039;m glad I did.  I am so much better now.  Be encouraged...there is hope!"
