"Well I was taking Lexapro for about 7 months. My second day on it was breath taking and great! Life changing honestly! However 8 months later the depression came back &amp; almost worst. 
Today is my first day on zoloft &amp; I feel so much better from the way I woke up. I&#039;m ready to follow home, clean, cook &amp; kiss all over my babies! I&#039;m taking 50mg right now. I hope this helps someone that&#039;s willing to try it out"
