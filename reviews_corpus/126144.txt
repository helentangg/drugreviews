"I have had MDD for the past seven years. Within this period I have tried many SSRI&#039;s including Wellbutrin, Prozac, Lexapro, Celexa, and others. I have experienced the gamut of side effects including diarrhea, sexual dysfunction, weight gain, overactive bladder; you name it. Some medications even made me bipolar.

I began taking Viibyrd in the summer of 2012. Although it took a few months, my rational thinking capacity returned to normal. My energy was fully restored. My sexual function returned and I have minimal side effects. I have fully returned to the person that I was seven years ago. In essence, I have my life back.

I would recommend that you give this medication a try!"
