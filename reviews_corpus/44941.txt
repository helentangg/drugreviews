"I had been experience anxiety for a long time, and have always been a worry wart in general. I had been going to therapy and my therapist suggested going to a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with generalized anxiety and prescribed me 20mg of fluoxetine. I gotta say, it has truly helped! I&#039;ve been on it about 10 weeks now and I feel pretty great! I still get anxiety but nothing compared to what I had before. I&#039;m also generally happier. My only complaints are that I don&#039;t sleep as well. I take the fluoxetine in the morning but still find myself waking up through the night which makes me very tired during the day. My libido has also basically disappeared since going on it so I will talk to my doctor about it. Other than that, it&#039;s great!"
