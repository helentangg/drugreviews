"I have been on Zoloft for 4 months . I am now at 125mg per day.  Depression has slighly improved but not much effect on anxiety and panic attack.  Not sleeping better I am dealing with chronic pain and professional burn out.  I am thinking about swithching to Pristiq but I am afraid of side effects. I am amazed with the no side effects of Zoloft."
