"Lexapro has been amazing. I went through tragedy on 9/11 losing my wife. Doctors pumped me with so many medications. Multiple suicide attempts. I have been fortunate enough to start a new life with a new wife. We share her 3 sons and our daughter together. Lexapro has eliminated my anger, mood swings and has allowed me to live again."
