"I have suffered from major depression since childhood and have had fibromyalgia since 2000.  I&#039;ve tried Effexor, Paxil, Elavil, Zoloft, Lexapro, Wellbutrin, Nortriptyline, Prozac and on and on. All made my depression worse and left me so tired I couldn&#039;t function.  I promised her that I wouldn&#039;t quit taking it because of side effects and without talking to her first.  Three weeks I had had it but my husband kept encouraging me and my doctor was out of town. 5th week all the side effects (super, super fatigue, dizziness, nausea, stomach cramps, yawning, no appetite) have disappeared and I feel fabulous emotionally and physically. Give it time if you&#039;ve had little success with other antidepressants.  This one worked for me."
