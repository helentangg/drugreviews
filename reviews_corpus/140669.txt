"I am a 34yo female who is on Lex for THIRD time in 2yrs. Currently 10mg, however only use  5mg for the first few days. 7 days in this time &amp; feel great. 
I&#039;ve had mild GAD for years though only diagnosed 2 years ago. Before I was diagnosed I had suffered an ED a 24yo and have had insomnia for 10yrs. I also suffer depression. Was recommended Lex 2yrs ago &amp; I love it!  I sing &amp; laugh again. I feel like my old self! Usually takes 4 weeks. I go on it for 4-6 months then take myself off again as needed. 
Tips: take 1/2 dose for first week. I take at night with a sleeping pill to begin with. Take on a Friday so have 2 days to feel like crap. Up dosage when side effects lessen. Change to morning  if sleep affected. Saved me!"
