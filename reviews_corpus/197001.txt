"I have been taking Brisdelle for 7 months. I wanted to give it a fair chance.  I had fairly severe hot flashes but no other problems relating to menopause.  I went from having about 15 hot flashes a day to about 10.  The severity was a bit better but I still had a lot of sweat with each flash especially at night.  It was very expensive and my health plan didn&#039;t cover it so I came off.  Weaned myself off very slowly over a six week period.  The withdrawal is pretty severe.  Feelings of vertigo and dizziness.  Nausea and zaps."
