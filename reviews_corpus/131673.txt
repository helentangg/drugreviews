"I had been struggling with OCD and anxiety and rage issues for a very long time.  I decided to get help after my daughter was born.  I was put on a myriad of different pills until Effexor.  It calmed me down, and my OCD is almost non-existent.  But miss a dose and you will be sick like you&#039;ve never felt before!  Think of the worst flu you ever had...it&#039;s kinda like that but worse.  And all the anxiety comes back in full force.  It has really helped me to function,  but I would never have gotten on it if I knew how bad it was to get off it.  Try everything else before taking this.  It will help but at what cost?"
