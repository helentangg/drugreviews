"I have been taking this medication for over half a year now in 50 mg doses per day. I was originally hesitant to try medication because I am only a teenager. However, I&#039;ve had anxiety, and at one point even OCD symptoms, for a very long time. Once I finally caved, my world entirely changed. I can now enjoy life and people&#039;s company, my stomach is not upset all the time anymore, and I no longer have panic attacks. The only negative thing is that it can decrease libido, but not significantly enough for me to complain much."
