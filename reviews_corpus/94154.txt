"I was on it for 3 months when I stopped because it was $368 a month even with my insurance(I have a high deductible plan) after about a month being off I asked my dr for something else. He told me no because it took us so long to find that. He provided me for samples for the next 6 months. It was like a magic pill for me as far as my depression it even helped my anxiety to the point where I wasn&#039;t taking Xanax anymore. But it defiantly lowered my sex drive which has almost cost me my marriage. I also gained a total of 25lbs. After being on the medicine for about 6 months it seemed that it just stopped working. The depression is back and one some days worse than before and the anxiety has been so severe I had to go to the ER one night."
