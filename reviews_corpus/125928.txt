"Prescribed only by psychiatrists, Was weaned off Zoloft 200 mg, Effexor 225 mg &amp; Amitriptyine 150 mg. Put on Viibryd 40 mg Oct 11. FDA approved Feb &#039;11. Diagnosed w/ significant severe depression, severe anxiety &amp; seasonal affective disorder Feb &#039;01. 4 months after being on Viibryd, my psychotherapist of virtually weekly since Mar 01 said she could not believe the significant difference Viibryd had on me. 3 years &amp; 4 months later, I laugh frequently, my silly personality is back [I&#039;m very young appearing &amp; acting age 61], I enjoy life, I talk much more. Still have bad days, still have bad cries - yet what a difference! A miracle drug! I&#039;m grateful!"
