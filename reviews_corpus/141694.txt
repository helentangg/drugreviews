"I&#039;ve been taking 10 mg of Lexapro for almost 4 months now. Before I started Lexapro, I was very depressed and I wanted to end my life. Now that I am taking Lexapro the depression is gone but with a few side effects. I am thankful for this medication, but it does make me feel emotionless, restless, tired and I now have an extreme lack of motivation. I plan on talking to my doctor about this soon and hopefully I can find a better medication that will suit me better."
