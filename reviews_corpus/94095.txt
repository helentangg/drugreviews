"I have been on brintellix for three weeks. I have not felt any effects what so ever. It only serves to make me vomit nearly every morning. Libido is zero. This only adds to my anxiety and depression. It is also very expensive costing me nearly $450 a month. If I felt just a little better I would not mind spending the money. Drug companies just suck!  For the money this med is just not worth it and I will request another anti depressant from my MD at my next visit"
