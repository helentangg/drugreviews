"ANXIETY/PANIC ATTACKS/INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS/DEPRESSION. Thought I&#039;d state the things I had been suffering from quite severely, rather than choose one category! I normally don&#039;t post things like this, but I was once too in the same position as whoever is reading this, so want to help. I had been suffering with anxiety for years, along with panic attacks, and it all got worse when I started to have these so called &#039;intrusive thoughts&#039;, causing me to feel very depressed. I was very skeptical about taking any kind of medication, BUT I have to admit sertraline helped me get back on track of being ME AGAIN! It took a week or two to kick in at all, before then I was having the not so nice side effects, BUT JUST KEEP WITH IT! Been on it for 2 months."
