"I had the 5HTTLPR biomarker and CYP450 genotyping tests from a blood draw (which can help doctors determine how antidepressants are metabolized by your specific genetics and help predict which medications may be most beneficial as well as how long it may take for you to notice results), and was prescribed Effexor based on that info. It has helped me GREATLY for 6 months so far."
