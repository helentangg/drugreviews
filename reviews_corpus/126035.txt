"Been on antidepressants since around 1991 after I had thyroid removed.  Taking Wellbutrin for depression which works okay but last year started having late night anxiety attacks.  Really bad Fear.  I don&#039;t understand why.  Had me walking the streets at 11PM.  Started Viibryd and had weight gain and stomach issues and by the time I got to 40mg the anxiety just stopped! This medicine does as advertised for me, it stops the anxiety. That&#039;s what I needed and that&#039;s what I got. Like a miracle."
