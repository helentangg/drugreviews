"I have had panic attacks for 10 years,  I&#039;ve been extremely scared of trying medication but I finally got desperate enough to try citalopram. It&#039;s been nearly 2 months since I started and I have yet to feel any relief whatsoever. Started with 10mg then upped to 20mg. I&#039;m thinking about quitting."
