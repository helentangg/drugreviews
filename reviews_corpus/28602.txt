"Last year I broke out in hives all over my body from an allergic reaction.  Had panic attacks and suffered from anxiety - tingling in head, crazy numbness and so on, all anxiety symptoms, made me feel like I was going crazy. Lexapro has been a miracle medicine for me. I&#039;ve been taking it for about 6 months.  I feel so much more calm and no more anxiety symptoms or panic attacks."
