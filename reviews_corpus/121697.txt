"I have been on Venlafaxine for 20  years started on the tablet then changed to the MR capsules. nearly gave up on them as side effects were bad but stuck with them and they were a hugh help specially the slow release capsules, now however my gp change me back to the tablets as the capsules were too expensive for the practise to prescribe. I&#039;m now on 75mg twice a day and I&#039;m finding that for a couple of hours after taking I&#039;m on a high and everything is right with the world but the hours between are really bad, also if you forget to take a tablet the withdraw symtoms are horrific stomach cramps, vomiting, migraine headache, shakes to name a few.  No such problem with the slow release capsules so if your Dr prescribes venlafaxine ask for the MR"
