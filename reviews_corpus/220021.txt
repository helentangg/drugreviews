"I have fibromyalgia and suffered with anxiety and migraines also menopause is setting in. More recently I had an mri and they also found a syrinx ( cyst  like in my spinal cord) in the neck area. I have taken anti depessants before and have reacted badly too them. Amitryptiline 10mg at night was offered to me to help with sleep and pain. It&#039;s great, I sleep through no more toilet trips or lying awake all night. I have an interest in life again I had become quite house bound but I&#039;m up and about even walked round town which I haven&#039;t done in years. It&#039;s only a small dose and it&#039;s worked brilliantly."
