"I am going on 3 weeks of using the generic citalopram and the side effects are awful. I have major migraines that make me dizzy. I wake in the middle of the night covered in sweat, hot and cold chills, excessive tiredness even if I get sleep. I felt better for a short time but now I seem to have to talk myself into doing anything that requires me to leave my house, and I get shaky."
