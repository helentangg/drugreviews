"After about 6 weeks of taking Celexa I actually had no urge to pull my hair or eyelashes. After 8 months, all of my eyelashes and hair have grown back.  The main side- effect for me is dry mouth. It has given me a break from the horrible suffering caused by this disease. I feel like a human instead of a freak."
