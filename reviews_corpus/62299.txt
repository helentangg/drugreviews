"I am a 32 year old man, and for more than 17 years I have battled depression.  Had been living with depression so long that I could recognize the beginning symptom and would try to mentally prepare myself for the storm that was sure to follow.  After being hospitalized, I eventually found myself before a Psych. Doctor. I was afraid and kind of ashamed. Depression set in again.  TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT:  I have been taking Celexa for 4 days now, and I&#039;m all smiles.  I still experience all my emotions, but life finally feels bearable and not as heavy.  Thank you Celexa!"
