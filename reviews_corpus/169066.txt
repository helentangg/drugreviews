"Third week on Viibryd--been on 40 mg for five days. I was on Lexapro but it seemed to poop out or my post-partum depression was too much for the maximum dose. Definitely did not like the diarrhea side effect as I have major stomach problems, but it does go away. I feel pretty good. Before the Viibryd I was experiencing weepiness and major panic attacks. Feel much less depressed and anxious. It seems to be working. Sleeping better too. I&#039;ve been on antidepressants for 20 years (Zoloft, Celexa, Effexor, Lexapro). Hope this one keeps doing what it&#039;s doing."
