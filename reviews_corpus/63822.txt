"I was on Cipralex for 3 years and it destroyed my life. I lost 3 years of my life leaving school and doing nothing but sit at home worthless. Then I switched to Zoloft, I felt better on Zoloft but still the same complaint of being a &ldquo;zombie&rdquo;. I have never felt it is me for the past 10 years. I had tried getting off these drugs so many times but everytime I do it I feel better for the first few months then I collapse, again. It is very hard to be on them, and to be off them at the same time. My advice for you is to try them at last. Never start with antidepressants. Thank you and good luck."
