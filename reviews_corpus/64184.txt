"I have been on this medication for two days and I have had a significant improvement in obsessive thoughts and my anxiety. I had insomnia last night, but I heard that subsides. I have tons of energy and want to go do things I had lost interest in doing. I don&#039;t know if this is just going to be in the beginning, but I have read it only gets better. I have a little nausea, but I have stomach problems as well so I&#039;m used to it. I will put an update later on. I am going to stick this out!
