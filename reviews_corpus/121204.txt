"I&#039;ve been taking 75mg of effexor (the generic one, vena something) for about a month now and I Love It. After several years on Well-Butrin, this is so much better. Wellbutrin I think made my anxiety much worse. I was only on 150mg of it. When my Dr gave me 300mg of it I had a horrible reaction and was moody and mean and awful. Effexor is such a relief. It helps so much. I feel better than I&#039;ve felt in years, seriously. I started working out, I&#039;m less over emotional, I&#039;m not depressed. I don&#039;t fly off the handle when I&#039;m upset now. I feel like I can finally deal with things better. I also suffer with severe PMDD which makes me a miserable and angry person for 2 days a month and effexor has helped tremendously."
