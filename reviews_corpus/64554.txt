"I have been on Zoloft for 5 months now after being on my terrible Paxil (started at 50mg, then 100mg, now 150mg...zoloft) and I had to sleep 16 hours a day, and after being awake for 6 hours I&#039;d need to go back to sleep....that&#039;s the bad side. 

The good side is is that my Obsessiveness and compulsions and depression and GAD are WAY down! :)...and my psychiatrist additionally put me on Wellbutrin XL 150mg and (nicknamed &quot;Welloft&quot;) and has had amazing results for my depression and energy level."
