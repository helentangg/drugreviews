"I don&#039;t remember since when I stated to have insomnia , usually it takes me 2+ hours to fall asleep , and I always wake up a few times at night . I tried to do excercies to make myself tired , still no improvement on my sleeping . Things even got worse recently , I went to my doctor and he put me on Amitriptyline 10mg . Omg , it work so well , the first day I took , I had slept like 10hours (was at weekend ) .  I am on my third week with Amitriptyline, my doctor prescribed me only for a month , I don&#039;t know if I can sleep well without it after a month . But this medicine makes me very calm and happy everyday because I can sleep well and wake up every morning refreshed ."
