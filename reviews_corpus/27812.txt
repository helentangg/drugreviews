"This is a great drug.  I had battled depression my entire adult life and after a year of completely changing my diet, supplements, routine and seeing several counsellors I finally gave this a try.  IT CHANGED MY LIFE.  I can&#039;t believe I waited so long.  I used to spin in a tizzy over things.  I now realize I have control and stay calm.

Unfortunately I experienced many side effects with Lexapro.  I had nausea in the beginning, shortness of breath and fatigue.  I did not gain weight, which I was grateful for.  

Ultimately I switched to Prozac because this made me too tired, but I would recommend this over Prozac for most people because it supposedly has less side effects (though not for me)."
