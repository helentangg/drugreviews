"I had a very bad experience on setraline started taking 50 mg daily increased to 100mg, have never felt so ill.  I couldn&#039;t leave the house so anxious, couldn&#039;t eat, felt sick all the time, couldn&#039;t concentrate and very depressed, cut down the dose over 10 days and stopped but had to go onto beta blockers to controll my anxiety, now cutting them down to come off those too, back on old antidepressant escitrapram and feeling a lot better. I will never take sertraline again."
