"If you&#039;re suffering, you need to fix you! This medication is the most important thing to ever happen in my life. I went from a nervous, neurotic, obsessional wreck, to calm, cool and in-control dude - and I only take 5-10 mg (I&#039;m 6&#039; 4&quot;). Over the last seven years, I&#039;ve taken it on average 1-2 months out of the year - only when needed and never more than 6-8 weeks. I prefer not to be on anything, but when my health and business decline because of my mood, I immediately break the safety glass and reach for the Lexapro. And if for some reason Lexapro doesn&#039;t work for you, work with your doctor to find the right medicine so you can feel better. (I&#039;ve tried 6 different medicines, we all have different chemistries - never give up."
