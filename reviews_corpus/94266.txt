"I was under a lot of stress and anxiety from work and a difficult relationship. My doctor prescribed Brintellix for me. He gave me samples for 1 month. I have only been on Prozac briefly in the past for about 8 months many years ago. Only recently I have had symptoms of stress and anxiety. This medication seems to work for me. I had insomnia before I started taking it so it&#039;s not from the meds, but I feel so much better. Now I want to fill the prescription, but my insurance doesn&#039;t cover it and it costs $274.00. I simply cannot afford it, otherwise I would continue to use it. No side effects whatsoever, except for some bad dreams."
