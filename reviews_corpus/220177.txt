"After one year on this I haven&#039;t felt anything good or bad I took a vacation and forgot it at home and went without it for about three weeks and I didn&#039;t feel any different and when I told my doctor about this. If I could stop taking it  he told me no I should take it before bedtime even if it does not do anything. So what gives ??"
