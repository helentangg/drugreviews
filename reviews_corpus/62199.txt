"I began taking this medication and it made a huge difference. After a few weeks I started to feel like my old self again. I started on 10mg and after a few months my doctor increased to 20mgs. Initially the side effects were just headaches and excessive yawning. But hey, what&#039;s a head ache compared to depression and anxiety? It took 7 months for the bad side effects to kick in. I started forgetting things. Having zero recollection of things I had done. I seemed to be writing things out of order which has never been an issue with me. I&#039;d do things like have a piece of trash in one hand and my car keys in the other and go to a trash can to throw the trash away and put my keys in there instead of the trash! Unfortunately have to stop this medicine."
