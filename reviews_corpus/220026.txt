"I highly highly highly recommend using this medicine in treating and managing your IBS symptoms. I&#039;ve been on it less than a month and with a combination of the medicine and a diet (staying away from fatty foods, fried foods, soda, chocolate and eating lots of fruit) I have found relief I thought I&#039;d never find. I&#039;m 18 years old and I&#039;ve had my fair share of history in battling these symptoms, it was rough but with this medicine, it became a lot easier."
