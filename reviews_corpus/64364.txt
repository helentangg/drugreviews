"This medication does work. I had been through a lot of stress at work for 3 years and finally decided to start taking 50 mg of sertraline. I didn&#039;t have any side effects and within two weeks I noticed that I am finally calm and &quot;happy&quot;. Nothing bothered me anymore. In a month after I started taking the medication I was laid off. I didn&#039;t even cry. It was a shock though so I checked with my doc and she advised to increase the dose to 75 mg. I was taking it for about three months and started feeling emotionally numb and it seemed that the med stopped working. Also my hands/fingers were &quot;falling asleep&quot; at night and from holding an iPhone for more than 2-3 min. They still do. I am on 150 mg and my mood is fine. its been 13 months altogether."
