"My husband had been on every drug and drug combo available- nothing worked for his anger, depression and crippling anxiety. This has been a GOD-SEND! After 24 years of marriage, I finally feel like I found the loving, kind man I fell in love with. No side effects at all, much more stable moods, and soundly sleeping at night. He also takes Seroquel at bedtime."
