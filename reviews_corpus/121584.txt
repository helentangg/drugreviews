"In the last year I had a diagnosis of myofacial pain syndrome, now its fibromyalgia.  I am not convinced HMO doctor knows.  Other than pain I have a variety of other symptoms, just none are mental health related.   I have been told to take up to 225mg but now reduced in last week to 75 mg before I read of the withdrawal symptoms.  So far I am fine but am concerned now that I might be overwhelmed reducing under 75 mg.   Doing this on own since doctor said it is up to me."
