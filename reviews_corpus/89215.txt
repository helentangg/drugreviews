"I have been on this medication for a week, after switching from Zoloft.  My doctor started me on 20mg.  I made the mistake of immediately going online to read reviews.  Instead, my advice is to let the medication start to take effect.  You will make yourself feel worse if you read the negative reviews.  I can say that one week on this medication has turned out better than my previous medication.  Everyone is different, so I think I found the one that works. Initially, you may have some insomnia, but it will pass once you start to feel more relaxed.  I did have some tingly feelings in the hands, but that passed after day 4.  I felt a head rush of sorts the first 5-6 days, where I felt high, but it too passed for me."
