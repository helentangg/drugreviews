"Been on for a few months - up to 40mg - feeling great as far as mood goes.  DO have some break through anxiety but that will get better with time.  Notice you DO HAVE TO TAKE WITH FOOD - or your stomach does get really upset.  I have also noticed weight gain/or bloating.  So the weight gain being 10 pounds may be some water weight as well.  I&#039;ve taken other meds that don&#039;t work this effectively so will give this a definite try for awhile and see if it continues to help me with my mood disorder.  Bless all out there that have this terrible disorder...."
