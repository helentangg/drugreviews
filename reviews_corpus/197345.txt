"I first took Paxil in high school for minor depression but weaned myself off of it in college. About a year later I began having awful, day-long panic attacks which caused me to take two months off from school. So back on the Paxil I went, knowing that I would probably be taking it for life. I have tried several other medicines as well, but they didn&#039;t work for me. Paxil is the only thing that makes me feel &quot;normal&quot; and clear-headed. If I don&#039;t take it for a couple of days I do start feeling a little light-headed and anxious, so I wouldn&#039;t ever quit cold-turkey. I recommend trying a few different medicines if the first ones aren&#039;t a perfect fit, everyone is unique, and Paxil works for me."
