"I&#039;m on my 3rd day. My mood seems to have mellowed out a bit. I&#039;m not as moody as I normally am. I don&#039;t have the itchy skin but I have been experiencing a bit of nausea. This is my first time being on antidepressants and I really hope this gets me out of the funk I&#039;ve been in the last 6 months. I got a 3 week sample supply and haven&#039;t submitted my prescription yet to see if insurance will cover what my physician describes it as &quot;the designer antidepressant&quot;."
