"I started taking Prozac 9 weeks ago after Mirtazapine stopped working. I was suffering with bad OCD, anxiety and panic attacks on a daily basis. 
When I first started on the medication, I thought it would be a miracle drug, however the side effects were horrendous. For 7 solid weeks I was a mess, I was depressed (I dont even suffer with depression) I was crying at my desk all the time, I had horrible thoughts, crippling anxiety, would not leave my house or talk to anyone the only thing that would get me through the day was Diazapam.
I am on 40mg and after 7 weeks it was like a light turned on and I have been &#039;normal&#039; for 2 weeks straight, I am so happy I stuck with it. I know it&#039;s hard but trust me it&#039;s worth it."
