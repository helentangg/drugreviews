"Prozac is my happy pill, it took me forever to find something that works, but this is definitely mine!! I was beginning to be skeptical that anything would work.. Effexor and Prestiq was what I was put on before this, and that was a nightmare... This makes me think more clearly and see things in a different perspective, I see the good in life, and I don&#039;t get so easily upset over everything anymore, and if I do get bothered by something, I get over it in seconds... Helps with my social anxiety as well.. I&#039;ve noticed I&#039;m more talkative, and can deal with being around people better, before I was so badly depressed with possible bipolar or personality disorder.. I&#039;m finally getting to know myself as a person and am much happier now."
