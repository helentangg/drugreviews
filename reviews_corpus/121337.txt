"I was prescribed 37.5 mg. daily to deal with the trifecta of anxiety, hot flashes and sleeplessness.  I&#039;m finding that the hot flashes have greatly decreased and that while I still wake up during the night, I am able to get back to sleep.  My anxiety is still there but is finally manageable and I&#039;m okay with that.  I am happy to have some relief with this dosage and will not increase it unless absolutely necessary.  The side effects that I am experiencing  are dry mouth, constipation and a little weight gain but I am willing to deal with this in order not to suffer as I had for so long.  I take meds with breakfast and did notice that if I forget a dose, I am unable to sleep that night."
