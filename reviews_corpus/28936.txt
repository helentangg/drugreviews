"I have tried four different anti-depressants. All, apart from Lexapro, caused intolerable insomnia. I have now taken Lexapro for 3 years and found it to be life altering. I now feel &quot;normal&quot; and my sleep patterns have improved remarkably. My only side effect is slight sexual difficulties, however these have lessened over time."
