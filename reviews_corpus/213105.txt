"I suffered with extremely severe social anxiety for 16 years (early teens - 30). I had experienced episodes of fear that were so bad that I would feel a strong urge (if not need) to &quot;escape&quot; from the situation (turning my head the other way, or making a hurried exit, cutting the conversation off, having to turn around and walk out of an office doorway that I had just started to walk into). Nardil turned my life around, I was like a new person: talkative, extroverted, able to feel at-ease and laugh, make jokes, fully calm and relaxed, AND happy! I was finally the person I was always meant to be. I can say it truly saved my life. Side-effects DO lessen and even disappear, so be patient. I take 75mg/day, have not needed to increase in 6 years!"
