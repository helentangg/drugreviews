"After reading all the reviews and trying just about everything under the sun, I have found something that works for my lower back pain.

I was in a car accident when I was 14 and broke my L4&amp;5, since then I have been dealing with back pain (I am now 40).

Last year my Dr. Discussed cymbalta with me. After doing some research I decided to give it a whirl, I was almost turned off the idea due to some of the negative experiences...glad I tried it.

I am currently pain free, I did experience some side effects all of which dissapeared before 5 months;
Excessive yawning
Not being able to ejaculate during sex
Feeling of tiredness
Some anxiety
Sweats
Weight gain
Vivid dreams
kept peeing a little after I thought I was done

Give it time, if you try!"
