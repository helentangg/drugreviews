"I started taking this med six days ago to treat neuropathy pain in my feet and lower legs. It, like gabapentin that I was taking before this, is giving me severe arthritis pain in my hands and knees, which I did not have before. I will discontinue the use today. It stopped the neuropathic pain but is crippling me in other ways. I will go back to treatments with NSAIDS and acetaminophen."
