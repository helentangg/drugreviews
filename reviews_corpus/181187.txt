"I was so depressed and I started this medicine without expecting that after 15 days I  am like I&#039;ve taken ecstasy. I am full of energy I don&#039;t hesitate to be myself! I love being my self actually! I&#039;m not thinking anymore about cocaine, weed and stuff like that cause that was the main reason that I needed a doctor!  THANK U PROZAC"
