"My doctor started me off with 10mg then two weeks after I went up to 20mg. I feel great and my depression is gone. However, ive been on it for a month and a half and find that I can&#039;t sleep. Before celexa I was sleeping too much and now I cant sleep unless I recreationally take xanax. Now my anxiety is high because I can&#039;t sleep and when I do sleep it&#039;s because of xanax which makes me sleep for 12 hours and then I wake up late and I&#039;m unmotivated to do anything. Should I see my doctor for this? I love xanax cause it makes me feel better for my anxiety a night but I&#039;m scared I&#039;ll start abusing it especially since I don&#039;t have a prescription."
