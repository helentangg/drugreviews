"I started taking celexa over a year ago for anxiety and stress. I had some mild side effects the first week, but it has been great since then. I started on 10mg and switched to 20mg after a month and have been at that prescription since. It probably took at least a month before I started noticing a difference. I take it at night and don&#039;t have any troubles sleeping or any other side effects. This medicine has completely changed my perspective. I&#039;m much more calm and just happier all around. I used to be very high strung and easily stressed, but not anymore! Highly recommend!"
