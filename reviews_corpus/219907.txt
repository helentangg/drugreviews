"I was very curious to know has anyone here been to a sleep specialist or even had a couple sleep labs done? I&#039;m familiar with all meds mentioned. If I had not been down that long road, I wouldn&#039;t know their names. I was bounced around with this med and that and combinations (as I have pain and other issues as well) Not until I had 2 sleep studies done, and after 4 yrs seeing a Neurologist who specializes in insomnia, narcolepsy, sleep apnea. He also has a Phd in Pulmonology but doesnt practice that any longer. There are definitive reasons why different people sleep or don&#039;t, how long, feel rested, or not.
The body as is was meant to be awake approx. 15 hrs and asleep approx. 8-9 hrs. I would like to share some things that may help. K"
