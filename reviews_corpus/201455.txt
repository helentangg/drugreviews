"I have always struggled with intrusive thoughts that manifest in various forms (obsession with being &quot;perfect&quot;, eating disorders, social anxiety, etc.) But for several years of my adult life, I wanted help so bad because I was miserable... Just completely uncomfortable &amp; restless with anxiety that would come and go but stayed with me much longer than it would stay away. I tried talking to local counselors &amp; was very disappointed, as they were not educated on OCD. After a year of no luck with counselors, I found one (university counselor) who knew what I was going through &amp; how to help me. Life is SO much better! I started at 50mg &amp; currently take 200mg"
