"My psychiatrist utilized every combination you can think of and finally Nardil. While I am very careful about foods and wear a medic alert bracelet and carry an alert in my purse that NO Demerol can be given as it can cause death, I finally feel better from a deep depressive state since October 2008.  My memory state however has not improved but my physical state has and I can at least get out of bed and be somewhat sociable with friends and family. I have had a very positive experience with it so far."
