"Just took my first dose 5 mg of Brintellix - have been on every possible medication including Wellbutrin for 15 years, Seroquel for 9 years, Lexapro for 2 years, just weaned off Lexapro.  I feel quite odd, butterflies in stomach and brain fog - my daughter has been on Brintellix for 2 months and is still vomiting - if this continues, another failed med."
