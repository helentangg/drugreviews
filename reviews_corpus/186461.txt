"Been on Pristiq for a month now changing from Cymbalta. Cymbalta did nothing for me, Pristiq is starting to help. Have had unresponsive major depression along which chronic anxiety for 5 years now. Have tried so many antidepressants of which none were effective for the depression and anxiety. But had a huge serving of various side effects as most mentioned.

Now, Anxiety under limited control, depression is lifting but is hard to say how much. I had forgotten what &quot;normal&quot;  feels like. So far P is helping but a long way to Go."
