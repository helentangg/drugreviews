"I was taking 50mg of Zoloft a day for two months and it made me even more irritable and down. I didn&#039;t want to do anything. When I did force myself to go out and socialize I&#039;d snap at people. Nothing was fun. Nothing seemed to be worth doing. I&#039;ve tried both Lexapro and Zoloft. Neither have made me feel any better. I got worse on both. I don&#039;t always want to feel depressed, but at least off of medication I have the ability to hide my feelings from people, not to place other people under the weight of my moods, but on those two medications I didn&#039;t even feel like I had the power to fake it. Zoloft also gave me migraines, ones that would last for a week straight. Glad it works for some people though."
