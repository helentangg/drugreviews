"So I have been on amitriptyline for a little over a year and it did work wonders for migraine prevention but there are alot of down sides to this medication that the doctors don&#039;t make clear. It causes sugar and carb cravings like crazy you never feel full it&#039;s addictive and you can form a tolerance to it which causes you to have to go up in dose every once in a while. I have slowly grown to hate it because I personally have gained 40 pounds in less than a year taking this medication. I&#039;ve noticed lately that it hasn&#039;t been working as well for my migraines signalling an increase in dose. I am going to try a different medication because I&#039;m already taking 100mg of this one and I can&#039;t deal with the cravings and weight gain!"
