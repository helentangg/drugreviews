"I suffer from SAD and in the winter it sometimes felt like I could actually feel the darkness, especially on dreary days. I&#039;ve been on Lexapro for 3 years and it has worked great. I only feel a tinge of &quot;heaviness&quot; if it stays dreary for several days, but even then it is nothing like it used to be."
