"This is the only antidepressant that has ever worked for me. I feel like me again, been about 10 years since I have felt this good.  am back to keeping my house clean and very happy not Debbie downer anymore. I am positive about anything. I have never been this stable in my life, but I have noticed weight loss and am glad as I was over 320lbs now 290lbs and am glad my health is better all around."
