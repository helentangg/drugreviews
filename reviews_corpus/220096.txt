"I&#039;ve suffered from migraines, mostly chronic,  going on 6 years. I had originally tried Amitriptyline  at the beginning of my diagnosis; however, quickly got off of it (I don&#039;t remember why). 6 years later and a new doctor suggested we give it a try. Almost immediately I noticed my eyes changing. Very blurred vision. I also experienced rapid weight gain, hostility, aggression and more sweating. Within three weeks of being on the medicine, I called my doctor and had them get me off of it. Now I am on nortriptyline. Glad because I soon after received notification from my insurance that they wouldn&#039;t cover the suggested amount of 50 mg, only 25 mg for 30 days."
