"Diagnosed with Major Depression.  Started using this drug after taking Lexapro, Zoloft and Elavil.  I suffered from nausea when this medication was taken without food.  I was told that I would experience diarrhea as an initial side effect; however, this became chronic.  I missed one dose (after being on this medication and taking it consistently at the same time of day each day for four months) and had a major crying fit- to the extent that my nose started bleeding.  I have been switched to Brintellix as the side effects of this medication were too extreme."
