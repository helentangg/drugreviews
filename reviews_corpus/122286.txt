"Very effective. Diagnosed bipolar type II. Helps a lot with atypical depression type symptoms, like lethargy and slow thought processes. Messes up my sleep though, and can make me a bit cranky and irritable. Anyone know how to deal with the insomnia? I find it hard to fall asleep, and do not want to take benzodiazepines due to the addictive properties."
