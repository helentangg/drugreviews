"I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder just a few months ago. I&#039;m 25 and let me say this medicine works great. I could tell a difference within the first week and my husband (whom I was driving absolutely crazy) saw a huge change too. I feel happier now and the &quot;manicness&quot; has gone away. I have noticed the weight loss but not too much. I was weighing in at 160lbs and now I&#039;m down to 150lbs so 10 lbs in the past 2 months is good. My sex life is back to normal where I hope it will stay. I feel like a better mother and wife now, all because of Pristiq."
