"I have suffered with anxiety and severe depression for years. I had tried group therapy as well as one on one sessions with a psychiatrist but it was not much help. I would sit at a meeting or in a class and look normal but I would be going crazy inside with my thoughts racing out of control, and this would last nonstop for days. It also made social situations extremely difficult. My doc put me on Sertraline first at 25m and upped it to 50m after a month. Except for a bit of nausea I had almost no side effects and after about three weeks I started to notice some subtle changes. I&#039;ve been on it going on four months now and I feel like a new person! I&#039;m much more in control and my days now are calm and much happier. If u can relate plz try it"
