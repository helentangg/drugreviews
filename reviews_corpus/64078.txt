"I took this for 3 days and felt like a zombie.Doctor gave me this to help me focus for school rather than a narcotic. Needless to say it didn&#039;t help I feel like complete garbage. I have had a headache no appetite, insomnia, and hot flashes this stuff is awful! Im just going to be non focused rather than try and find something this isn&#039;t worth it!"
