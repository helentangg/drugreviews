"Started more as supplement to wellbutrin.  But I got more from this so I quit wellbutrin and take this at 20mg.  feel great.  Calm and clear.  Focused and motivated.  Side effects were mild...vivid dreams and absolutely zero appetite.  Eat lunch and thats it.  Not hungry the rest of the day.  Great for motivation and clarity."
