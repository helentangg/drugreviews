"I had been taking brintellix for a few months. 20Mg and it was working great. I have pretty severe depression and everyone said they saw a positive change in me. But it started making my stomach hurt, I told the dr and we decided it was worth the stomach ache because it was really helping. When I started throwing up and feeling nauseous 24/7 I had to stop it. Been off for a couple weeks and still feel very sick."
