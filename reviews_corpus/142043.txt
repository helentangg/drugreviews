"I&#039;ve been on lexapro for about a year - finally went on something after waiting way too long.  It works well, and I definitely feel better, but I&#039;m not sure it&#039;s the best medication for the costs/side effects vs benifits.  I had problems with my menstrual cycle and it was making me physically ill.  I had to switch to a different BCP to get it straightened out.   I also think that I need a higher dose than 10mg.  It is helping, but I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s helping enough."
