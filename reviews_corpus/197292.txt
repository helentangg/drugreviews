"I was diagnosed with severe depression.  I am 61 years old, and I had no previous problems.  I started on Paxil 14 months ago.  It took 3 months to take full effect.  My doctor started me on 20 mg and then 30 mg to kick start it, and it worked.  I tried to wean off, but I went too fast.  I just went back to 30 mg a day (20/9pm 10/7am) a week ago.  It hasn&#039;t taken full effect yet.  I would recommend Paxil, but realize that this medication is very slow to work and dosage changes take time.  Everyone is different.  It has helped me, but it has been a long road."
