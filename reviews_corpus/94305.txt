"After 4 months I thought I was doing quite well on 10mg Brintellix until I had very bad headaches.  MRI imaging demonstrated I had constricted  blood vessels in my brain a second test showed it had reversed itself. My neurologist strongly advised I discontinue this med because SSRI antidepressants can trigger Reversible Vasoconstriction Syndrome which can cause strokes and brain bleeds.  I started Wellbutrin XL 150mg which doesn&#039;t target serotoin I&#039;m told.  I&#039;m not doing as well and sometimes think about taking a chance and restarting Brintellix and at least have a better quality of life!  Depression sucks!"
