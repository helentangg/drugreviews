"Oops! I had put my review under the wrong category. Long story short- I got a concussion and was unexpectedly bed-ridden and in the dark both metaphorically and literally for almost 3 months. Migraines wracked me every day among other symptoms- it was basically hell on earth. My doctor prescribed me 25 mg of amitriptyline, said most of his concussion patients had a lot of success with it. Anyway, it gave me my life back. I&#039;ve been on it for 4 mnths now... I don&#039;t get aura migraines anymore, head aches now are duller and infrequent :) Dry mouth, a little more constipation, had some depressed feelings when I first started but my body adjusted. I really do recommend this! Give yourself enough hours to sleep at first."
