"This medicine saved my life. I like others, didn&#039;t want to take an anti-depressant. I honestly didn&#039;t think it would help. My marriage was having problems which was the cause of my depression. I thought I would never feel good again. Then my doctor put me on citalopram. Within a couple of weeks I couldn&#039;t believe it. Problem was still there but I picked myself up and decided I could face it. My attitude and demeanor changed. I decided to fight for it - and because I was my old self again, I was able to make my husband remember who he fell in love with.  I was very very close to not trying this pill and I would like to encourage anyone else who thinks nothing will help to give this a try."
