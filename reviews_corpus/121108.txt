"I have been taking Effexor on and off for the past 10 years.  There is no better medicine for my anxiety than Effexor.  The trick with Effexor XR is that you need to know exactly how to take it and not to take more than what you really need.  I am now on a steady 37.5mg (minimum dose) and it works just fine.  My doctor tells me that that low dose is hardly therapeutic but it works just fine for me.  Of course I need to practice many anxiety relief techniques, especially the ones that help get you back to sleep, but overall, Effexor XR at 37.5 mg each morning takes the severe edge off my condition, I do the rest.
It&#039;s a good mix."
