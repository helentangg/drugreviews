"I started sertraline 4 years ago and it has honestly helped my GAD so much! I still get panic attacks from time to time but that&#039;s my mind running away with me, and I&#039;m only on the lowest dose of sertraline. I wouldn&#039;t have the confidence that I have today without this drug, and I certainly wouldn&#039;t be a good mother to my son, I would have no doubt been a depressed mess. This has helped me see that there is a life outside of GAD and depression, no matter how hard it is to find...keep going. It&#039;s there."
