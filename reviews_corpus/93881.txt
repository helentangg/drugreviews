"My doctor gave me samples. Went from Zoloft to Trintellix. Let&#039;s just say, this has not been a good experience. I have a tough stomach but everytime I take this medicine I&#039;m to the point of vomiting. Tried taking it before bed, definitely not a good idea either. Up vomiting too. I did see a small boost in energy though.. but with all the sickness, I would have to say taking this is not worth it."
