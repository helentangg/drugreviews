"I&#039;ve had wicked panic attacks, anxiety and now panic disorder. I&#039;ve tried the breathing, distractions, calming music and all that. Only thing that really worked was praying and listening to Christian music. But that didn&#039;t do it completely so I went back to the Dr when my latest one caused me to lose my job. I was scared to death to try Zoloft after all the reviews saying things get worse before better and I naturally freak out any time I try any new medication. But, I&#039;ve been on the 25 mg for about a week and just went to 50. I&#039;ve had absolutely no side effects other than my brain trying to lie to me, if you know what I mean. I also take .50 mg Xanax with it and I take it at night so I believe that helps. I feel so much better."
