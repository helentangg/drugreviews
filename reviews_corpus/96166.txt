"I&#039;ve only been using it for 4 days.  Nausea was the major side effect and sleeping extremely well.  The third day I got diarrhea which was a less pleasant side effect.  I am 32 years old and my doctor started me on 50mg/ 1x daily.  I have not had any heart palpitations or irregular heart beat since taking the medication.  (I was having them before I started).  I seem calmer, I feel a bit happier.  My doctor recommended me using Zoloft (I&#039;m taking the generic) because I was having panic attacks nearly every day.  I hope it works as well for me as others, so far the side effects don&#039;t outweigh the benefits."
