"After years of messing around with various diets, pills, etc - and getting down to 125 lbs (I&#039;m a 51 year old male, 5&#039;9&quot;) - Elavil has apparently cured my IBS-D.  I still avoid dairy and spicy food (also have GERD) - but basically, I&#039;m cured.  I&#039;ve also gained 25 lbs - which is actually too much.  It does seem to increase your appetite.  But - that&#039;s a trade-off I&#039;m willing to make.  I have no idea why I wasn&#039;t given this med by my GI guy.  I was actually given it by my PCP for Anxiety, and I wanted something that wouldn&#039;t make my IBS-D worse."
