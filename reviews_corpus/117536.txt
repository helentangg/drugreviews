"I&#039;ve suffered from migraines for 25 + years. I had my first appointment with a headache specialist /neurologist this month and she started me on nortriptyline 10 mg, 1 x day for a week and step up to 30 mg daily. That was a Monday. I had a severe migraine from Monday night until Saturday as my last dose was Thur night and headache carried over into Friday. Saturday was much better. I also experienced a terrible pressure in my neck and head like my BP was elevated (normally my BP is great unless I&#039;m in pain). I was incredibly irritable as well. After stopping nortriptyline, the daily headache issue subsided as well as the pressure in neck and head. I still have migraines and will find something else. In short.... No. I won&#039;t take it again."
