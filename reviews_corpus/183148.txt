"Took Cymbalta for close to a year for Fibro symptoms.  For the first couple months it seemed to be helping, and then it stopped.  I had worsening sleep difficulty, violent mood swings, and a variety of other side effects.  Even with all the Fibro symptoms, I feel better off the med than I ever felt on it.  It was also expensive."
