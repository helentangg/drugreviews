"Was on antidepressants/ADHD meds for about 10 years.  GAD, mild depression, OCD and ADHD.  I stopped taking all meds and been off for a couple years.  I have always had some GAD and poor focus. With work and school my stress level went up, then the obsessive thoughts/GAD went up and mood went down.  I didn&#039;t like other antidepressants due to insomnia and that numb/disconnected human feeling you get with them.  I have been on Viibryd 10mg for one week and I was pleasantly surprised at not feeling the numb feeling.  I do have mild gastrointestinal symptoms of bloating and gas.  Stools a little loose but not diarrhea.  I feel great in respect to mood and obsessive worry is way down.  Will try 20mg, won&#039;t go past 20mg after reading reviews."
