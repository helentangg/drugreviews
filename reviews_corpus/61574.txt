"I have been taking 50mg of Citalopram daily for about two years now for GAD and depression and have made a significant improvement in all aspects of my life.

I have however experienced several side effects:
Lethargy/Fatigue
Loss of Concentration
Memory Loss
Yawning
Nightmares
Increased Sweating
Insomnia
Augmented Essential Tremor

I think the overall efficacy of the drug outweighs the relatively minor side effects."
