"Zoloft works for me. I&#039;ve tried other medicines, and had too many unfavorable side effects. Zoloft has just sort of evened me out. I can cope now, with therapy of course. I&#039;d recommend Zoloft for anyone who has bad side effects from other medicines, and who is getting therapy too. I&#039;m on a high dose, and my doctor wants to start weaning me off soon, so the therapy is key, I think."
