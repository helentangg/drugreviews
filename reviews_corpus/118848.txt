"I&#039;ve been taking Zoloft for maybe 2 months now.  I&#039;ve gradually gotten up to 200mg and notice a big change in my mood, after Lexapro wasn&#039;t cutting it anymore.  I have severe depression and I notice a big improvement.  So far, not many side effects besides fidgeting, I can&#039;t sit still for the life of me.  I&#039;ve also noticed that if I miss a dose of Lexapro, I didn&#039;t feel much different.  If I miss a dose of Zoloft, I become horribly agitated.  When I sleep that night, I have horribly vivid nightmares and cold sweats all throughout the night and rarely sleep.  I have also noticed a bit of decreased appetite and energy.  Overall, so far I&#039;m very happy with the results and hope I can continue on this path."
