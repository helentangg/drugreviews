"Only last few months been on fluoxetine and started on 20mg and then increased to 40mg a life saver.  Tried citalopram before and this made me feel heavy headed and a little lack of energy.  Got my life back and think I did the right thing and wont be coming off this for a while. People say if you break your leg or your body needs a operation you would go for it.  If you need to take a SSR for a while, do it to get your life back on a even keel."
