"I don&#039;t normally review anything but this time I thought I thought I should especially considering most people only tell you the negative experiences of a drug. I really didn&#039;t know my anxiety was bad until now. I know I had bad &quot;nerves&quot; is what I call it and I&#039;m normally on edge and get paranoid about almost everything especially my relationships. I got so used to being anxious that it became normal to the point that I forgot what the other side felt like. Strange but true statement. Effexor has allowed me to handle just about anything thrown at me. Yes I get a little anxious but over all I&#039;m ok. I did have bad gas and a headache but it got better totally worth a try."
