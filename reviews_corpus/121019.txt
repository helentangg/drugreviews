"Started 37.5 Effexor 2 weeks ago. Haven&#039;t really noticed any decrease in my pain level from fibromyalgia. Feel very foggy, drinking more coffee in the morning to clear my head. Not sleeping well at night, 3-4 hrs a night at most. I&#039;ve noticed a huge change in my vision, eyes are extremely dry during daytime when wearing my contacts but continuously watering at night. I don&#039;t think this  medicine is for me. Contacting Doctor about stopping. Very concerned about the withdrawals I&#039;m reading about...."
