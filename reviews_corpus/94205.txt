"I am a 64 year old female.  I have been on antidepressants since I was 13.  I have been diagnosed with PTSD, Bi-polar and major depressive disorder.  I felt most normal while taking Prozac, however, during the past ten years, I lost both parents, made a major move, and my husband was diagnosed with Alzheimer&#039;s.  The Prozac just didn&#039;t seem to be working.  My physician switched me to Wellbutrin,  and then to Cymbalta...the Cymbalta and my stomach didn&#039;t hit it off, so she put me on Brintellix.  I am very pleased with this medication.  I do have nausea, so I try to eat something before I take it.  I seem to be hot all of the time, some itching, and I have had a significant weight gain! Which is not listed as a side effect."
