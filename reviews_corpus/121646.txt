"I have been in Effexor for twelve years and it&#039;s been very effective until just recently. (I think my body has grown too used to it.) When it was still able to effect me, it was super useful. The bad part is that you&#039;ll suffer from withdrawal symptoms if you don&#039;t take it for over 24 hours. I ran out in college for FIVE DAYS (I lived in one city and my psychiatrist was in another) and I was miserable - chills, weird dreams, everything. Never let it run out and never forget to take it. Otherwise it&#039;s a good medicine."
