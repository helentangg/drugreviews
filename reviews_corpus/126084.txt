"I was put on this medication one month after it&#039;s FDA approval for Major Depressive Disorder. I was told it would probably take up to 3 weeks for a noticeable difference in my mood and behavior, but I noticed a difference on day 2. I felt like I was able to have emotions and feelings again. I was not as irritable or angry, and I felt like I had more energy and confidence. When I stepped up the doses I had the GI side effects, but those have  been resolved when My body adapted. I still get restless legs occasionally at night, and when I forget to take my medicine I get really itchy, irritable, and hazy. But the good outweighs the bad. I feel great! Try it!"
