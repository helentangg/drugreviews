"I have lived with Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder for almost 3 decades.  I was prescribed this wonderful pill to help me and I adore it!  My flow is now moderate to light for the first time since I started my cycle. I no longer have nausea inducing back cramps and my cycle has shortened from 6.5 days to 4.5 - 5 days.  Even better, my irritability has decreased and the Hulk no longer screams and runs from me in terror when I have my period.  
It is a relief to be free of uncontrollable irritability, awful cramps, heavy flow and depression.  "
