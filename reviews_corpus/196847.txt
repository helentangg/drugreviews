"I am a 31 year old female. Paroxatine definitely helped my mood but it made me lethargic and I gained about a kilo a month for the five months I was on it. I was unhappy about the weight gain so I tapered off very slowly and didn&#039;t have any serious side effects besides being a bit emotional for a week. Losing the weight seems to be harder than it was before I took the medication. It didn&#039;t help my mood anymore than sertraline or Effexor did and the side effects of those were far more tolerable than so much weight gain."
