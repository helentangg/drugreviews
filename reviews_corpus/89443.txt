"I didn&#039;t realize how bad my anxiety was until I started taking citalopram (and found relief).  I had never taken any antidepressant and I started off with a TINY amount..5 mg in the morning for the first three days.  I got a bad headache, which went away after a couple of days.  I then increased to 10mg... then 20.  I ended up at 40mg daily and have been on that for a little over a year.  

I am currently in the process of decreasing my dose.  I dropped down to 30 mg  for two weeks and I am noticing my irritation and anxiety increasing.  My goal had been to get to 20mg but I am not sure I&#039;ll be able to do that, due to the increased feelings of anxiety.  

All in all I have found this medicine to be a HUGE help with very few side effects."
