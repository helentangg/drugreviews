"I have been taking Viibryd for one year. I initially was suffering from anxiety, depression and alcohol abuse as I tried to escape from the feelings of living in a toxic marriage. I divorced and still felt very anxious and afraid of my ex-husband. Klonopin gave me immediate relief from the anxiety and I rarely have to take it anymore. I stopped drinking and have no desire for it at all.  I take 40 mg of Viibryd in the morning with a high protein breakfast. It has been VERY helpful. Regular exercise is key. I was unable to exercise for a few months due to an injury and had terrible cravings for sweets and carbs that resulted in 10 lb gain. That has gone away now that I am back to healthy eating and exercise. Diarrhea still a problem."
