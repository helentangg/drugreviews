"I&#039;m 18 and I had horrible PMDD from the first time I got my period. Depression, suicidal, panic attacks, uncontrollable anger. For two weeks my life would stop, I&#039;d take off from school and work and sit in my room for days on end. I went on fluxotene 20mg when I was 17 and it has changed my life! I&#039;ve suffered from a lot of mood swings and outbursts typical of a teenager, but mine were so out of control. Fluxotine has allowed me to take control of my life and be the best person I can be. No negative side effects besides some sleeplessness when starting the drug."
