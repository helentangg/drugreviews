"I started taking Prozac two years ago, and I thought it wasn&#039;t doing anything for me. So I cut cold turkey (which I do not advise because you could become very suicidal) and I did not take it for 6 months. Just about a week ago I started taking it again, and I have to say I feel so much better. I realized Prozac was working for me because I wasn&#039;t having intense feelings anymore when small things upset me. I was able to cope with them more. And now when I look back on when I was taking it years prior to my cut off. I remembered I did better than when I wasn&#039;t taking. I&#039;m really pleased on this medication and I&#039;m glad I take it. Yes I still get upset but I do not go from being a 1 to a 10. Remember its not a magic pill. It is only to help."
