"I am 35 years old and I have 6 kids, my doctor prescribed Pristiq to help with anxiety of day to day life. I have been on it for about 5 days now, for the first time in years I am finally sleeping through the night. But I am having some side effects, such as tiredness and increase in appetite. Hopefully this will subside with time."
