"I was diagnosed with GAD (general anxiety disorder) I was previously on cipralex and felt like a zombie taking it. I didn&#039;t want to take it anymore so my doctor prescribed me celexa about a month ago.

I have a bit of a hard time sleeping, tossing and turning but overall I do get my rest. 
I feel drowsy after the first few hours of taking it. Little bit irritable sometimes, short of patience. Over all I&#039;m not overthinking at night anymore, not stressing nearly as much and actually have motivation to do the things I want to."
