"I&#039;ve been on Cmybalta for about one month. 1st week on 30mg and 2nd week on 60mg. Only side effect for the first 2 weeks was lucid dreams and insomnia. I have really bad nerve problem in the upper and lower back which causes a lot of stress to my shoulder trapezius and chest muscle. Cymbalta helps me manage the upper back, shoulder, trapezius and chest pain well enough, but nothing for the lower back. I noticed the pain reduction in the 2nd week. It&#039;s not a miracle pill but it sure helps."
