"I had no major side effects on this med &amp; it&#039;s helped my anxiety &amp; depression. I&#039;ve been taking it for 6 months. I titrated up to 20mg. The Med was helping my mood but I had diarrhea that wasn&#039;t temporary so they put me on 10mg.  The 10mg is working just fine for me but I still get diarrhea every now &amp; then whereas I didn&#039;t before starting Viibryd  Something peculiar- it seems since starting Viibryd, my guts are intolerant to veggies I ate fine before I started the med. Lettuces (even organic from the grocery not sprayed w/preservatives, cooked cauliflower etc run right through me now. It&#039;s common for ppl to have this affect w/o this med but I never was sensitive. Not sure if there is a correlation. It&#039;s not crampy so for now staying on Viibryd."
