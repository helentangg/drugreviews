"Pristiq has been a miracle for me. I had depression, anxiety disorder and panic attack disorder. I had tried many other medications, gained 50lbs, and was still mentally a mess. I had to take over a year off of school because I couldnt handle the stress. I started Pristiq and within a week i noticed I was no longer crying at the drop of a hat, was better able to concentrate and was actually feeling so much better in my mood. Ive been taking it for over a year now, ive lost 40 of the 50lbs i gained on my previous medication, and im back at school and doing great. I credit Pristiq with all of my recovery. 
For the first 2 weeks of Prestiq i had a side effect of insomnia, but that went away after 2 weeks, it was no big deal."
