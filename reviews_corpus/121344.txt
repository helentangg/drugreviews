"In my 25 years of being put on various medications, this is--by far--the best.  I suffered from anxiety and PTSD, which (of course) would lead to depression.  I&#039;d contend with crying spells and outbursts of anger.  The first few days of taking 75 mg/day, I did have some side effects (such as racing thoughts, sleeplessness, etc.), but my body adjusted quickly.  I now wake up every day feeling more hopeful, and with ZERO crying spells.  I am still ME, and never feel like a zombie.  I am still aware of my surroundings and what annoys me, yes, but my RECOVERY from processing those things is much faster, and I bounce right back.  In other words, my perspective of things is normalized, and my days aren&#039;t ruined.  Wonderful stuff!"
