"I had epilepsy surgery last year and I have suffered with headaches ever since. After over a year of trying different remedies my doctor prescribed Elavil. I was so tired of having headaches everyday that I was willing to try anything. I take one 25mg tablet at bedtime and my headaches have gone away. It&#039;s like I never had them. Elavil has been a blessing to me."
