"I have been taking Brintellix for about 1 week now and I have never felt better, I have had not one side effect although I am not as hungry as normal other than that it is amazing. I am less agitated than usual and have a lot more patience I seem to think clearly and life is going back to the way it used to be. I am hoping that my libido will return as this disappeared during the depression.
Very thankful for these meds"
