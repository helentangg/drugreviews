"Okay, first I will say the good. This medicine got rid of my depression for the most part very quickly. I had been cutting myself and was close to trying suicide, they switched my medicine to this and I was MUCH better. However.... every single time I take I end up insanely nauseous within minutes and end up throwing up for about three-four hours. 
As much as the medicine helped, I am going to have to change it due to this because I can&#039;t spend hours throwing up every day while being a single mom trying to get things done."
