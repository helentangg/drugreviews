"I was on citalopram for about 2 years after I noticed that it stopped working. My psychiatrist prescribed me Sertraline 100mg per day. It went worse for me. I lost nearly every interest and my concentration in school was just awful. After 5 Weeks without improvement I stopped the medication. I slowly reached my normal mindset. I know that the drugs are no wonder pills, but I really hoped for an improvement like on citalopram. I will try out bupropion next week. Hope it will help more."
