"I was experiencing panic attacks, which persisted for 5 days. I have had this disorder my whole life, but it was bad, and I developed depression along with it this time. I was prescribed Zoloft, and after a few days, I feel amazing! The panic has reduced by about 70%, and I feel happier than I have for a while. Instead of wanting to crawl in a hole and shy away from my responsibilities, I feel like I now want to do things, and no longer feel the need to take Xanax. I feel amazing, and more importantly, I feel like me again. The only side effect I noticed was lack of appetite, and I have to make myself eat. Other than that, no side effects, and hopefully my appetite will return when my body adjusts to the medication. Thank you Zoloft!"
