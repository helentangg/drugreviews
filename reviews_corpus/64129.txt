"Started taking 50mg about 16 weeks ago, although it&#039;s doing what it&#039;s supposed to I&#039;m still nauseous at least twice a week, I take it in the morning which isn&#039;t great as by 2pm I feel very fatigued, also I&#039;ve been told by close friends I&#039;m not the same person. I&#039;m more relaxed, nothing phases me anymore which isn&#039;t great, I&#039;ve lost my edge, my identity but it has sorted my anxiety and depression and I no longer have suicidal thoughts so I guess it&#039;s a good thing."
