"I think my depression is more situational. I&#039;m unhappy with my job, where I live and being alone.  I started taking the 50mg, I felt better the first week, then 3 weeks later started taking the 100mg, I don&#039;t notice a change. True about taking the drug when you wake up, it gives you energy. Take it when you wake up or you will not sleep well. I&#039;ve had a couple of really strange dreams. The problem is that I need to make some changes in my life to really find happiness and really knock out this depression. The only side effect I have is reduced sex drive."
