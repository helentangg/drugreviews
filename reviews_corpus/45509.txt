"Prozac took my worries away. That is all I wanted. I wasn&#039;t depressed. I used to wake up at night having bad dreams and worries that went over and over in my head. I couldn&#039;t sleep. After beginning Prozac that all stopped. It did unfortunately give me an &quot;I don&#039;t care&quot; attitude about what other people thought of me. My sister complained about that with me and said i was difficult to talk to. So I stopped taking it (gradually). Now I wake up every night again with terrible anxiety thoughts and dreams (mostly about things that are happening in my life).  I haven&#039;t heard anyone talking about this. Any comments?"
