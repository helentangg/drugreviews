"I have been on Lexapro for about 10 months. I absolutely love it. For about the first month, I was on 10 mg and talked with my doctor about needing more so we bumped it up to 20 mg. After 6 months on being on 20 mg, I felt too relaxed and drowsy, so we have cut back to 10 mg.  I feel great. For awhile, I was really sleepy, but have gotten back in a positive sleep rhythm. Looking to cut back to 5 mg soon. It takes a few weeks to kick in, but the wait is worth it."
