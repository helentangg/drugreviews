"I rated a 5 because sometimes it helped and sometimes it did not. When I first began to take Lexapro, I was very tired, and I was like a zombie. There was a small range of emotion for me. It did help with my depression and my anxiety, but I was still depressed. At one point in time when I was taking medication, I had a depressive episode where I began to have hallucinations. I don&#039;t think Lexapro was the cause, but I don&#039;t think it helped very much either. All in all it was more or less helpful with my Major Depressive Disorder and anxiety."
