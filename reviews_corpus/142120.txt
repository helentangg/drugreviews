"I&#039;ve been taking Lexapro for roughly 5 months.  The benefit to risk ratio is positive compared to other anti-depressants.  It is not a miracle encapsulated inside a pill.  I hope it is helping.  Motivation and sleeplessness remain my major adversaries.  Of course, your mileage may vary.  It is a helpful (and expensive) medication."
