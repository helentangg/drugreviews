"I started on Sertraline at 50mg where it made me feel VERY bad for the first few days, I fainted, felt sick and could not do a thing I felt so depressed. Gradually the side effects wore off apart from dry mouth and needing to pee at night but then the doctor increased it to 100mg because I felt the exact same as before I took the tablets and now I still get stomach pain everyday and feel awful, the side effects just aren&#039;t going away and I want off them now."
