"Prozac is a wonderful medicine. I started on it 1 year ago and took it for about 4 months and stopped because I was feeling great. Depression returned and I am on it again. I felt difference in a few hours after taking the first pill! Prozac made me feel like a happy person again. All my worries and obsessive thoughts faded away. They are there in the back of my head but they are only as thoughts nothing to worry about every minute of my life. It works great for me!"
