"After 3 months of severe anxiety and depression, which got worse before my periods, I wound up having a panic attack and went to the ER. I thought my life was ending, my world was up-side-down. I had no drive to do anything and worried all of the time. My doctor figured out that I had PMDD and prescribed me Celexa along with YAZ. I haven&#039;t felt this good ever. The first month on Celexa I was very tired, but other then that I have felt great."
