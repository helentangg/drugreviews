"I was diagnosed with Breast Cancer at age 41. Fortunately for me, it was Stage 0 DCIS. Unfortunately for me, the hot flashes started a few years later and almost ruined my life. I was getting about 30 a day, including having to get out of bed to walk around outside to cool down every hour. I was on no sleep, couldn&#039;t work, couldn&#039;t function.  I couldn&#039;t take anything because of the BC but I knew I couldn&#039;t continue like that so I did my own research, spoke to 3 different oncologists and told my doctor about the drug. He had never heard of it but gave me a few samples. The hot flashes literally disappeared immediately. I took them for a year with zero side effects except 15 lbs weight gain but I wasn&#039;t dieting or exercising. Saved my life!"
