"I lost my 16 year old daughter in a tragic car accident four months ago. They first had me on lexapro, then remeron, and neither did anything for me, except the remeron did make me suicidial. 
My Doc told me to try Cymbalta 30 mg. It was a life saver, literally. I was ready to kill myself, I had enough pain and didn&#039;t want to feel that daily pain of losing my daughter. My Doc just increased my Cymbalta to 60 mg, I&#039;m very excited about this. 
I have not noticed it helping the panic or the anxiety, it def has helped my mind and my body constantly from hurting due to depression. This medicine truly saved my life. I&#039;ll never be me again, but this medicine has got me back to the closest old me. Thankful for Cymbalta!"
