"After citalopram stopped working after 10 years my dr changed me to sertraline. Started on 50mg for 3 days then went to 100mg. I was a total mess, couldn&#039;t eat, lost 1 stone in 3 weeks, was sick after drinking water, had tremors, night sweats, became depressed, had suicidal thoughts (am 41 and never had them before) became agrophobic - the list is endless. Unfortunately it took 2 months to see a psychiatrist who told me they weren&#039;t agreeing with me so am weaning off them and feeling loads better. Was put on mirtazapine and they seem to be working. This medicine seems to help lots of people but please trust your instincts and have a good relationship with your doctor to discuss side effects etc."
