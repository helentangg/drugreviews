"I have had anxiety, panic attacks &amp; obsessive thoughts for years on and off. About 5 months ago I started to get horrible non-stop intrusive thoughts I knew the thoughts/fears/worries were nonsense but I couldn&#039;t turn them off. I was in a panic attack from the moment I woke up to the moment I fell asleep. I would wake up several times at night in full blown panic....it was horrible. I never ever wanted to take medicine I was so afraid of it not working or it making me worse. Zoloft has helped me so much at first I had a good day then a bad day  and I wasn&#039;t sure if that was normal. after 2 months the doctor upped my dose then a month later I felt better then 100% still a little anxious during my period  but very mild and manageable."
