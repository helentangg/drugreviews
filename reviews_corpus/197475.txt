"I am on my 3rd week of taking Paxil.  The first week was difficult as my side effects were nervousness (which makes you think you are having an anxiety attack) and sleepiness.  After about 4 or 5 days I started feeling better and better.  I have only had 1 very small attack since being on it.  I feel SO much better and happier.  I finally feel like myself again. Good luck to all of you!"
