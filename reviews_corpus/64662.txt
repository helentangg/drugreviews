"Suffered quite bad anxiety for a number of years but tried every herbal remedy, acupuncture etc as I didn&#039;t want to go on meds. After the initial common side effects that lasted a few weeks I began to notice subtle changes. After a few months I feel great and wish I&#039;d done it sooner. I spent a long time being like a bag of nerves doing the most everyday task ie grocery shop, work etc I&#039;d have palpitations, shakes, fight or flight feeling along with constant I.b.s. I get a very odd &quot;off&quot; day which isn&#039;t nowhere as near as bad as before the mess, overall I feel the best I have done in years. I can now do normal things without thinking I&#039;m going to have a panic attack, socialising more, don&#039;t get ill so frequently and generally more energy."
