"I&#039;ve decided to try taking it at night, as my first 2 days of going up to 20mg have been awful. Blurry vision is awful as I&#039;m a nurse with a 35-50 minute commute, then the flushing, vivid dreams, and overall malaise. I described it as feeling worse than the worst hangover you&#039;ve ever had to my husband. I&#039;ll update after I switch to bedtime dose, I trust my doctor and pharmacist and they are hopeful."
