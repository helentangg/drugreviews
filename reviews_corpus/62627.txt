"I was hesitant to turn to drugs to treat my depression. I read through this page and saw that it really seemed to help some people so I gave it a try. Totally changed my life for the better. The first few weeks were rough, getting used to the medicines but I stuck with it and couldn&#039;t be happier. Life is pleasurable again. My energy level is up, sex is enjoyable again, I started to exercise and have lost 15 lbs. To anyone thinking of trying it, it IS worth a shot. Don&#039;t feel bad about asking a doctor for help. It is nothing to be ashamed about and could make a HUGE difference for the better in your life."
