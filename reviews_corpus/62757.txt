"I responded after one week. The side effects (lethargy, some bowel problems) are the only reason i didnt rate this medicine a 10. After 44 years of excessive anxiety and depression I finally feel like I can be &quot;myself&quot; instead enslaved to unreasonable thoughts and frustrations. Ironically, I avoided these types of meds for years, instead &quot;self medicating&quot; with alcohol and cynicism. Had I switched to this years ago maybe I would still be married to a wonderful woman. Sad, but true."
