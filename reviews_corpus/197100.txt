"Withdrawal is a literal nightmare!  Headaches, shock/buzz in ears/head, lump in throat, chills, nightsweats, crying. It&#039;s been 5 weeks and MD said gastric distress and nausea may still be from withdrawal. Libido and joy of life are returning but give yourself a month without major social events to get back on your feet."
