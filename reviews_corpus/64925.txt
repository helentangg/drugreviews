"I was hesitant to post a review since I haven&#039;t even been taking sertaline a week yet. However, I&#039;ll share for anyone looking for an initial experience.

Although it&#039;s common for this medication to to kick in for at least two weeks, I do believe I have felt a slight difference thus far. I&#039;ve been going through emotional relationship issues for about a month now. Before starting this medication, I had CONSTANT recurring negative thoughts, I would feel down almost all day, I wouldn&#039;t have any motivation and my work ethic had plummeted.

5 days on the medication and it has stopped the recurring thoughts. While I still experience the pain of the situation, I&#039;m still able to feel like myself without the anxiety having such a strong effect on me."
