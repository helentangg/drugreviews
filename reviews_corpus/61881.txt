"After having mild but persistent depression for 18 years it got much worse after having my first baby. I&#039;d never took any depression medication, but my GP recommended to take Cipramil. It took around 4 - 6 weeks before I really felt the benefit of the medicine with mild side effects such as nausea, dizziness and not being able to concentrate. But now I&#039;ve been taking it for 9 months and I&#039;m so happy and coping with life much better, and most importantly having fun and enjoying my baby. I put on 5 kg since started to take Cipramil, but I think I eat more now that I can enjoy my food.I&#039;m not sure another long term side effects, but I&#039;m so thankful that I can feel joy in life again after being miserable for so long."
