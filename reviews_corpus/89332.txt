"I have had absolutely no side effects while on this medication. My anxiety is obviously not &quot;cured&quot; but the symptoms are much more manageable and they occur less frequently . My life has SIGNIFICANTLY improved since beginning Celexa. Not only do I feel less anxious most of the time, but my social skills have improved. I&#039;m not afraid to talk to people as much anymore. I know some people believe that antidepressants change who you are, but that is not true. If they do, that is not the drug for you. The right antidepressant is suppose to allow you to be who you are without (as much) anxiety. **IMPORTANT: You do have to be on the look out for drug interactions. There are many antibiotics you shouldn&#039;t take while taking Celexa including Cipro.**"
