"I have been on Zoloft for 7 months now and it has really improved my life. The first few weeks were absolutely BRUTAL. Couldn&#039;t focus, super dizzy, nausea, more depressed, etc. However, I stuck with it and after about a month, the depression started to get much better. Of course, I still have my days (who doesn&#039;t?) but I would highly recommend trying Zoloft if you can get through the first few weeks. It truly has changed my life for the better."
