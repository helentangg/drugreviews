"I have taken this medication for six years and it has really helped with my migraines and my inability to sleep or stay asleep. I started off at 10mg and slowly increased to 50mg and have been on the same dosage for the past four. The only downside is my absolute need to take it at the same time every night in order for it to make me sleepy otherwise I can stay up the entire night if I take it later than 9pm."
