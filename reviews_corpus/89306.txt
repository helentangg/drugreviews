"I&#039;m only one week in, and seriously feel better.  I&#039;m a mom of two and a lawyer--I&#039;ve suffered a lot of loss and have been shouldering a lot of stresses.  I&#039;ve always been anxious, but just thought that was who I was. My doctor put me on 10 mg of Celexa.  I did have some nausea the first few days and headaches, but other than that nothing.  I had so much anxiety about taking the medication, I almost didn&#039;t.  But one evening my daughter told me that all of the things I worry about turn out fine--and she was right.  If you need help, sometimes you can&#039;t do it yourself.  I exercise, meditate, eat well, sleep well, but I couldn&#039;t shake the anxiety.  This has helped a ton. I laugh, I feel more relaxed, and I&#039;m gratefully enjoying life again."
