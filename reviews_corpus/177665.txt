"My personal journey with Cymbalta so far is a positive one. Severe anxiety/depression has been present in my life for approximately four years and I&#039;ve found that Cymbalta has immensely suppressed my anxious symptoms. Through my experience, Cymbalta took on its full effect about 3 weeks in. I am beginning to enjoy life again! I highly recommend this medication to others, especially if immense anxiety is a part of your life. I am most impressed with this medications ability to deplete anxiety! Good Luck! I hope the best for anyone struggling with these miserable conditions."
