"I just started about two weeks ago. I completely see a difference in myself for the better. My children are even noticing the difference in my reactions to basic things. I won&#039;t say I don&#039;t feel anything..but this is a period in my life...feeling nothing is what I need. I am able react  to situations with logic. Instead of being on the emotional roller coaster all the time! I was suicidal two weeks ago. I took my kids zip-lining yesterday. I needed this. I&#039;ll deal with the withdraws later..this medication saved my life. I work out 4days a week so no energy loss. I don&#039;t feel a change in my appetite yet. I did have headaches yesterday briefly. dreams.. falling dream a few times. No weight gain so far. Sex. I don&#039;t have a desire yet."
