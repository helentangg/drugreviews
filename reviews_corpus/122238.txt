"I started the Effexor XR 7 years ago after dealing with 2 years of postpartum depression. I finally stopped being stubborn and went to the doctor. It started working right away, but believe me don&#039;t miss a dose or be late with one when you first start taking them, you body will not like you.  I was off of them for many years and was doing well. Recently due to stress I have gone back to my old moody self and having blow ups and am back on them and again working right away. You feel much calmer and once you get through the time of your body getting used to them you are clear headed and happy. Don&#039;t let the first few days discourage you."
