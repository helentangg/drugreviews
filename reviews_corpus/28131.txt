"lexapro helped me tremendously, it basically saved my life. I was horrified before I started, because of course I went online to see reviews and the side effects but all I got was bad experiences but mine has been amazing. I feel so much better, so much more free, like I&#039;m actually living again. I lost a little weight from it (which is a plus) and I feel great! I hope this helps for some people!"
