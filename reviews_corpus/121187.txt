"I have been on venlafaxing for over a year now and I have lost weight I feel awesome  but I did take 2 years of extensive counseling like private sessions and group counseling. I was active in all the events also like bowling, ceramics, exercise classes, picnics and even trips to places like the zoo. All this was in a group sometimes coed and sometimes just the women&#039;s group. All this was funded through the state of Az. I even went through Hep-C treatment for the 4th time. I attribute all this to getting through treatment with a more positive frame of mind and the Hep-C is gone!"
