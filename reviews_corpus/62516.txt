"This medication did help with anxiety and stress but at times I was too calm. I let the kids get away with everything and I was on the lowest dose. It made me feel disconnected from my family and withdrawal from them. I also had strange thoughts about life, not happy, didn&#039;t want to be a wife and mother anymore. had to quit taking it and now I feel more normal. Managing the stress is tough, but I am getting through it."
