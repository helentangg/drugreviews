"I&#039;ve been on 40mg for almost 8 weeks now.  Was working great in the beginning, especially weeks 3-5, but for some reason the beneficial mood effects wore off and I don&#039;t feel any different now than before.  The only thing I can think of is around that same time I started seeing a shrink and he put me on Xanax XR 0.5mg 1-2 times per day.  Could the Xanax XR have killed off the positive effects I was having with the Viibryd?  Not sure yet. By the way, I had literally NO negative side effects from taking this medication.  I always take it in the morning, never at night.  Tried that once and it kept me up all night."
