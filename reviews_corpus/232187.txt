"I&#039;ve anxiety had a minimal level 4 about 6 months now and it has been getting worse and worse now my doctor tells me to up my cymbalta 290 milligrams, it&#039;s been about the month that I have done that along with taking my anxiety medicine both together really isn&#039;t doing much good.
Will it help me?"
