"I am a new person since I am taking this medicine. I had social phobia, major depression, obsessive suicidal thoughts. I&#039;m taking 50mg and now I feel happy, motivated, no more anger attacks, even my intellectual capacities and memory have improved a lot, and most important, I feel like I don&#039;t care anymore what other persons think of me!
Side effects: I yawned a lot the first 3-4 days. The other side effect is that my sexual desire is not as high as before and its difficult to reach orgasm. "
