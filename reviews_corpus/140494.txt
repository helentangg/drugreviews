"I have been on escitalopram for 3 months or so. I take it for mild panic attacks and it seems to have knocked them out for the most part. A side benefit is that my OCD Hs pretty much been eliminated. I didn&#039;t really realize that I had OCD but I guess I have always had it. Nothing severe, I couldn&#039;t have remotes, cell phones or similar items pointing at me and at work I used to make sure I did everything in a certain order while having all my tools lined up in specific ways. I think now I do it out of habit but I&#039;m not scrambling to put something in order if I notice that it isn&#039;t.  I&#039;m not sure what my dosage is but I haven&#039;t experienced any negative side effects that I can think of. Hope you all have the same benefits that I do."
