"Don&#039;t take it. Your emotions become dull and feel fake. Even your laughter feels fake. Your sleep becomes horrible. You overeat because you don&#039;t care anymore. The first week you feel like you&#039;re on meth. It feels great. Then it wears away and you become a dull and empty mess with memory problems and no motivation to do anything including getting off of the medicine. It&#039;s easier just to take it. I&#039;m in my second week of withdrawal. I would just take 8-10 beads when I would get dizzy and it would go away. ez-pz. My depression did come back even worse. Maybe it&#039;s my minds way of telling me I&#039;m not doing anything to make my life better. Maybe I should change my life instead of taking a pill, especially this pill."
