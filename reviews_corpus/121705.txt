"I switched to Effexor after taking Prozac for years and it just didn&#039;t seem to be working for me anymore.  I&#039;m so glad My Doctor suggested I switch to Effexor.  I&#039;ve been taking for about 2 years and it seems to be working great for me.  I very rarely have a down day.  You must take as directed and not miss dosages.  I can&#039;t miss more than 1 days dosage or I will get nauseous and dizzy."
