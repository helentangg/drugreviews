"This med really helped me through a difficult time.  I had ongoing GI illnesses/food allergies that just wiped me out.  It took that to turn to a pharmaceutical aid.  It really did work.  It made me drowsy so I had to adjust from taking it in the morning until bedtime.  After my other physical trials passed (my GI system working properly), I did find that I gained a lot of weight and was a bit flat emotionally.  Even my hubs commented on seeming a bit too indifferent.  I chose to carefully wean off the medicined.  Weaning off the medicine takes a good deal of effort - be prepared for that.  Yet, I was thankful I had this medicine while I really needed it."
