"I have been on cipralex for 4 weeks now and my doc increased it to 40mg however when I was on 30mg I didn&#039;t have as mugh anxiety. I feel the drug has helped more with my depression but my anxiety is still severe. I take lorazepam also twice a day and seroquel at nite to sleep. I&#039;m just hoping it gets better with my anxiety. I also take seroquel 25mg as a prn. I&#039;ve been told to be patient but it&#039;s so hard when you don&#039;t feel good."
