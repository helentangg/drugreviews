"I am in control of my thoughts and emotions and that&#039;s all I can ask for ! I don&#039;t easily cry or become depressed anymore.. I don&#039;t say hateful and mean things when I&#039;m angry... I feel mentally stable and am in a much happier place just 3 weeks in. Didn&#039;t have any side affects only think was that people asked why I&#039;ve been so much happier. I recommend Prozac and never take any other kind of pills."
