"I&#039;m a 35-year-old woman and was on Lexapro 10mg from ages 21-30 and have been on 5mg for about 5 weeks now (staying at this dose) - both times for GAD without Depression and a touch of OCD.  For the most part, I managed fairly well while off it (exercise, limited alcohol, CBT therapy) but had periods where my anxiety would flare up. My advice would be to try it. I was very anxious about idea of going back on medication (i.e. Googling all the horrible side effects) but I&#039;m feeling significantly calmer, less anxious, and happier.  I didn&#039;t think I needed medication...until I went back on medication (give it a few weeks) and felt the difference.  I had convinced myself I was &quot;OK&quot; but really, I was &quot;white knuckling&quot; through my anxiety."
