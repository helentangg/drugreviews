"Very positive experience w Zoloft. Literally has saved my life. I started on 50mg, not very helpful. Maintained dose at 100mg for several years, but finally got courage to take 150mg, and it&#039;s been so helpful. I still get acute stress rxns once in a while (less than 1x/month) but my symptoms overall are vastly improved."
