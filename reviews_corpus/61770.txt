"I was put on 10mg to begin with, and I did suffer mild side effects. I had nausea and drowsiness for the first two days and these stopped when I starting taking the pill at night. However when I took it at night I had insomnia, tight chest and felt my heart pounding a lot. I was worried at first but this passed after another couple days. By day 5 I felt like my old self, no side effects and when in stressful situation, no symptoms of anxiety which was great. I went up to 20mg on day 9 and still felt great, with no side effects when upping the dose. Hope this helps those of you about to start Citalopram. Just stick with it, ride the first wave and you will be fine :) x"
