"Had panic attacks and social anxiety starting in adolescence. Powered through until postpartum depression after my second child and began having severe mood swings, irritability and panic attacks (dizzy spells, heart racing, fainting, chest pain) even when I wasn&#039;t feeling stress. Started Effexor on 37.5mg and had almost immediate success (within a week). Felt a little hyper and would feel like I was getting a low jolt of electricity through my legs, but otherwise fine. Gained a bit of weight but I think that&#039;s only because I was finally able to eat without stomach pain. Increased to 70mg after two months when panic attacks began again, love this drug! Finally have a normal life."
