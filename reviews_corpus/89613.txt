"I&#039;ve had anxiety my entire life (as long as I can remember). I&#039;ve had counseling over and over again with no results. I&#039;m 31 now. I took Zoloft and Klonopin at about 19 years old with HORRIBLE side effects. I&#039;ve been anti-medication since 19, but three days ago, I told my doctor I was FED UP with the lack of sleep, full-blown panic attacks, and feeling like I&#039;m dying every hour to a point that my marriage is being adversely affected and my son is suffering from having less than the mom he deserves. He put me on 20 mg of Celexa. I don&#039;t know what to expect in a few weeks, but I already search for the anxious thoughts and can&#039;t find them. I&#039;m SO hopeful that side effects will subside and that I&#039;ll still be me but better!"
