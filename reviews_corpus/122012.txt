"Effexor XR treated my depression very well. It relieved me of the despair that kept me from leading a productive life. On the other hand, I felt an inability to feel strong emotion of any kind. I didn&#039;t get excited by anything, I didn&#039;t laugh in funny movies or cry in sad movies. I felt generally good, but also felt that I was missing out on something. I quit Effexor cold turkey - NOT a good idea - and experienced terrible withdrawal symptoms. Don&#039;t expect to come off this medicine easily, though it is possible. As a side note, I experienced intensely vivid dreams while taking Effexor, dreams that made absolutely no sense. I gave up telling anyone about them because they thought I was lying."
