"I&#039;m a 47 years old man that had NEVER ever in my life had taken an anti depressent.  I have always had anxiety and would take xanax as needed .25mg. First few weeks of February I had a lot of negative things happen in my life and my anxiety went through the roof and I was borderline depressed. My Dr Perscribed me Lexapro 10mg. THAT WAS THE WORST 8 DAYS OF MY LIFE. I got upset stomach. And in the first 3 days I started talking to myself and had suicidal thoughts and aggression.  I was absolutely scared out of my mind. My anxiety worsened to the point where I couldn&#039;t sleep for 3 days. I was literally dying inside. So my Dr stopped it. Then withdrawal set in. 5 days later I&#039;m coming out of it. I&#039;m on seroquel now. MUCH BETTER. Actually helps the anxiety."
