"I&#039;m super medication sensitive so I started out at 5mg for panic disorder. My doctor said there&#039;s no way 5mg is going to help, but after 4 weeks it was like a switch was flicked. I went back to my old self for 3 whole days. I had to come off of it due to uncontrollable neck jerking and head twitching. It&#039;s the strangest thing I&#039;ve ever experienced. It&#039;s been over a month since I quit and I&#039;m still doing it alot. Not as much, but seriously way too much. I hope this isn&#039;t permanent. Now I have panic disorder and neck jerking. Lovely."
