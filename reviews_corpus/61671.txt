"I was originally prescribed Citalopram 7 years ago, diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, and it had very little effect. It was later discovered I had Bipolar Disorder; I was prescribed Citalopram a few times and it never did much.

A month ago I was again put on 20mg Citalopram, but this time for panic disorder.

We noticed a change almost instantly; I haven&#039;t had a day of panic since I started this medication, and my overall anxiety is much lower too. I had a few side effects (some nausea, loss of appetite, sleep disruption) which I&#039;d never experienced with this drug before, but most of these faded in week two. We have noticed my dissociation is much worse than usual - normally happens 2-4 times a week, is now happening daily."
