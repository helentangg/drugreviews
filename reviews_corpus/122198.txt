"I started taking this medication about 3 years ago for Depression/Social Anxiety. I will say for depression this drug worked wonders, not so much anxiety though. However, recently I&#039;ve decided to try for the 3rd time to stop taking it. The withdrawal you get from Effexor is the worst feeling."
