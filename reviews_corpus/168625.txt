"Unlike any other anti-depressant I have tried, if I missed a single dose withdrawal symptoms would immediately begin.  Scary dreams accompanied by brain zaps are just a few that need to be shared!! They seemed so real!! It was a side-effect that I could not handle and everyone should be warned about the night terrors before starting this medication.  I can only imagine the horror of missing two doses. That alone was enough for me to switch back to Celexa. It did help with my mood but this medicine seemed too potent or too dangerous for some reason. The &quot;what ifs&quot; where always in the back of my mind."
