"Worst experience I&#039;ve ever had on any medication.  My doctor started me on a small dose.  Within 30 minutes of taking it, I felt a buzzing in my head and a fuzzy, numb feeling.  Then, about an hour later, the really bad side effects kicked in.  My heart started racing and feeling like it was going to explode.  I started hearing voices.  I felt so bad I almost called 911 -- I couldn&#039;t even stand up or lay down -- just laid propped up on the couch for about 24 hours until the effects started wearing off.  It was the scariest experience I&#039;ve ever had and made me afraid to take any other anti-depressant."
