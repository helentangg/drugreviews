"I have been taking sertraline for 9 months now, after the loss of my younger brother and mother which led to severe depression. I have found it to be very good and I have my life back. The only down side is not being able to have an orgasm. Even taking Viagra has not helped this. But on the bright side I am now full of life again and am moving forward."
