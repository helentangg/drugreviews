"I&#039;m only on day 4 and already feeling a difference. I&#039;m a 33 year old male and have been depressed for about 5 years and also suffer from anxiety in the form of being a chronic worry wort. I would find things to worry about. It&#039;s almost ended my marriage. I was brought up in a world where therapy and medication was taboo.  At the urging of my wife, I saw my physician this week and she put me on 20 mg and therapy. I&#039;m only 4 days in, but already noticed a calming effect.  The only side effects I&#039;ve noticed thus far is drowsiness, but it seems if I take a quick 5-10 min nap after feeling drowsy, I&#039;m good. My physician says it will go away after a few weeks. Haven&#039;t had sex yet so I can&#039;t comment on sexual side effects."
