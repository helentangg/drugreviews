"I suffer from depression and anxiety.  For the last 20 years, I&#039;ve had counseling and been on many antidepressants; Prozac, wellbutrin, Paxil, etc.  Effexor is the first medication that has noticeably helped.   I was worried after reading all the negative reviews, but tried it anyway.   I noticed a change after the first week, and it has gotten better ever since.  Been on it for two years now and all is good in the world.  Very rarely get sad, unless there is a reason for it (death, break up, pet dying) also I used to have anxiety talking to more than one person at a time, now I can talk to a room full of people with little to no anxiety."
