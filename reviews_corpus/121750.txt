"My medication was changed to 75mg of Venlafaxine, combined with Lyrica and Arthrotec. I have been almost completely pain free for 1st time in 3 years. Was thinking of asking doc to reduce/remove Venlafaxine and Arthrotec, as I thought I was taking too many things and the Lyrica alone was enough. Then I ran out of Venlafaxine for 36 hours and wondered why I was in pain and couldn&#039;t sleep. Hence this long entry at 04.33am - Venlafaxine. "
