"During the month I took Cymbalta, it helped relieve my fatigue and may or may not have helped with some of my pain.  When I first started taking it, I felt completely drunk all the time, but these side effects got better after two weeks.  I was unable to sleep for more than three hours at a time and had a very hard time falling back to sleep, and this is why my doctor took me off of this medicine.  Although it helped with my fatigue, not getting enough sleep meant I was very tired.  I also experienced severe constipation (bleeding with every bowel movement, which was about once or twice every two weeks), my sex drive completely disappeared, and I constantly felt dizzy. "
