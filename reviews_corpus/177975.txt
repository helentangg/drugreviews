"I was in a major depression: I had considerable lethargy, anxiety, weight loss, racing thoughts that I could not seem to turn off and I felt suicidal. I couldn&#039;t make the smallest of decisions. I was terrified to drive and I&#039;ve been driving for over 30 years! I also had great difficulty performing even the simplest of tasks- some things I could not do at all!  After about a month I noticed tremendous relief. It was like a huge cloud had been lifted and that  I had been pulled out of a &#039;huge hole&#039;!  I definitely feel Cymbalta saved MY life."
