"Been on Prozac for 3 weeks now and starting to see light at end of tunnel. Stomach pain an nausea the first couple weeks but much better now. I&#039;m sleeping well and feel more relaxed. I find I actually want to do things like take a walk, play with grandkids, clean house and take care of myself. I didn&#039;t want to do anything before Prozac. I just existed. Thanks to Prozac I&#039;m now living at 56 years old!"
