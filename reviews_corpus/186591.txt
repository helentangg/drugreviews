"At 27, I have suffered from manic depression for over 10 years now and always thought I could manage the depression naturally. Was given Pristiq last week after seeing my family doctor in tears over feeling resentful towards my partner since the birth of our daughter and also stressed and unable to cope. After a bit of convincing from my Dr, I decided that my family staying together was too important not to try it and I have to say WOW! I feel like a new person and wonder with horror just how long I could have gone on talking myself out of what in the end has completely changed my life for the better! I adore my life suddenly, have no feelings of anxiety or fear or resentfulness. Hope it lasts."
