"Viibryd worked wonders for me.  I have to admit the first week was hell as it made me extremely anxious but after the transition I couldn&#039;t believe the difference it made.  The only problem I ran into was insurance companies don&#039;t want to pay for  it because it is expensive. I ended up having to switch to another drug that was not nearly as effective.  I&#039;m thinking about going back on Viibryd and paying for it out of pocket.  I just have to ask myself what is happiness worth??"
