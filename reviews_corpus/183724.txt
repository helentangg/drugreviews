"I was prescribed Cymbalta over a year ago, after a crippling anxiety attack and I will have to say, it&#039;s helped me quite a bit. I was skeptical on taking it, because I had no positive outcomes with Wellbutrin or Zoloft, but this drug helped me with amazing results. The only thing I&#039;ve found (probably like with any other drug of this type) is that you NEED to take it on a scheduled basis. I have forgotten to take it or not been able to take it until 6 to 8 hours past my regular time and have to spend a few days readjusting to it. The only reason I gave Cymbalta a 9 instead of ten is for that reason and that weaning off this medicine may prove to be difficult."
