"I am a 48 yr old woman diagnosed with depression &amp; chronic fatigue. Took Pristiq for 4 months. My entire system was taxed! I became very angry, argumentative over-reacting to mostly everything, communicating ineffectively, raging, I never relaxed - insomnia! Major increase in pain, muscle spasm, migraines!,involuntary muscle movement, etc.! Getting off of it was a nightmare! More than a week of constant 24 hr. sickening withdrawal- vomiting, dizziness, confusion, severe pain muscle spasm migraines depression thoughts that I would never make it through! The only thing that helped was Prozac-20mg Vicodin-5-300 &amp; Tramadol-50mg as needed to Break Pain Cycle!"
