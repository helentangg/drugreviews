"I started this medication a few weeks ago and it&#039;s already working.  I don&#039;t wake up as much in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom and I sleep a lot better.  I haven&#039;t felt this good in awhile.  I can even eat/drink things I normally wouldn&#039;t be able to (in moderation of course)."
