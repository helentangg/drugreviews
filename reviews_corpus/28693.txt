"After trying numerous SSRI&#039;s and mood stabilizers and ready to give up, I tried Lexapro. It was new and just on the market. I love it. It has completely turned me around. I&#039;m normal again. Its good for anxiety too. No bad side effects. No weight gain. Its wonderful to have finally found a medicine that actually works. I hope it never stops working."
