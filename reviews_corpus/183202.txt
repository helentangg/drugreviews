"I have been taking Cymbalta for 15 months now. First 30mg and then six months later up it to 60mgs/day. It was prescribed to me for clinical depression.  It works for the depression and I also noticed it has worked very well for anxiety also.  My MD and I have discussed that I probably have had this anxiety disorder for some time and curtailed with the depression, Cymbalta has done well for both.  Side effects are weight gain (5-10 lbs), and bad withdrawal effects if you miss a day or two - headaches.  Otherwise, the medication has worked very well and I feel like I can live my life again."
