"Been on Lexapro for 4 years now. Have taken an SSRI for 15 years to battle Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Have taken Paxil &amp; Zoloft in the past, but Lexapro trumps them, hands down. With Paxil &amp; Zoloft I woke with anxiety. None with Lexapro. It&#039;s great and has improved my quality of life tremendously."
