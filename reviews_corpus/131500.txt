"I have been taking 75mg once per day, for 15 yrs.  Has always worked well for me with no side effects but I would like to get off of it because........15 yrs! Do I still need it?  But if I miss one dose, brain shocks like crazy.  This is scary to me that it can do that.  It makes me very nervous about even considering weaning off of it."
