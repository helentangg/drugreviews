"Tonight was only my 4th night on the pill. My doctor has me on 10 mg at night for the first week. So far, the side effects are very uncomfortable. I mostly feel them right after taking my dose. My mouth is so dry, I&#039;m nauseous, gassy, I can&#039;t sleep and I&#039;m exhausted. I know the doctor said it could take weeks to work, so I&#039;m not knocking it yet. Also, some reviews I have read say that some of the side effects disappear and I am certainly counting on that. So far, I haven&#039;t seen much change in my anxiety and hopefully it comes soon."
