"I am a 60 year male who became disabled 14 years ago.  Every since I was unable to work or even walk I have been very depressed and had severe anxiety.  Once I was started on 20 mgs of Lexapro I felt like a new person.  It took a week or so for the full effect to come on but  have had no problems with side effects at all.  Thank God for Lexapro!"
