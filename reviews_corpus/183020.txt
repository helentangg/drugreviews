"This drug may have helped in the beginning but trying to get off this stuff is a nightmare. I have been on it for pain for 7 years and it is time to get off. My pain is better managed and so I have tried to wean off. Now I am going to try lowering the dose by emptying half out and taking for a month and then removing 3/4 and see what happens. The muscle cramping is horrendous so no way can I just stop it or stop cold turkey. Tried and not able to do it the cramps are debilitating. I have found that the days I do not take it, my constant itching is gone.....Should be some magic solution. This drug needs to be banned!"
