"My first time using citalopram I was on 10mg a day. My first couple days was difficult. Nausea, dizziness, terrible migraines. I had to excuse myself from work for a couple days til I adjusted. My moods did improve, and I took the meds for 6 months. I stopped taking them because I hated relying on meds for my emotional control, and the sexual dysfunction that accompanied it made me more anxious and it put rifts in my relationship. I was off meds for about 7 months, and since that time I&#039;ve gone through some traumatic experiences that have made it hard to stay in control. So I&#039;m now 4 days into my second try on the meds. I&#039;ve started at 20mg this time around. 2 days of side effects. We will see how this one goes."
