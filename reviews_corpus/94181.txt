"Hi, I&#039;m taking this drug for 7 days now. Just started with the drops. 1 mg more each day. I&#039;m now on 7 mg. Since 2 days it&#039;s keeping me awake all night... I don&#039;t have problems with my drive anymore (my mainproblem, besides bad concentration) but in case the sleep is not getting better I&#039;ll have problems with that for sure. Does anyone know if the sleep is still getting better after worsened through medication? If sleep is not getting better I have to tapper it off or take less than 5mg (insomnia started at 5, 4 mg was still ok)"
