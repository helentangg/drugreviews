"I was severely depressed with huge mood swings, anxiety and really stressed. When I first started taking these, the initial side effects were overwhelming, so bad that I had to stay off work. They made me more anxious, sick and really dizzy. I also really struggled to sleep if I took them at around teatime. This made me take them every other day or twice a week because they made everything seem worse ( even though I knew deep down they would help) after about 3.5 week of beating around the bush with them I felt no side effects and then took them everyday. After about a week I felt uplifted, that shadow and helplessness gone and it gave me the courage to leave my house and go to the gym. I take them everyday now and I feel better everyday"
