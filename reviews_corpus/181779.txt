"I have been on Prozac for only 6 days. I noticed a mild improvement where my depression episodes weren&#039;t so severe. The thoughts of suicide are subsiding, but I&#039;m beginning to feel a bit absent minded. There are times of the day that I feel very tired or sleepy, but I don&#039;t feel like crying or over reacting for everything. My doctor said that the level needs to build up in my system.  I hope I keep feeling better and the blah feeling improves. Decreased libido? I didn&#039;t have much to begin with. I noticed no change."
