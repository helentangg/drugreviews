"Have anxiety and depression and have been on medicines for 20 years.  Have taken Paxil, Zoloft, Prozac, Wellbutrin, Lexapro. Just switched 3 weeks ago from Prozac/Wellbutrin to Brintellix with Wellbutrin.  Feel fantastic - much better mood, clear head, no anxiety. No side effects at all.  Taking 10mg."
