"I have been on several different SSRIs before and haven&#039;t seen much improvement. So far, this seems to be the only antidepressant that&#039;s worked for me and hasn&#039;t given me too many side effects. I was on Luvox, which wasn&#039;t helping at all for any of the multiple conditions it was prescribed to treat, and was switched to an equivalent dose of Prozac. Ever since starting it, I&#039;ve had more energy and have been able to smile, laugh, and overall just feel like a normal person. For me, in combination with Seroquel, Adderall (for ADHD, but also gives what I take for depression a little boost), and Wellbutrin, this is a wonder drug. It still helps me get through every day after quite a few months on it. Couldn&#039;t say the same about other SSRIs."
