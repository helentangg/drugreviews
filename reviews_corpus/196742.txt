"I started Paxil approx 3 weeks ago and my life started changing for the better about 2 weeks into it.  I feel my social anxiety dissolving, I didn&#039;t realize how depressed I was, but life is starting to look so much brighter.  I suffered with bad pe which made sexual intimacy impossible, and this has pretty much gone away.  I am becoming more outgoing and able to express myself to others and working hard to remove everything in my head which caused my anxiety by talking with my spouse and others in my family.   I am also becoming much more comfortable in social situations.  I sure hope in continues, because I can&#039;t imagine going back to my old self.  I had bad nausea and was so tired the first week, but so worth it."
