"Migraines 1/2 month &amp; regular headaches from 16 until 40, after car accident 10 months ago getting terrible migraines 2-3 a week &amp; headache around the clock, having trouble working &amp; doing anything productive, addicted to pain medication.  After everything physical came back clear, prescribed amitryptiline 25mg which got rid of migraine/headaches but left me foggy/dizzy and with very dry mouth. Went back to 10mg, has gotten rid of the side effects, in the 7 or so months I&#039;ve been taking it have had 1 migraine and hand full of headaches that have been eased by asprin or ibuprofen. Has given me a new lease on life, risk of weight gain has been reversed by having energy to exercise and have actually lost 20 lbs &amp; put on bulk"
