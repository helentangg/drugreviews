"I have extreme anxiety and major depression. For me, all SSRI&#039;s, SSNRI&#039;s make me feel extremely weird. Almost as if my body feels &quot;too good&quot; but not in a good way. The only way to describe it is like jolts of electric shocks throughout my body that feel good. Also when I yawn or take a deep breath my teeth start to chatter. It also creates extreme erectile dysfunction for me to the point where it burns when I urinate. Unfortunately these are symptoms I cannot put up with, even though it does work."
