"In 2003, I had initially tried Remeron to deal with anxiety/insomnia but after 4 months and going through major depression, I started on Effexor.  I took Ativan to get me through the first few weeks for anxiety until the Effexor kicked in.  It definitely helped me get my life back.  My only problem is the weight gain - about 25 lbs.  I have tried to wean myself down from my highest dose of 225mg/day to as low as 37.5mg but had reoccuring depression and anxiety so have gone back up."
