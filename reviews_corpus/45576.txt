"I&#039;m 14. I started using prozac because I have OCD and anxiety. I am on day 4 with prozac and I feel like I&#039;ve lost all my emotions and I feel a bit dumb. It&#039;s a wierd feeling. I really don&#039;t know how this medicine will turn out but all I can say is that right now I feel worse than I probably ever could. I cried three times yesterday. Is this normal to feel dumb and feel so sad and anxious and why does the medicine do such a thing at first? I know that my body is trying to get used to it and all but I am really curious about how this medicine works (tecnically). What is it trying to do? and will it destroy my emotions???and will I have to use it for my whole life or smth?"
