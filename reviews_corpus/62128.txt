"This medicine is incredible. I had about four months of out of the blue, never had it before in my life terrible panic and anxiety. I was to the point I was throwing up every morning and constantly worrying and thinking about it. I finally went to the Dr. after crying and feeling miserable for days/months. She prescribed me Celexa 10mg to ween on (minimal side effects nauseous and a little more tired than usual, but I take it at night) then a month later I went to 20mg and I&#039;m happy there. Absolutely no more anxiety or panic and I don&#039;t feel like an emotionless zombie I feel just like myself. My sex drive is normal just takes a bit longer to get there."
