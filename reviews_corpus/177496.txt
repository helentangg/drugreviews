"I was on 60 mg for 3 months, then bumped up to 90 mg and it has been approximately 6 weeks since then. I had a few restless nights for the first week, and a few night sweats but no other side effects.I have chronic Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder (DPD) for 20 years now, and I have tried around 20-25 different medications as NONE of the available psychotropic meds have been shown to be very effective for DPD. I also take 1 mg Klonopin everyday. Out of all the SSRI&#039;s/SSNR&#039;s I have tried, Cymbalta by far has been the best at &quot;opening&quot; up my mind. Emotions (sadness and anger) that I have repressed since childhood have surfaced, allowing me to feel more real and connected to the world. Also the lower back pain I sometimes had is gone :)"
