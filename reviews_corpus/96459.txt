"I started on 50mg of Zoloft around 8 or 9 months ago, and it helped me a lot. Recently I went and got my dosage upped to a 100mg due to a few traumatic things, I became very, very depressed. That was about three months ago and I feel a lot better, not 100% but better none the less. I never really noticed any side effects, except gritting my teeth at night, and I do think it makes me a little drowsy. As far as sexual side effects I&#039;ve had none, unlike the previous two medications I tried."
