"After nearly 20 years of anxiety and depression, I am finally free.  Zoloft has improved my life beyond belief.  No more blushing, feeling uncomfortable or uneasy.  The first 2 weeks were tough (nausea, loss of appetite, trembling, etc.), but boy am I glad I stuck it out.  A 100mg pill to a new life.  

I thank god everyday that I found a doctor and a medication that have given me my life back.  A night and day difference."
