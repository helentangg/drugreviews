"Before I was to start this medication I searched and thought I better not take this medication because of all the people who said it was very bad.  I have been on Celexa since 2000 with ativan 3 mg per day if needed. I had to get off of Celexa because I started having panic attacks and wasn&#039;t working for me. It didn&#039;t really work that great for for the past six years. I was terrified to take Effexor XR. Well I couldn&#039;t live with panic and anxiety anymore so I took it.  I focus better, I don&#039;t dwell on things. I can sit and watch a movie without my mind wondering or worrying. I have lost 15 lbs. My husband notices a difference being more outgoing.   Don&#039;t listen to what has been written. I wish I started this a long time ago.  Best of Luck"
