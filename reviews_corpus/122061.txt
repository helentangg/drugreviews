"I&#039;ve been on Effexor for about two years.  Previously, I was taking Lexapro and went off it for a short period of time.  I returned to my doctor and he prescribed Effexor, 75 mg/day.  I experienced improvement with my anxiety, depression and panic attacks.  Like everyone else, I feel it (dizzy, hungover like symptoms) when I miss a daily dose.  I experience constipation and don&#039;t sleep as deep or through the night like I used to.  These side effects are on the list for this medicine - so, no surprises here.  I give this a rating of 9 because it is very helpful to relieve the symptoms of my depression, anxiety and panic attacks.  And, it helps to control my moods so I can better manage my emotions."
