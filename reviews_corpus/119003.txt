"Years ago I was taking Zoloft for depression.  I was not taking it for Trichotillomania, though I had been pulling my hair out of a long time.  It wasn&#039;t until I stopped taking Zoloft and started back pulling my hair out that I even realized I had stopped!  It was the only medicine that ever helped and I wasn&#039;t even expecting it too.  Unfortunately I can&#039;t take it long-term because it causes me to have facial tics which over time become very painful.  But most people don&#039;t have that problem."
