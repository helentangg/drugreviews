"Prozac changed my life, I suffered with rapid mood changes several times a day. My relationships struggled in all parts of my life but mostly romantically. I started taking Prozac when things got really bad while I was pregnant. Almost 2 months after I started taking it a tragedy happened and I couldn&#039;t understand why I felt so peaceful and content but then I realised I wasn&#039;t feeling in such extreme ways and that I had felt the same mood for at least 3 days. I think that was the happiest realization I&#039;ve ever had. I&#039;ll never forget the day."
