"After a back injury and subsequent surgery I tried several medicines for the lingering nerve pain in my left leg.  Nothing worked without severe side effects until trying Cymbalta.  The first couple of weeks the nausea was almost unbearable but I toughed it out hoping for some relief of the aching in my left leg.  Pain pills had zero effect on the radiating pain so my doctor prescribed Cymbalta.  It did take a couple of weeks to see any relief to my pain.  Although the pain is not totally gone it has gone from a 10  down to a 7 so for me this is a great improvement."
