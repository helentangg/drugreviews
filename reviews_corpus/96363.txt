"I have been on Lexapro, Remeron, Citalopram, and now I am on Zoloft and Xanax for my anxiety and depression. I have been taking Zoloft for 3 days, and I am taking half of my 50mg dose for a week as the doctor said. The first day I took it I felt a sense that I was on top of the world, I didn&#039;t have any problems talking to people as I used to. I&#039;m not sure if this was placebo, or if this drug is actually working. None of the other pills had worked for me. So far I have not experienced any changes in libido, but I have noticed my palms get clammy more than they used to. I am going to stick with this one for awhile."
