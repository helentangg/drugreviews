"I started taking Effexor XR 37.5mg capsules 2 months ago.  I had a hard time for the first couple of days.  I would wake up in the mornings feeling afraid and hot.  But my loved ones convinced me to stick it out.  I continued taking my medicine each day...at the same time each morning.  And I wish I would have started taking it a long time ago!  I can concentrate.  I can focus on what my children are saying to me.  Things that used to be overwhelming are no longer.  I can go out in public and feel confident...not feel like the walls are closing in on me.  Effexor XR changed my life for the better."
