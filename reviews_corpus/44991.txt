"This is for the person who is nervous to start this medication. DON&#039;T BE. I was nervous and six months later I am feeling so much better than before.

I currently take 10MG of Fluoxetine (Prozac) and also 0.5MG time release Xanax XR at bed time. I believe both have kept me on a great track from having panic attacks.

I was honestly in a not so good place with my panic disorder. I had tried other medicine and did not see much of a help. My psychiatrist listened to my feelings and told me to give this a shot.

The first month or so I didn&#039;t really feel too much of a difference. Felt pretty ok. I added the Xanax XR. The two in combination keep me very stabilized and feeling pretty good each day. Give this medicine and shot and stick to it!"
