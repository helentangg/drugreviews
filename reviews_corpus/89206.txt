"I have had panic attacks and anxiety for many years.  This year, I found out that I had colon cancer, got referred to a surgeon and had surgery within 2 weeks.  I found that the panic attacks and anxiety, sometimes sadness and crying bouts started as I began to recover and process this experience.  My doctor recommended Celexa over Cymbalta because she said that with women in particular, this was better for anxiety as opposed to depression. So far, I&#039;ve found that the drug makes me sleepy and a little muddled in thinking right after I take it.  I did have some nausea, but that went away quickly.  I&#039;m switching to taking it at night since I feel pretty good about 12 hours after taking it.  It does relieve anxiety and am panic attacks."
