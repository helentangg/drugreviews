"I noticed on day 4 that I became calmer, and my attitude is totally positive now, nothing bothers me, and at work, on IT helpdesk, the employees who call in ask what I have been smoking because I&#039;m so nice.  I&#039;m sure this is a good thing, but I feel a little goofy sometimes, like my brain won&#039;t work, and I fell in front of the office the other day but I wasn&#039;t dizzy.  I caught the toe of my shoe in a crack of the sidewalk and went down before I even knew I was falling.  I fell hard. I have sexual side effects and can&#039;t climax anymore but I don&#039;t miss it cause my desire has been taken away as well.  On the whole, I like it.  Buspar made me sleepy and I want to lose the Anxiety without any sleepiness, so this works."
