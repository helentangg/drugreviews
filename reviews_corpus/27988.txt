"I&#039;ve been on this medication for 2 1/2 months now, so I&#039;m not sure if that&#039;s long enough to judge this medication, but here I go. I am a 21 year old male, and I&#039;ve had anxiety for as long as I remember, and on and off depression since I was about 15. This medication works FANTASTICALLY for both anxiety and depression. Both symptoms are at an all time low, and I love this medicine for that. Unfortunately, side effects are present, and for me, never went away. I ALWAYS feel tired on this medicine (as a result, caffeine is my best friend). Because of the side effects, I don&#039;t particular recommend this medicine, but everyone&#039;s body works differently, and it may be right for you."
