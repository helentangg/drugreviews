"Prescribed for nightmares and night terrors due to PTSD. trazadone gave me a horrible body buzz and made me feel like I wasn&#039;t in control of my faculties. Worse off, it didn&#039;t stop the nightmares, just made it harder to wake from them. 

Doxepin was prescribed at 25 mg capsule, increasing to 75mg over a period of a month. Stopped the nightmares and night terrors instantly, with no body buzz. In fact, I don&#039;t dream at all anymore, and I&#039;m okay with that. Miracle drug. I was becoming desperate and fought sleep as long as I could so I didn&#039;t have nightmares. This saved my sanity."
