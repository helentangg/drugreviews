"I love this medication! I have been on it for about a year and it has made my life so much better.  I had been living with severe anxiety and depression.  After starting lexapro, I had some side effects such as the weird dreams, nausea, dizziness, and increased anxiety.  After 2 weeks, I started to feel so much better!  I now have less anxiety and I have not had a panic attack in 6 months! It is amazing how great I feel.  Finally, I can live my life like a normal 24 year old!  My advice to anyone who is on this medicine is to stay on it!  It is worth it!"
