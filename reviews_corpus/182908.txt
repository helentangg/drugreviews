"Cymbalta 120mg for 4 months
Good:
- slight to moderate increase in motivation, mental energy and attention/alertness.
- decrease in anxiety and depressive feelings.
Bad:
- made me less social, less empathetic and more robotic.
- horrible withdrawal symptoms which happen quickly if you forget to take it.
- when my dosage was increased from 30mg to 60mg, it started to give me nightmares at night and caused me to wake up in middle of the night and lose sleep.

Conclusion: Better positive cognitive experience than 10mg Escitalopram which other than positively affecting my mood, all it did was cause constant brain fogs and decrease my motivation even further."
