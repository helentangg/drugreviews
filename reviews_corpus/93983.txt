"First time using an anti depressant this long. I have tried others and couldn&#039;t stay on them for more than one day because of terrible dizziness and other strange side effects. I&#039;m only on 5 mg because I have a low tolerance for any type of medication. I did experience some nausea     but I sleep well and feel a lot better than I did before taking this...if you are also someone who doesn&#039;t believe in anti depressant medicine but has tried natural alternatives that haven&#039;t worked I would definitely give this a try on a low dose very good medication!"
