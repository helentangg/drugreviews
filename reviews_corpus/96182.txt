"It is 2012 Jan. and I have been battling depression and anxiety for the last 5 months, I was managing it up until 8 weeks ago. I started taking Remeron (30mg)for 7.5 weeks and it did not help at all, when I upped the dosage the nightmares were so bad I had to stop immediately. Now I am on day 2 of Zoloft. Day 1 was fine I was laughing and felt so good, day 2 I took the medicine at 9:30pm went to bed at 10:30pm and woke up in at 1:30 am with my heart beating so fast, and a nervous wreck. It took hours before I could go to bed even with my 1.5mg of Ativan.  I just bought a Light Therapy Machine and am also using that trying to combat this. I&#039;m really nervous about the next couple of days on Zoloft after my night of panic and deep anxiety."
