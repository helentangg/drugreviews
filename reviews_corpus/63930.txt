"After trying several antidepressants to treat depression, anxiety, and PTSD, I found Zoloft was my preferred choice. My depressive symptoms became tolerable, but only because the Zoloft put me in a fog. I was less energetic, way less motivated, and felt like a vegetable - but I was softer and less [emotionally] abusive, so I continued for the sake of my loved ones.
I gave it a low score because the withdrawal has felt like torture. I experienced massive panic attacks, fits of anger/violence, the &quot;brain zaps&quot;, muscle spasms, sexual complications, etc. On the plus side, coming out of the Zoloft &quot;fog&quot; has meant more creativity, motivation, energy, focus, and overall quality of life. I would urge others to strongly reconsider getting on Zoloft."
