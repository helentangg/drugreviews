"Just finished coming of Oxycontin after 6 years of use. Took Effexor 75mg throughout. Now a member of NA and tried to wean myself off - horrible side effects from the withdrawal, dizziness, panic attacks, severe depression and social withdrawal. Went back on at 75mg and now feel that the drug is pretty hard to get used to again. Can&#039;t seem to win."
