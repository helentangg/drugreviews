"I was diagnosed with severe PTSD, have struggled with eating disorders not specified, and major depression. Two years ago I began taking Pristiq after having tried Lexapro, generic Zoloft, Zoloft, and even Prozac. All of the previous medicines had horrible side effects like weight gain, night sweats, hallucinations, and mood altering capabilities. Pristiq was the first medicine that made me feel &quot;normal again&quot;. I got on it, began taking it steadily and not drinking on it. I was relieved of anxiety, weight gain and depression. After my boyfriend found out I was on it, I quit cold turkey due to some inhumane remarks. I DO NOT suggest coming off it suddenly EVER! I went downhill so fast; Pristiq truly is a miracle medicine!"
