"250lbs, 6&#039;2, male.. Am taking 5mg Lexapro for about a week, and either it is this or the Lamictal (100mg), but I&#039;ve experienced reduced anxiety, I was wondering if it just reduces the Anxiety or also reduces the symptoms because I still get pounding  and increased heart beat, my blood pressure is usually 20 points high, I take Lisinopril and used to get 120/80 , now I get 140/80 with the lisinopril, Lexapro and Lamictal. Other things I&#039;ve heard is if you go off Lamictal cold turkey, you&#039;ll get seizures. I&#039;m staying on 5mg, I figure if the dose is upped, it overloads the system and is maybe what leads to tolerance, so I&#039;m staying with a small dose until I feel ready to up it."
