"Worked okay but caused fainting spells. Coming off of it (tapering, per doctor&#039;said orders) was terrible. I&#039;ve been told more than once that the way I felt sounded like a heroin addict coming off heroin. I was sick to my stomach,  my entire body was in constant pain, every joint and muscle, headaches, I felt cold one minute and burning up the next, exhausted but couldn&#039;t sleep, nightmares when I could catch a few minutes  and periods of wishing someone would just put me out of my misery. This drug  is dangerous! Imagine if someone ran out and couldn&#039;t taper off. "
