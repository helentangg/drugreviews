"Truly wish I had accepted my depression and sought help years ago. This medication has completely cleared my mind and has helped me dramatically in the first two weeks of use. Although it caused insomnia for the first two days of use and I felt like a space cadet for the first 3 it helped me ease my moods and somewhat doesn&#039;t even allow my mind to wander into negative feelings. Highly recommended seeking help and support with this medication although I do suggest beginning treatment over the weekend to be adjusted before a work week."
