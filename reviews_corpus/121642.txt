"I am not only trying to help my depression but I&#039;m trying to find something to help my ADHD symptoms. ... my psychiatrist said this would help as a non stimulant because I am really sketchy about trying adderall or something similar.   Well my experience with Venlafaxine was that I developed twitches! Involuntary twitching is incredibly annoying. ... so back to fluoxetine.  I did feel more focused... but the twitching is not tolerable enough for me"
