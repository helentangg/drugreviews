"I have been on Brintellix for 5 weeks. I am feeling more and more like my regular self. My primary issue is GAD. I am finding that I am able to focus and concentrate better, my thoughts are not as obsessive, my motivation is increasing. My psych said that I need to give it another few weeks for maximum efficacy. I just hope things keep improving. Primary side effect at start up was nausea. But it went away after a few days."
