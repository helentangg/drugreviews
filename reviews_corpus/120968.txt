"I was prescribed this drug due to very stressful and lack of help at work, the company l worked for refused to help me in a very busy office always manned by two staff and made to run the office by myself. 
I worked on till l cracked and had to seek help, l was placed on a very high dose in the first instance and laid off work through ill health.
I am now on this medication for life as l cannot get off this drug through the side effects of a &#039;buzz like static electricity at the back of my head&#039; this gets so bad that l feel like passing out at times. This is why l will be on this for life.
If l had known this at the outset l would not have taken it, but nothing explained so, through ignorance and placing my trust in the doctor, l suffer."
