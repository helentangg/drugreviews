"I am 42 years old never took AD drug before. My GF insisted that I should take it for my anger issues, nothing violent but bursting rage in  a second, and feel depressed. Started to take the drug 6 months ago, for 2 weeks 50mg, after that 100 mg daily. Don&#039;t get me wrong but I don&#039;t feel any changes, my bursts are gone and depression like a normal person (daily problems thoughts). 
I am trying to say I feel normal :) I think it works"
