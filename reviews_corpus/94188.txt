"Was put on this because my Lexapro stopped working, and I was experiencing panic attacks. Dr said off label use for Brintellix is used for depression and anxiety. Started on the 5mg dose, didn&#039;t do much, was on that dosage for two to three months, went up to the 10mg, started having constipation (which is very unusual for me), my night vision got worse, and something about the medication seemed to be activating for me and that made my anxiety and panic attacks worse. About a month ago started tapering off it, but was still dealing with anxiety and anxiety attacks. Decided to try the Lexapro again. Luckily it has started working again and my anxiety has been gratly reduced, and panic attacks have gone away on 10 mg generic Lexapro"
