"I&#039;ve been taking Lexapro for a week now to help me keep mellow like jello. I&#039;m not taking anything else. I work 3rd shift. So my nights are days. And days are nights. This makes makes me extremely sleepy by the end of the week. I have only been on it for a week. This last Friday after I got off work. I fell asleep in recliner from 8:00am to 1:00pm got up ate a bite. Went to bed. I woke up to go to the bathroom a few times. But didn&#039;t get out of bed till 11:00pm Saturday. I have not left my bedroom, or ate anything. I don&#039;t feel like doing anything or going anywhere. I will be calling my doctor Monday and talking to him about how it makes me feel. "
