"Cymbalta was a God send for me.  Started off on Savella for NY fibromyalgia pain but had to go off of it because of increasing anxiety.  Started Cymbalta and felt almost pain free within 2 days.  It also helped with depression I didn&#039;t even realize I had.  I keep ibuprofen 800 mg on hand for breakthrough pain.  I feel better now than I have in years.  The only drawback for me is I seem to have picked up a urinary incontinence/retention issue which is a major annoyance otherwise I love Cymbalta."
