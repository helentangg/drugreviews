"I am 34 year old female.. I am on Doxepin to help me sleep.. I have had SEVERE eczema for years- NOTHING helps except prednisone ( on that now all the time too) but I couldn&#039;t sleep due to constant scratching.. Slowly increased Doxepin until Im now at 100mg taken at night ( sometimes depending how tired I am I only take 50-75mg) but Its my miracle pill.. Puts me to sleep ( almost instantly) and 99% of the time im not tired or groggy in the morning... I have heard however-there is possibility of weight gain and thinning hair at which both possibilities would cause me to look for a different medication.."
