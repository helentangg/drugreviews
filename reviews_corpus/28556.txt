"I had irritable bowel syndrome for 6 years and in the last 3 years it was preventing me from having a good quality of life. I was too anxious to do so many things because I couldn&#039;t trust my body to hold it together for any length of time. I tried hypnosis, mindfulness and naturopathic treatments but then asked my doctor about SSRI antidepressants. The first few weeks are awful but stick with it. I was in emergency because I had a panic attack and thought I was dying. I am now on 15mg Lexapro. It has been 3 months and this is truly a miracle. I feel totally normal and feel every emotion except I just think and ruminate less. I don&#039;t obsess anymore about leaving the house-I just leave. The drug has also been constipating for me, which after 6 years of irritable bowel syndrome is incredible. Highly recommend. "
