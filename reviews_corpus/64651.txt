"I was put on sertraline six years ago after my previous SSRI, Luvox, became ineffective.  I have found it effective at controlling my depression and anxiety, but there have been some major drawbacks.  Primarily, I find myself unable to achieve orgasm during intercourse.  Also, earlier this summer, I tried reducing my dosage from 150 mg to 100 mg - and I got a taste of SSRI withdrawal syndrome, which really, really, really sucks - a veritable hell on earth.  I am currently looking into changing to a better tolerated drug."
