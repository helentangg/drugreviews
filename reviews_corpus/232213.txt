"This pill has changed my life. I had no idea how bad I suffered from anxiety until I started taking this. I take 20mg a day and after a month I noticed a huge change. It&#039;s been 2 months now and I feel like myself again. I&#039;m so glad I decided to see my doctor and get help. I can&#039;t believe I lived for so long being so miserable. I have so much fun now doing things I couldn&#039;t do when dealing with my anxiety. I love going out and meeting new people when before I could barely leave the house to grab the mail without having crazy fears. I am able to talk about my anxiety openly to anyone now too which is a huge change. The only problem I have is sleeping, which my doctor had to prescribe another drug for that."
