"Was on 10mg for 1 yr... not much change. Switched to 20mg for two weeks then doctor bumped it up to 30mg/day. I think it might help depression but I feel its doing very little to help anxiety. Don&#039;t like the idea of having to be dependent on medicines to make me feel normal. Stick with it awhile longer."
