"I started Zoloft after being on citalopram. Citalopram worked the best for me but due to my age, my GP wouldn&#039;t raise the dose after 25mg stopped helping. I&#039;ve been on Zoloft since around February or so and it&#039;s increased my anxiety dramatically. To the point that I can&#039;t sleep and I&#039;m writing this at 4:49am. I also noticed I started to struggle with death anxiety A LOT which I hadn&#039;t had problems with in the past. I am still taking Zoloft but will hopefully be changing medication in the next few weeks."
