"I have major depressive disorder. I was put on Lexapro, the side effects were unbearable. I got switched to Prozac dosage got switched for a couple of months and then got put on sertraline, became suicidal. I gave up for a year on medications and tried exercising but still had bad depression and was tired but couldn&#039;t sleep at all. Now, I&#039;ve been on Pristiq for 9 days and some days I&#039;m in amazing moods and some I&#039;m really quiet and still have trouble sleeping but these reviews help me not want to give up yet. Thank you!"
