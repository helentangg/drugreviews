"Celexa has given me my life back! I suffered from severe anxiety and depression to the point where I would just lay in bed for days.  I didn&#039;t want to go anywhere, and cancelled plans with friends all the time just to stay home and sleep. It took about a month to work and now I feel great! I am back to my old self - I love going out, seeing friends, exercising, reading, everything I used to do and I&#039;m happier than ever! My only side effects were the first 2 weeks - anxiety was worse, insomnia, no appetite. That&#039;s gone now and I have no complaints. If I take it in the morning, I sleep well. If I take it at night, I can&#039;t sleep. You just have to learn what&#039;s best for you!"
