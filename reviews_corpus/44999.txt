"Developed panic disorder with agoraphobia one year ago after a traumatic experience on a plane. I finally gave in and decided to start treatment with Prozac. I was on 20mg for 3 weeks, then upped to 40 mg. No bad side effects AT ALL. My mood and attitude have improved greatly, and my daily panic attacks have diminished. When I do feel anxious occasionally, I am able to breathe it out and calm down, instead of ending up in the ER. I am now able to leave the house and drive, shop, run errands with no panic. I am still unable to travel by plane... otherwise, 10/10! And I am only on week 5. Heard it only gets better!"
