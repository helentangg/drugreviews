"Was put on this medication for Depression and Anxiety and am glad to say it has worked for me. Biggest change I have noticed with Escitalopram is how much I can focus now in my studies, concentration levels are much better. Mood is now generally a lot more balanced although do have my down days, however am almost happy for this as I am glad I am not going numb. Overall very positive experience, have not experienced any negative side effects and even feel I fall asleep a lot faster"
