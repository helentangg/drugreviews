"I have never been on any anxiety or depression medicine ever, but I have suffered severely, emotionally and financially in the last 3 years.  Everything came to a head about 2 months ago.  I went to a psychiatrist for the 1st time yesterday and went on Pristiq this morning.  I guess it&#039;s too soon to officially review it but now I just have an overall sense of CALM.  Maybe a little bit of fogginess, but I&#039;m sure that will subside.  I have a baby and a toddler, plus I babysit and I felt so much less irritable than I did before.  I didn&#039;t have much of an appetite, so I hope weight loss will be an added benefit. Wish me luck!"
