"Started about 10 days ago, the first week was tough, sertraline kept me up and ruined my sleep cycle a bit, had a shaking jaw, low appetite, struggled to hold a conversation.
It&#039;s gotten a lot better, though. I wake up between 6 and 7 am, I feel like my energy is slowly coming back to me, I don&#039;t feel hopeless and suicidal. I&#039;m on a 6-month course of it and I&#039;m hoping I come out of this feeling good."
