"I&#039;ve been on Pristiq for a week and already feel like a new person. I was EXTREMELY hesitant to take the medication because I had tried other antidepressants in the past without success plus there seems to be nothing but negative written about the drugs. I take no other medications and am a healthy 42 year old. I had a few days of nausea which was relieved mostly by taking the medication in the morning with food. I have a little dry mouth and use the bathroom a little less but otherwise have no side effects. I feel like a film was lifted off me. It&#039;s hard to explain. I hope to continue to feel as balanced as I do now. I&#039;m taking this for anxiety and dysthmic depression. The drug company offers assistance with co-payment. "
