"I&#039;d been taking Cymbalta for about 2 years when I decided that I didn&#039;t want to pay $30/mo anymore, so I decided that I would wean myself off. I tried and I started getting the brain zaps, like lightening in my head. So I started back, slowly I just started missing a dose here and there until I was able to stop them without the side effects. I&#039;ve been off for several months now and I&#039;ve noticed that I&#039;ve been in more pain and everything that was hurting me before has compounded. So needless to say I&#039;m starting them back. Appears that I&#039;m not going to be able to do without it."
