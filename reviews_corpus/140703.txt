"Lexapro has saved my life. I&#039;ve been so terrified to take anything for 3 years. My anxiety/panic was almost constant. I got to the point where I was convinced I was gonna be admitted to a mental Institute it was bad. I feared that taking it would make me crazy (esp reading some other reviews) but I got so bad I figured it couldn&#039;t get much worse.I feel so much better. If you&#039;re like me and afraid to take anything,give it a try."
