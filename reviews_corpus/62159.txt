"Been depressed since 13 years old. Didn&#039;t take an antidepressant until late 50&#039;s. Resisted, tried everything else. Still have to do work, like therapy, exercise, diet, rest, mental care, but this is like a Miracle for me. Never even knew how depressed I was before. Now I am only anxious. Ha ha. Have to work on that, but it is much better to be anxious than, anxious and depressed."
