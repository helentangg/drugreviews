"Herniated and degenerated disc, with sciatic leg pains, very disabling, unable to get about, get dressed or look after my child and dog in bad days, tried the usual fib off from Doctors and many prescribed medication, Amitriptyline works as pain relief but have been on several months now and always had very thick healthy hair, falls out excessively now and thinning, weight gain at fast pace was always a size 8 not now can&#039;t stop eating, still with pain but can look after my family just, side effects ae depressing for me but they manage the pain to a point after trying alot. Now looking into alternative healthy medication I&#039;m told from a sufferer of back and disc pain that I should stop taking this toxin and try hemp oil along with vitamins."
