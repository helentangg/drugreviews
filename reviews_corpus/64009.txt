"I&#039;m in my 40`s. I grew up in an abusive alcoholic family.  My dad was the alcoholic and my mom a crazy liberal. I developed PTSD, social problems, and severe anxiety. I set a new year resolution to try to resolve my issues.  I&#039;m not at all depressed or unhappy but the anxiety was overwhelming me to a point where I could not sleep. I finally caved in and went to a doctor and was prescribed Sertraline 25 mg.  For about the first 3 weeks I felt like a new man but I think I need to increase the dosage a bit because I still feel a little jittery.  Overall this medication has helped me tremendously!  I feel much better and I&#039;m not bothered by stress any more."
