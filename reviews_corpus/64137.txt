"Was prescribed this just over a month ago. The side effects have been minimal and now gone. My GP recommended I took it with my evening meal to minimise them and it worked for me. Within days I was sleeping better and even if I wake in the night I can get back to sleep unlike before when I&#039;d wake after a couple of hours with an overactive mind. I don&#039;t feel half as frantic, irritable and miserable as I did."
