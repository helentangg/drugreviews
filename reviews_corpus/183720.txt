"Was on 120mg for 2.5 years after trying most of the antidepressants on the market. It worked the longest and the best on my Treatment Resistant Depression (TRD) out of all the other SSRI&#039;s I&#039;ve been on over the last 10 years. Unfortunately, its effectiveness began to drop out and my depression came back so I had to switch to something else. If you have been taking this medication for an extended period of time and need to stop taking it, please wean slowly and do so only with the help of your doctor. Many people, including myself suffered for weeks from terrible withdrawal - symptoms included vomiting, dizziness, head spins, extreme fatigue and a worsening of depression symptoms. "
