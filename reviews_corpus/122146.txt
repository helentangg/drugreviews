"I am a mum of two. Been depressed in past but felt fine after birth to first baby and the following three years. Developed depression, anxiety, mania after second baby, almost immediately. I am now in hospital (mother and baby unit) with 9 week old daughter. I&#039;m on Effexor XR 375mg and experimentally with Seroquel (too sedating), Abilify (not effective) and now lithium. Effexor is causing mania like symptoms and I have been taking it for 4 weeks. The introduction of another medicine will hopefully counteract this. Overall though Effexor has definitely reduced my lows from a 1/10 to never dipping below 5/10. Fingers crossed I can get out of here and back to normal, soon."
