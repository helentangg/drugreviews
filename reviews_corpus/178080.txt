"I started taking 30 mg once a day of Cymbalta 4 weeks ago for Fibromyalgia and what a huge difference it has made for me. At the suggestion of my pharmacist, I take it in the morning after eating breakfast (helps prevent nausea) and I am more alert, aware, awake, able to function with less pain and fibro-fog and I&#039;m now sleeping better at night. I still wake up at 2-3 am but am able to fall back to sleep within a short time. On its own it has not taken the pain fully away but on most days it has brought it down to a level that is manageable with other techniques for dealing with pain (capsaicin rubs, Epsom salt baths, Tylenol, electric heating blanket). It has decreased my appetite and for me that&#039;s another plus!"
