"I have been on Lexapro 10 mg with a 150 mg Wellbutrin for almost 11 years. I started taking these after my divorce. The Lexapro especially has been a lifesaver. Very few things bother me. The Wellbutrin keeps me from being extremely tired. It has been a miracle for me. I did gain a lot of weight but I&#039;d rather be happy and fat then depressed and skinny."
