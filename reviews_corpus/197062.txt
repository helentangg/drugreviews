"I&#039;ve been on Paxil for 4 days and so far I have been staying up late, had a sore throat for few days and also been eating a lot. As far as my moods, I haven&#039;t felt any changes or anything as far as pulling me out of my depression shell. As far as I know, it doesn&#039;t start actually working until about 4-6 weeks."
