"I have suffered with depression for about 10 years, every time I&#039;d go to the doctors I was told &#039;it was just hormones&#039; or &#039;it&#039;s your pill&#039;. But about 18 months ago it became unbearable, I didn&#039;t want to be here anymore, I couldn&#039;t handle being on my own, I almost lost my job, I couldn&#039;t sleep, I literally couldn&#039;t make it through the day without having a breakdown. Since taking the tablets (150mg) my life has changed, for the first time in a long time I am genuinely happy with my life. I still have my moments, but I only get upset when something worth getting upset about happens, which I am glad for as my main fear was that the tablets would make me emotionally numb. I am so pleased I finally got the help I needed."
