"My doctor weaned me off of Paxil a few weeks ago as it wasn&#039;t working. Three days after the last dose was the start of the two worst weeks of my life. It included migraines, nausea, decreased vision, when I turned my head or moved my eyes there was a whooshing sound in my head accompanied by extreme dizziness. Then there were  the bouts of crying for no apparent reason. In summary I would call this poison not medicine."
