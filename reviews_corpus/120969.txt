"I&#039;m a 36 year old male with GAD and was prescribed 150mg of Venlafaxine for GAD and depression and was on it for 3 years. It helped with my anxiety really well but made me way too sedated and I was constantly tired.
Sex Drive went way down and the kicker is that we found out that it was decreasing my testosterone levels as well as my thyroid. I don&#039;t think it effect my levels for the first year or so, not that I noticed. I am an athlete so I could see major effects on the field about 1.5 years in and it felt like I had aged 10 years. Once I stopped the meds all my T levels went back to normal values. 
Everybody is different and it worked from an anxiety aspect but the side effects were not worth for me."
