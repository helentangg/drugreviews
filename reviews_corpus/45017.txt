"I was given this drug after going to my GP after months of feeling like I was the only person in the world feeling this way thinking I wasn&#039;t normal and that I couldn&#039;t tell anyone about how I felt. I felt depressed, anxious and after taking this for about 7 weeks I started to feel so much better like my old self again and then I thought I was fine and I stopped taking it but now I am back to being very anxious and uneasy about everything so I am starting them again I would not recommended you stop taking these pills even if you feel you are ready. Always talk to a GP first if you think it&#039;s time to stop. I 100% recommend anyone who feels like they need help to get better to try these out."
