"Started on 10mg while seeing a mental health professional (counselor) simultaneously. Medicine kicked in at about 3 weeks of treatment and got better when MD increased the dosage to 20 mg 6 weeks into treatment. It&#039;s been a consistent once daily oral capsule 20 mg for the past 3 1/2 months. Mood has lifted. Wakes up with clear thoughts. Lessened racing negative thoughts. Reduced anticipation of negative events and occurrences. Obsessive compulsive rituals reduced. Answer the phone with more ease and less concerned about making mistakes in front of people. Anxiety greatly reduced, lessened depressive thoughts. Definitely helps you to look forward to life. It works better to see counselor at same time so you can track progress."
