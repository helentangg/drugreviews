"I&#039;ve been taking Cymbalta (90) for three years because of back pain. I have four fusions in my lower back. I tried to go to 60, because of the unfortunate side effect with orgasm, but upped it back to 90 when my pain level went up. The biggest issue is with feeling dehydrated all the time - very dry mouth, I also seem to take more time to heal and get over respiratory infections."
