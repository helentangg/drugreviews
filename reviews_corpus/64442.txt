"I have terrible anxiety and occasional PTSD and panic attacks (which I also believe cause my ulcers and IBS). It got to be that I was so afraid of everything I&#039;d get myself physically sick.  I got the courage to tell my doctor and he prescribed Zoloft. I&#039;ve been taking half a pill this week and have to go to a full pill next week. It&#039;s absolutely amazing, my thoughts don&#039;t linger on every little thing now, I don&#039;t worry at all or panic. I don&#039;t assume people are mad at me anymore, I can sleep at night, and I can eat without getting sick. The first few days were ROUGH. I got literally every listed side effect, but they cleared up as the week went on. If it&#039;s working for you, keep at it, the side effects will go away."
