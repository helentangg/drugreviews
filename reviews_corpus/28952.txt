"I have been on Lexapro for a little over a month now. I immediately saw a change in my engery level. I got the motivation to get out of bed and be active again. My temper has subsided a lot. I used to cry a lot and I have not cried in weeks. I actually stop and think prior to showing anger. It has helped so much. I have not seen any fluctuation in weight. I have been sleeping more soundly. This is the first medication I have been put on for this medication and it seems to be working great."
