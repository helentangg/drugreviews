"Doctor prescribed this medication for my depression. I had tried taking three different brands of anti depressants over the coarse of several years. First one, I don&#039;t recall the name, but the side effects were too much for my 18 year old self to handle. Fast forward several years and events, I attempted Lexapro. First dose gave me severe anxiety and I slept only 2 to 3 hours. After discontinuing that, and going another year or so without much to help with how low and anxious I felt, I finally tried Sertralin (Zoloft). I was told to give it at least a month. I am not going to lie. It was rough. My stomach was a mess. More side effects and a month later, I started having patience with my kids again. I don&#039;t feel like crying all of the time."
