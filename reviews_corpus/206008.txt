"I&#039;m taking Pristiq for mild anxiety. Side effects include interrupted sleeping patterns, severe constipation, and decreased sexual drive/inability to have orgasm. Anxiety has decreased tremendously and I feel great (i.e. more patience, focused, clear headed), but not sure if side effects are worth it."
