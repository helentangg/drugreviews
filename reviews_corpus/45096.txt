"18y/o with anxiety/ depression  I was given medication for the anxiety originally and then the doctor gave me fluoxetine 20mg, this was fine the first week, no side effects.  Second week, I was living in a constant state of panic, beta blockers weren&#039;t helping and I always had chest pains and severe panic attacks. I couldn&#039;t stand to be in a classroom full of my peers, they made me feel paranoid about everyone. I absolutely hate these."
