"Doxepin does not help me fall asleep. It does help me stay asleep. I suffer from anxiety and depression and that&#039;s why I can&#039;t sleep. To those people who have experienced extreme tiredness the next day this also happens to me even though I take it as the manufacturer suggest for Sleep maintenance which is to take on a completely empty stomach 3 hours after a meal. Otherwise the onset is delayed even further. By several hours leading to next day sedation even more. Even when taking the proper way it has a 15-hour half-life which can still leave you tired and groggy the next day which I also experience even taking it correctly."
