"I started taking lexapro 2 years ago. I have always had bad nerves , but when my daughter graduated high school, I was suffering from the &quot;empty nest syndrome&quot;. Lexapro really helped me alot and the only fall back for me was my weight gain. I went from size 10 to 16 . I am going off from the medicine now and I think that I will do okay and if I ever have to go back on something it would be this. Good Luck!"
