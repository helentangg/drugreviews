"Paxil works consistently to alleviate my lifelong depression. I did have to bump up levels after the first 6 months of treatment. I have tried to stop treatment twice now but eventually overwhelming depression returns, particularly initiated by allergy seasons. So now ,  I  will just take it for life or until the doctor and I decide otherwise. I am statistically at an elevated risk of reoccuring depression so I just take the medicine. Weight gain is a problem but at least that doesn&#039;t depress me."
