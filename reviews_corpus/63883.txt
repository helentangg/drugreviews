"I am huge fan of this drug I&#039;ve been on it nearly 2 months and it took 6 weeks to work for me not a minute sooner.
I&#039;ve read a few reviews and loads of low reviews are people who took it for 3 weeks etc but  it needs a chance to get into your system.
It&#039;s changed my life totally I feel normal again first time in years.
My advice give it 2 months if nothing it&#039;s not for you.
Cheers"
