"I&#039;ve been dealing with anxiety for a very long time now, cried all the time, got upset over anything, always worried about something, had a horrible temper, and could never sleep or relax. I was always doing SOMETHING. I finally went to a doctor and told him everything that I was feeling and he prescribed me Lexapro 20mg.  I&#039;ve only been on it for a couple of days and its making me VERY sleepy, and I feel like I&#039;m not able to think. I&#039;m not to sure if I like this or if its just side effects, or maybe I need a lower dosage.  My mother is on the same medication and told me she felt the same way in the beginning.  Hopefully it goes away. All  your reviews have made me feel better about this medication.  Lets see how it works."
