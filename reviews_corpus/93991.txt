"December 2016 I started on 5mg of Trintellix. I&#039;d reached a point in life, 65, where my life was more than I could ask for: good job, strong marriage, good friends, healthy, and yet I lived a dark cloud of fatigue and disconnection, lacking excitement and motivation. I was just maintaining. So I tried Trintellix. I&#039;m now on 10mg. For me I&#039;ve had little to no symptoms, and a rebirth of joy, motivation, and creativity. I&#039;ve also added a weekly exercise routine at the local Planet Fitness. Between diet and exercise I find this modern medicine to be a miracle. Of course I realize my body will probably adjust to this feeling and I wont&#039; be quite &#039;euphoric&#039; forever, but I now know what feeling good feels like."
