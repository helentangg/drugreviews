"Hi All, I&#039;m a 26-year-old African American woman and I&#039;m so glad that I found Effexor (Venlafaxine, for me) because it has really helped me manage my anxiety and depression. It&#039;s not common to talk about medication in the Black community so if you&#039;re reading this and think that the drug might help you - just give it a try! My therapist said that Effexor really tends to help young women. I have been on the drug for 16 months and went from 75 mg to 150mg. I just checked in with my prescribing psychiatrist today and I figured I would take some time to write reviews for people who haven&#039;t made the jump to medication. I also use Beating the Blues CBT online tool - it&#039;s free at my job! The combination, plus eating healthy and working out, works!"
