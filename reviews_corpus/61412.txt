"I have been on it for about two weeks. It has not quite kicked in really but I thought I&#039;d review my experience thus far. I haven&#039;t really had any bad side effects as of yet, and I don&#039;t have any trouble sleeping on it either. I&#039;ve gotten some comments that I am more outgoing and talkative but I haven&#039;t noticed it so apparently it may be helping my anxiety some as well. At one month appt to review with my doctor I will probably have my dosage upped as it has had no effect so far on my depression. They started me at a low dosage tho bc my genetics test says that my body reacts to 10mg how a normal person would react to 20mg so they started me on 10mg. Hopefully it will have more of an effect when they up the dosage."
