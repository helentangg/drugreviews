"I feel like this medication is hit or miss. It either works really well or not at all. I started at 50mg a day at the beginning of 2015 and slowly increased to 200mg a day. At first I thought I was getting better, but it turns out I was just confusing feeling numb with feeling better. My dr kept increasing the dose but it didn&#039;t work and I eventually switched to a different medication. I experienced a few side effects: dry mouth, headaches, dizziness, those ones were manageable. But the sexual dysfunction side effect freaking sucked. I couldn&#039;t orgasm at all most of the time and when I could it took almost an hour to get there! Sooo yeah......that might be TMI but whatever. I&#039;m now on bupropion which is working wonders for me!"
