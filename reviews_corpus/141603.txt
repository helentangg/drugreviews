"I was prescribed 10mg for 2 weeks, then up to 20mg. Originally prescribed for anxiety, I also suffered from severe depression.

Within 3 weeks, I could see an improvement. My crying stopped, things were looking better! 

Been on for 2/3 months now, and I feel amazing! Back to my old self. I love this medication!"
