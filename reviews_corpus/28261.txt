"At first I thought lexapro was helping but the only positive aspect was that it slightly helped my thoughts not spin out of control but not enough to keep taking since the side effects were awful! Weight gain, bloating, and others but the worst was that I could NOT hold still.  I was constantly moving and restless physically!  It drove me and everyone around me insane. Coworkers complained, boyfriend complained. It was a nightmare and also NO sex drive. Got off.  Feel fine. So much better."
