"Started on 30 mg&hellip;took at night and couldn&#039;t sleep at all.  Took in a.m. and it really reduced pain and cognitive issues!  But I was so nauseated, headache, sweating, just sick.  Doctor said take every other day&hellip;that worked pretty well, so after a few weeks, I started back with one a day.  After 7 days, I was deathly ill again, so I went back to every other day.  The day off the med was great..no pain, feeling good.  The day on the med was awful&hellip;sick, headache, sweats.  Worse than before!  So I got switched to 20 mg&hellip;it is only slightly less poisonous.  It&#039;s been about 2.5 months&hellip;I am going to get off it.  There is no way this is better."
