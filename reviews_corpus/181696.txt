"I&#039;m hoping my posts will help others who are on the fence about antidepressants. My story - in short - is anxiety has plagued me since my teens, depression joined the parade in my late teens/early 20&#039;s. I have tried several medications over the years and because they either made me flat or sick I didn&#039;t stick with them. Recently decided Prozac would be my last attempt.

I started taking 20 mg every morning 2 weeks ago. I have had very little in the way of side effects. Some mind shakiness in the morning, little bit of difficulty falling asleep, mild fatigue, and dampened appetite. The benefits - to this point - are - surprising. I am much calmer, the anxiety is 80% gone, the depression is still present but not like 2 weeks ago and before. It&#039;s dissipating for sure. Life doesn&#039;t look so &quot;all or nothing&quot; which is a nice change.
My spouse said my &quot;fidgets&quot; are gone. I was almost constantly moving in some form or another.

I know some people think the medication reaction is &quot;all in ones head&quot; but since my problems ARE all in my head - I don&#039;t care if it&#039;s the medication, me thinking it is or a combination. All I can say is, for the first time in a very, very long time I am able to run errands, be more social and have actually gotten a full time job in the past 2 weeks. I am able to better care for myself now thus able to care better for my spouse.

I have no plans to stop the Prozac. With 20 mg/once a day being a low dose and with it helping to this point, I&#039;m going to roll with this as long as I can.
