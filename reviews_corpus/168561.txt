"I&#039;m a health care professional myself and was prescribed Viibryd for depression and anxiety. This medication is by far the worst medication I&#039;ve taken. I started taking the recommended dosage with the starter pack. I experienced all the side effects ( nausea, diarrhea, vivid dreams, zaps to the brain).  The worst is I ended up in the ER with a panic attack and these panic attacks have continued. Of course I&#039;m off this medication immediately recommended by the ER physician and my personal MD.    There are too many negative personal experiences with this medication. Even though everyone reacts differently, there is a correlation."
