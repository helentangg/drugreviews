"I have been taking this for almost three months for my anxiety. Since I started taking it I have had several headaches, been unable to sleep, had several severe panic attacks, had many small panic attacks, and have felt no difference in my anxiety levels. Maybe this is just my experience but I would not recommend this medicine for anyone with anxiety or panic disorders."
