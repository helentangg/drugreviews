"I&#039;ve suffered from migraines/daily headaches that painkillers don&#039;t touch; symptoms include visual and auditory disturbances, and sometimes even partial loss of vision. Sumatriptan&#039;s the only thing that works but I need to take it daily, often twice daily.

My GP was alarmed at sumatriptan use so prescribed me 10mg amitriptyline a night, and after a couple of weeks the migraines and headaches were gone. Worked so well I went months without using sumatriptan and eventually forgot about the headaches, and stopped the amitriptyline because of the sides (huge appetite, weight gain, next day drowsiness), and I&#039;ve had a migraine from hell for a week and I&#039;m back to taking sumatriptan daily.

Restarted amitriptyline, and I won&#039;t be stopping again!"
