"For my IC/PBS, I get bladder infections every two weeks, try as hard as I can to watch my diet (though it&#039;s difficult not to cheat), get pelvic floor physical therapy, take Uribel and Klonapin as needed, and take 25 mg of amitriptyline each night.  When I first started taking it, after about a couple of weeks, I felt completely normal for the first time in months.  No symptoms at all for about 4 weeks.  Now I have some creeping back.  I&#039;m going to try upping my dose to 50 mg each night and see how I tolerate it.  It does make you dopey in the morning at first, but that goes away eventually."
