"Within 2 hours of taking the medication, my brain lit up, it felt like I was high. I couldn&#039;t contain the energy, so I went for a run. By midway through the day I went to the park with my nephews, I took them on the swings. I thought I&#039;d go on with them, so I started swinging and it felt like I was going to die. The most terrible feeling of fear I have ever experienced. It felt like I was free falling. I had a total panic attack. At the end of it I freaked out and just needed to get home. Could barely drive or focus. By day two I started feeling terrible raw feeling in my stomach, fought the feeling of vomiting most of the day, exhausted detached. My brain would fluctuate between euphoria and complete inability to calculate or communicate."
