"What a life saver! And I mean that in the very literal sense.
I&#039;ve now been taking 20mg of Prozac for about 18 days. The fist week was hell. I couldn&#039;t sleep, I felt more depressed, anxious and panicky than before. Nauseous and disorientated. But stuck with it. Only now that I&#039;m starting to feel better, do I start to realize how incredibly unwell and out of control I&#039;ve been for so long. I&#039;m now starting to feel like I have my brain back and am in possession of rational thoughts again!"
