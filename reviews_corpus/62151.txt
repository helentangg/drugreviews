"I feel amazing. I was an absolute wreck, unreasonable. Paranoid, emotional, moody.  My boyfriend was at his wits end so I went to the DR&#039;s and was told I was depressed! I was so shocked but it all made sense.  I have been described 20mg of citalopram and I feel the effects already.  I feel a bit nauseous about 2 hours after taking the tablet and my sleep is affected but otherwise I no longer get overwhelmed, I don&#039;t feel paranoid and I don&#039;t feel at rock bottom at every little thing.  I am feeling so positive and my boyfriend is so happy to have the old me back.  Taking this medicine has made me realize just how bad I was."
