"I&#039;ve been on Lexapro twice. The 1st time started in the fall 2008. For some reason at the age of 42, I began having dizziness, anxiety, and panic attacks. I was diagnosed with GAD and prescribed 1 mg Ativan for use as needed in the short term and 10mg Lexapro for the long term. Within 3 weeks I increased to 20 mg Lexapro. Within another 3 weeks, my anxiety had all but vanished and I quit Ativan. My racing thoughts and worries subsided. I was able to sleep better at night and concentrate better at work. No weight gain either but I exercise regularly. I stayed on Lexapro for 1 yr. No problems getting off on a tapered schedule over 3 months. In spring 2011, anxiety returned due to marriage issues. Back on 10 mg Lexapro with same great results."
