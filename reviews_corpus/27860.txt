"This medicine was an extremely horrible experience for me. My doctor prescribed it to me for anxiety and day one sent me off the edge. How I felt during anxiety attacks was how this medication made me feel but fifty times worse. I felt like I drank a million milligrams of coffee and was on pins and needles for 8 hours. After reading these reviews I hate that it didn&#039;t have the same affect on me as it did the majority. I hate anxiety but I can&#039;t see myself taking another one of those pills EVER."
