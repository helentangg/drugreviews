"I began taking this medication October 2011 for depression and anxiety as recommended by general practitioner. (It is the only medicine for Depression/Anxiety that I have ever taken) I ramped up weekly from 0.5 to 15 mg. My doc wanted me on 20 mg per day but I decided 15mg was for me. I felt an immediate boost upon first taking only 0.5. Felt a sense of happiness that had been missing for many, many years.  At 15 mg I felt much less stressed and much happier overall. I could deal with friends, family and strangers much more easily. After a few months of doing well I noticed that the &quot;fog had set in&quot;, I had a hard time focusing on anything for an extended period. This was accompanied by increased anger and NO SEX DRIVE at all. I have now weaned myself off."
