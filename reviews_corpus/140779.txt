"I&#039;ve been on this med for over a month and the side effects do not out weigh my symptoms . The withdrawal sucks and the hyperness and the tiredness sucks. I&#039;m 31 and haven&#039;t been on a depressant since I was 15. I lost my sister 5 months ago and it set me into anxiety, panic and depression."
