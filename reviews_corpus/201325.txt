"I&#039;m on day 11 of taking Zoloft 25mg. Thus far, I hate this drug. Put on it for anxiety and panic attacks. Doc wouldn&#039;t prescribe Xanax as I have an addictive personality so wanted to avoid benzos altogether. I&#039;ve experienced all the side effects of this drug within the first three days. Headaches, dizziness, diarrhea and anxiety seems worse than before I was put on this. I keep reading that it takes four to six weeks for the drug to take effect and that it gets worse before it gets better. Is this true? I&#039;m supposed to try to stay on it a full month and go from there. I&#039;m 41 and female. And thus far, hate this drug."
