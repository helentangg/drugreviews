"I thank God for Lexapro! I have been taking 10 mg for a year now and it has worked wonderfully! Before Lexapro I had severe anxiety &amp; depression, now I am free of that!  I was also addicted to Xanax, taking like 3-4 mg a day, now I might take 1/2 mg once every 2 weeks.  I am working on not taking Xanax at all.  If have doubts about Lexapro,  please try it &amp; it WILL work!"
