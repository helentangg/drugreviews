"Went on these 8 weeks ago. 4 weeks on 10mg then 4 weeks on 20mg.  They&#039;ve just started to work properly and I feel much more positive.  To get the most benefit I&#039;ve had to stop drinking and improve my diet.

I was pretty depressed and having anxious thoughts for two years before taking these.  I&#039;ve taken Elavil, Remeron and Lustral before but not really had good results.  Felt odd at first but side effects have reduced.  Still having strange feeling yawns, slightly delayed and weaker orgasm (was much worse to begin with), along with a little insomnia.  I&#039;m putting up with these.  I think Lexapro is &quot;cleaner&quot; than the other SSRIs and more precise.  I plan to take these for a year and then take a break, but will need them again in the future."
