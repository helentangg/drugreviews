"I have been on and off citalapram for 14 years now. The most recent episode of my severe depression starred about 6 months ago. My gp put me on 20mg daily. I take it at night and it literally saved my life. I had suicidal thoughts was self harming and spent days in bed at a time. 
Now I feel normal I&#039;m not ashamed of taking a tablet daily to help either and advise anyone with depression to seek help before its too late"
