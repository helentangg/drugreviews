"My husband used to take Paxil &amp; was able to ween himself off successfully,over 6 years ago. Now,after being severely &amp; permanently injured at work,having spinal surgery 2 years ago, he has severe anxiety,with good reason! &amp; his doctors have put him on Valium, then Ativan, &amp; then Klonapin.  But recently, a new doctor asked him to try Lexapro. Boy what a wonder drug so far!! Very few side-effects,and it really gets him focused and happier!! If it continues,it will be a miracle for our family!!!!!!"
