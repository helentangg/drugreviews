"I love Paxil but I have to say I have pur on weight being on it and I have the most horrible vivid nightmares where I can&#039;t wakeup. I think it works great for anxiety but I think maybe this medicine has stopped working because I&#039;ve been on it so long it has improved my life for the better but I&#039;m thinking of changing now cause it just doesn&#039;t do the same for me anymore."
