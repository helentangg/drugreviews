"10 days I&#039;m feel a bit out of it- tired then wired but has alleviated the tense feeling from Pristiq 100mg &amp; 50mg isn&#039;t enough to keep all anxious depression symptoms away.  I think I need more of the S than the N in the SNRIs.  I&#039;ve taken zoloft previously with success but changed to Effexor then Pristiq for a little more motivation 4 years ago but it does cause weight gain for me compared to SSRIs. Prozac has killed my appetite &amp; don&#039;t even think about food- bonus!  I know it will improve in weeks. I started at 5 mg for 10 days kept taking Pristiq EOD I&#039;ll go to 10mg &amp;Pristiq every 3rd day then cut Pristiq. Don&#039;t do withdrawals &amp; why do people have obsession with trying to get off meds if they work stay on them of course you will crash you idiots!"
