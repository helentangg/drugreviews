"I took Citralopram in the hope it help with anxiety. First day had minor side effects. Just felt a bit spaced out. Like I couldn&#039;t think 100% clearly. A bit anxious. Didn&#039;t feel &#039;normal&#039;. 

Second day I thought I&#039;d try taking them in the evening instead, in the hope that the side effect would be less throughout the following day, This was a mistake. Couldn&#039;t get to sleep all night, tossing and turning, sweating, felt wired. 

Third day, Took in the morning again. The best way I can describe the feeling is the same as I feel the morning after taking ecstasy/ MDMA. Jaw clenching. dilated pupils. A kind of speedy, disconnected and weak feeling. On edge.

Decided to stop taking them but still feel weird 2 days on :/"
