"This medication saved my life. I was suffering through one of the worst bouts of anxiety I had ever been through, during an extremely stressful part of my life. When my doctor prescribed this for me I had my doubts, and had seen many bad reviews. I am here to let you know that this medication WORKS FOR ANXIETY. I know everyone is different, but anyone who is prescribed this for anxiety, PLEASE WAIT A FEW WEEKS FOR IT TO WORK. It didn&#039;t really work for me the first few weeks and I had some side effects but now  my generalized anxiety and agoraphobia have dissipated so much I can enjoy my life without constant suffering, I&#039;m so happy."
