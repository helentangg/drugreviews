"I&#039;m a male 44 years, and suffered anxiety for years. I could not drive on the freeway without panic attacks, and the fear of crashing. I went to countless doctors before I decided to try medication(Lexapro). It changed my life. It took about three months for me to feel like my old self again. I have no side effects, and I haven&#039;t had a panic attack in three years since I began taking it. Life is great thanks to Lexapro."
