"I was prescribed this medication at 21 for panic disorder 8 years ago. I was previously taking Zoloft which I was given at 16... I think the zoloft did enough but also at that young of an age there wasn&#039;t much adventure I was seeking yet so my panic attacks were controlled. I did still get panic attacks and my life was still significantly altered. They switched me to Effexor 75mg &amp; I gained 50 pounds in the first year. Panic attacks still present just less frequent. General everyday anxiety lessened. Tried few time to get off but I can&#039;t get past 37.5mg. Back on 75mg as of last week.  I  hate the first few weeks. Nightmares, appetite full force and generally light headed. It does calm the general anxiety down though but its still a difficult life."
