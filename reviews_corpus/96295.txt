"I have been on Zoloft for about 6 weeks.  I feel like a load has been lifted and I am not as irritated as I once was.  I found myself laughing and enjoying people.  My family was happy that I was feeling better and wanting to do things with them again. However, after about two weeks, I noticed that my hair started falling out.  I had more hair on the floor and in the bathroom than normal.  I now have a bald spot about the size of a fifty cent coin.  I have done some research and found out that Zoloft can cause hair loss. I hope my hair grows back."
