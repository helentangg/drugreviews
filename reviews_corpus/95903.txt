"Just like you, I was reading these reviews a few months  ago when I finally made the decision to give medication a try.  I hope this review helps and gives you comfort.

I&#039;ve been on 50 mg for seven weeks now.Started at 25mg for the first seven days.  The first two weeks saw a spike in anxiety just like I figured.  But I stayed with it, and I&#039;m so glad I did.  I had a pretty intense panic attack the first week, but I noticed something: I didn&#039;t stress out about having another one like I usually do.  By the third week the panic attacks and panicky feelings were pretty much gone.  I&#039;ve also noticed that my mood has lifted, and I can fall asleep much better at night.

This is my first ssri, and I really regret not seeking help sooner"
