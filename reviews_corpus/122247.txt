"I have not experienced the above-mentioned side effect of weight gain,  but notice that just missing a single dose gives me terrible headache and &quot;brain zaps&quot;. Hard to describe, but you&#039;ll know it if you ever have one. Other than that, I suppose it&#039;s an okay drug. I&#039;ve tried just about every antidepressant on the market, as well as mood stabilisers and even a few of the off-label medicines, which are prescribed to ease depression, but so far, this is the only one that has had ANY effect whatsoever. It takes the full 375mg to get any effect out of me though. I&#039;ve hit another low recently. I can&#039;t do anything about it but for the most part, my depression has improved, with no side effects except the ones I get if I forget to take it."
