"I have had a lot of additional stress added in the last 4 years... death of a parent, a lot of hurtful things from my other parent, my spouse cheating, then everyday things like the stresses of young children, school, sports, etc.
Over these years I have tried every antidepressant out there! It either didn&#039;t work, or it made me feel like a zombie. And they ALWAYS made my sex drive go to zero!
I had given up on every prescription and had not taken anything for almost a year. I had no energy, it didn&#039;t take much for me to get annoyed and aggravated with people (including my kids) and I just didn&#039;t feel a lot of joy.
My doctor tried me on Viibryd and I feel GREAT! I have great energy, don&#039;t lose my temper with my kids or husband, and still have sex drive!"
