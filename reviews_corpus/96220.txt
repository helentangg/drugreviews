"Currently take 75 mg of Zoloft per day to help with panic attacks and anxiety (no depression). Took about 1 month for my panic attacks to totally stop. Still had anxiety but now that I&#039;ve been on it for almost 3 months I have almost NO anxiety. Did experience a side effect of my jaw clenching starting in the 2nd month. When I was on 100 mg (my doctor didn&#039;t believe this was a side effect of the medicines (but I am CERTAIN), so I backed myself down to 75 mg and after 2 weeks of being on that reduced dosage the jaw clenching went away. SO grateful for this medicine. VERY IMPORTANT- if you have anxiety, panic, or depression. GET COUNSELING- it helps almost as much as the medicine."
