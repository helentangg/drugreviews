"I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia ten years ago.  I had a great deal of pain and a significant anxiety component.  I&#039;ve been on Cymbalta for the last five years and my fibro has been in remission for most of that time.  I take no regular pain medications. My mood is good and anxiety attacks are rare.  We lost our son in an accident 3 years ago and I felt strong enough to deliver his eulogy with resolve and confidence.  I know that Cymbalta works for me because on the occasions that I&#039;ve missed my dose two or more days in a row I feel like sobbing over things that wouldn&#039;t even get my attention when I&#039;m taking Cymbalta as prescribed.  I will gladly keep taking it for the rest of my life if it will keep me out of pain and free of anxiety."
