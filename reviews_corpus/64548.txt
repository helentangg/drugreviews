"Zoloft has saved my life! I was suffering from panic all throughout the day. It was hard to relax, focus on my work and enjoy anything. I could cry so easily. I was always opposed to medication but couldn&#039;t stand the pain of constant anxiety. I&#039;m on 50mg, it&#039;s been two months and I cannot believe how much better life has gotten. I had very little side effects and only within the first week or two. If you&#039;re suffering, do yourself a great big favor and give this medication a try!"
