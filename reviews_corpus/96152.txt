"I was prescribed Zoloft 50mg/day for anxiety/stress. I had previously taken Prozac and felt it didn&#039;t do a thing for me except decrease my sex drive tremendously. I&#039;ve only been taking the Zoloft for 4 days and was told to take it at night as it might cause drowsiness. First night, my heart raced slightly, felt jittery, couldn&#039;t sleep and had to move my legs constantly, also found my hands shaking some during the day. Second night, no heart racing, but still cant sleep and have to move legs and feel slightly jittery, but feel fatigued during the day. Third night, just restless legs and not sleepy... feel tired during the day. I&#039;m going to start taking it in the mornings and see if that will help. I need sleep. No other side effects so far."
