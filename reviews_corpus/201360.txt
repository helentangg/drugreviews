"June 2015 I was in an accident as a passenger and I developed a fear of driving, and my PTSD was triggered. I&#039;ve been diagnosed prior to the accident with GAD, Bipolar, Panic Disorder, Depression and PTSD. After a month of panic attacks my psych prescribed me Zoloft 50mg, I had terrible side effects. Mine were heightened because I was on an SSRI months before. I felt uneasy when I&#039;d take the medication so I was put on Lamictal 50mg (will go to 100mg). Panic attacks were gone by the third week, and side effects were gone by the fourth week. All I can say is if you doubt the medication is working, ride it out. I second guessed this medicine because of how bad my side effects were, I&#039;m in the fifth week of taking it and I feel amazing."
