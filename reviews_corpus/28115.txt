"I recently had some panic attacks that seemed to come from nowhere. My doctor prescribed generic lexapro. After 4 miserable days of intense anxiety I had the mother of all panic attacks in the middle of the night. That was it for me. I stopped taking it. A few weeks later I was feeling so awful that I went back to the doctor and asked him if I could start again with Ativan as a back up when the lexapro side effects were too intense. He agreed and I started on 5 Mg of lexapro. All the side effects came into play, especially anxiety. The Ativan was the difference maker. I hated taking it but it always reduced the side effects. After 9 weeks I began feeling amazing. It  was worth it. I don&#039;t rate it a 10 because of the beginning side effects."
