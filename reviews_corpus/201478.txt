"I was on Celexa for a year and it wasn&#039;t working for me. Then my doctor prescribed me Zoloft and it&#039;s my fourth day taking it and I love it. I finally have a clear head on my shoulders. And for the first time in a long time, I don&#039;t feel depressed at all. I would highly recommend this to anyone who suffers from depression."
