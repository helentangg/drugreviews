"Cymbalta is the best thing that I have ever tried and for more than just depression.  I also suffered from debilitating anxiety.  Both have all but disappeared.  Before I started taking it about 4 months ago I literally hoped I would just fade away. I wanted to die so badly it&#039;s all I thought about.  I have lost 45 pounds along with my compulsive overeating disorder and have gained more peace and happiness than I ever knew could exist for me.  It saved my life (and helped me be a much better mother, wife, daughter-everything).  I will deal with the super sweatiness and a few extra yawns during my day in order to have a life.  Viva la Cymbalta!"
