"The not-so-bad:  I&#039;m apparently one of the lucky people not to experience significant side effects.  No GI issues or nausea, although I always take with food.  The bad:  No positive effects, either.  Titrated quickly up to 20 mg, and in over a year Trintellix has done zilch to control my depression (or anxiety).  My doctor likes it for some reason and has kept trying to augment it with various meds, with little success and many bad experiences.  I&#039;ve advised him I&#039;m stopping it. Trintellix might work for mild/moderate depression, but for my MDD, it completely lacks horsepower.  It&#039;s like trying to put out a house fire with a water pistol.  I could just as well take Tic Tacs...at least they&#039;d give me fresh breath"
