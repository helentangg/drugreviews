"I have been taking Cymbalta for about 10 months now.  At first the side effects were difficult because I felt nauseous, dizzy, had brain zaps, constipation, and my dreams were crazy.  Luckily I did not quit within the first 2 weeks and the side effects mostly subsided.  Cymbalta has really helped with my anxiety and depression.  I was on 30mg then 60mg.  The first couple months were the best with no anxiety at all but slowly it started to come back. My dose has just been raised to 90mg and am also on Wellbutrin.  Not perfect and I don&#039;t want to keep raising the dose but Cymbalta has really improved my daily life and relationships with others."
