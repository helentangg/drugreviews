"I started with GAD after I gave birth to my first child. I&#039;d have panic attacks daily. I wouldn&#039;t sleep because as I dropped off and wake up gagging for air. This went on for a year without help. I then got to the point I couldn&#039;t leave the house and decided to get a doctor out. He started me on 10mg citalopram. I was on these for a good 2 years. It helped with the sleeping and panic attacks but I still left useless and seeing all the bad in life. Doc upped my dose to 20mg and ever since I started on them 2 years ago life&#039;s been brilliant. I enjoy life , I see the good in living. Don&#039;t wait to call the doctor. And don&#039;t just stick to a does that&#039;s getting you by."
