"You know, I wasn&#039;t sure what to rate this. In terms of effectiveness, definitely very much so. But in terms of the quality of life after taking this for a year and a half, I&#039;m not sure it&#039;s worth it. It acted as a number for me. I don&#039;t remember many months of my life while taking this pill. The memory loss scares me sometimes. But I like to think I was just coasting, softly through time. Maybe that&#039;s what I needed from this pill during that time of my life, however. Anyway - I don&#039;t take this anymore. I have been switched to Lithium, which has been my slow but sure savior. Overall, Effexor XR is a strong medication for strong emotions, but you lose a part of who you are along with it."
