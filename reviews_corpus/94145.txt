"I&#039;ve been taking Trintellix (that&#039;s what it&#039;s called in Canada) for 3 weeks and I can honestly say I am loving life again.  I&#039;m on 10 mg and I&#039;ve had slight nausea but if I took it with something to eat I was fine.  I was on Effexor for years and it suddenly stopped working.  I had to wean myself off of that to start Trintellix and I was at a really low point for a while but stick with this because you&#039;ll start to feel the effects by 2 weeks.  My only concern is I can&#039;t sleep so I take Imovane for that."
