"Been on sertraline for 4 months now. Initially 50mg up to 100mg after the  first two months and I feel really good. Better than I have in years, which is surprising as I think my depression only started within the last year. So perhaps I wasn&#039;t as carefree as I thought. 

My emotions are muted so no low lows but also no highs, so no feelings of joy or excitement - but I&#039;m ok with that actually I&#039;m ok with everything. I don&#039;t feel anxious, stressed, angry or frustrated. I feel confident because I don&#039;t care about consequences which is both good and bad. 
I&#039;ve spoken to strangers, which is something I never did before... And I enjoy the interaction.. 
I&#039;m really pleased with sertraline for my depression and the added bonus of reducing anxiety."
