"I&#039;ve been on Effexor 37.5mg once daily since September 2006 mainly to relieve symptoms of Irritable Bowel Syndrome &amp; Depression. Effexor has worked great for both. I tried to get myself off of Effexor a few years ago &amp; took St. John&#039;s Wort instead. I was lucky not to have any withdrawal symptoms. However, the depression returned, which I couldn&#039;t handle and returned to Effexor. I did wean myself off it and had no withdrawal symptoms. Experts say if you get off it, have to return to it, it may not work again. That didn&#039;t happen with me.  I just found that Effexor raised my blood pressure &amp; cholesterol.  I have to decide whether to stay on it and be sane &amp; preserve my kidneys, or stop it &amp; get depressed AGAIN. Conundrum."
