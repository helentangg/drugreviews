"Soooo...what a ride. Started on 10 mgs and felt ok. I was getting a stiff neck at times and my back would hurt a bit. But I kept on. Now I&#039;m on 20 mgs probably for around 3 weeks and this third week on 20mgs has been rough. It&#039;s like I sleep, but I don&#039;t feel rested. It&#039;s weird. I&#039;m hoping it goes away because I don&#039;t want to start all over again with a new drug. I&#039;ll probably stay on for a week and write down how I feel, but if that &quot;side effect&quot; doesn&#039;t go away I&#039;m done. Its helping the racing thoughts, but I can&#039;t feel tired all the time."
