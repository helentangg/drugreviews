"Ive been on lorazepam 1mg 3x daily for over 10 years and recently had not been able to get them due to switching doctors and have been having horrible side effects. I&#039;ve only been on this a short time but seems to help a little and going to give it more time. I&#039;ve read on the reviews others which gives me hope."
