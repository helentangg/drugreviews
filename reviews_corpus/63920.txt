"I was so unsure about getting on meds and really wanted to overcome a newly discovered and life crushing panic disorder I had developed. Running into people put me in panic mode, I walked around thinking everyone was staring / laughing at me.

I&#039;ve officially been on Sertraline for 2 months and my world has changed. I have my confidence back, I&#039;m dating, I&#039;m reconnecting with people and feel like my old self. This drug has saved my life. Please don&#039;t knock back the option if it&#039;s available! I&#039;m 23 years of age and thought my life was over - I have been given a reboot and I&#039;m so happy with where I am at now!

Best wishes x

Side note: minor side effects initially were diarrhea and falling asleep at 4am but that has all passed."
