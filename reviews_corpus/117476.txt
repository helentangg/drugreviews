"I started having constant headaches on the left side only. We&#039;re talking everyday, multiple times per day. I was miserable. After taking 10mg at night for a week or two my headaches stopped. I discontinued use after 3 months to see what would happen and my headaches returned 3 days later. Won&#039;t make that mistake again.  If I have had any side effects, I haven&#039;t noticed."
