"My doctor started me out on 25 mg a day for a week, then 50mg a day after that. The first 3 weeks were not good-- symptoms became somewhat worse. However I had read enough reviews to understand that I need to stick with it. After the 4th week I could tell I was not nearly as anxious and worrisome but still didn&#039;t feel 100%. My doc upped the dosage to 100mg a day and it&#039;s the perfect dose for me. Stay with this drug! It has really helped me! At first I had diarrhea for a few days, but that&#039;s gone. I yawn even when I&#039;m not tired and catch myself clenching my jaws but I will tolerate that to feel like myself again. Oh, I also had mild depression, which this drug also helped. Hope this helps someone else."
