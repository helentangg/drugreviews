"You have to keep taking this medicine forever. The withdrawl is awful after a day. However, once you find your dose everything is fine. I don&#039;t recommend this medicine because its like a marriage with a messy long divorce. Its better to stay on it once youre on it. I am on 150 mg and it works for me. Don&#039;t try and go off"
