"I have been on Pristiq for 4 months now due to panic attacks and anxiety and after the first 3 weeks I saw great change, but a few weeks after that it seemed like it had just stopped working so my doctor doubled my dosage. Now I&#039;m having nightmares. If I accidentally skip a dosage my head does this really weird thing and I just can&#039;t describe it. I am extremely irritable about every little thing or I&#039;m just really happy (up and down). I have no energy most days. I just want to stay in bed and do nothing. I&#039;m nauseated all the time. I&#039;ve actually lost about 20 pounds in 4 months bringing me down to 101 pounds. "
