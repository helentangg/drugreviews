"I was prescribed Sertraline a few days ago after having a severe panic attack (yet again). After explaining my family history to the doctor he concluded that my anxiety was probably caused by an underlying depression/ slight bipolar disorder that was never diagnosed or treated. As much as I tried to wish I was &quot;normal&quot; and denied having the same issues as many of my family members I just have to accept that I have inherited that gene. I am still nervous about being on medicines but I am hoping it helps to get my emotions under control."
