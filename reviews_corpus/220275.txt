"I have been on Amitriptyline 50 mg at night for 3 weeks and my pain has subsided a little.  I have rheumatoid arthritis, Psoriatic Arthritis, Osteoarthritis and Fibromyalgia so I have been living in chronic pain for many years.  I am also on Prednisone 9 mgs daily, which my Rheumatologist is tapering me off of slowly. I also am on Hydrocodone 10 mgs, 2 tablets 4 times daily. My doctor just increased the Amitriptyline to 100 mgs at night.  I will share my experience with this dose in another 3 weeks or so."
