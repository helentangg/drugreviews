"I have been on the med (20mg) for about 3 week for depression. Luckily no side effects and already feel loads better . Don&#039;t get me wrong, I have had the odd really low day but don&#039;t we all! But positives feel I can cope lots better plus not eating for the sake of eating . Still got to help myself to get motivated. Wished I was honest with myself years ago and went on medication."
