"I did not notice a change while taking this med. I still took it for 2 years even though it was not effective. The reason I continued this med was because everything me and my Dr tried to get me off the med, it did not work. Finally after 2 years. I was able to stop taking it by starting prozac the next day of my last dose of cymbalta. I took the prozac for 10 days with no side effects and then I stopped the prozac. I am finally free of that prison."
