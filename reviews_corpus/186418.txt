"I suffer from depression and panic disorder. I take Pristiq with Ativan. I&#039;ve been taking Pristiq for 5 months.  Just within the last 2 weeks I was told to up it to 100mg because the 50mg just was not taking away my depression.  I have noticed a lot more of an effect from the 100mg.  I think you just need to get it into you system for a couple of months, until you have no side effects and if it isn&#039;t taking away the depression then start upping it gradually. What I did was I took 1 pill in the morning, and 1 at night.  Now I am finally taking 2 in the morning, and so far so good.  The depression is lifting. I&#039;ve also lost 30 lbs since Pristiq. PS. never had any noticeable side effects. Just one complaint: CONSTIPATION."
