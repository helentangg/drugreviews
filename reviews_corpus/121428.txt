"After a very dark time in my life I dropped my male pride and sought help from my physician and was diagnosed with MDD and GAD. I was prescribed Effexor XR 75mg and being my first experience with anti depressants was very leery. For about two weeks the side effects were more than noticeable, sweating, dizziness, constipation, nausea brain zaps ect. 
About the same time (2 weeks) the relief set in the side effects began to lift.
 Everyone is different but Effexor has been a life saver and to say my life has turned around would be a huge understatement. From despair to feeling &quot;normal&quot; and enjoying life maybe for the first time ever. 
For me the only lasting side effect seems to be dry mouth after nearly a year. Small price to pay."
