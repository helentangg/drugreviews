"Started taking nortriptyline for migraine prevention after 10 years of going to 6 different neurologists and taking countless medications. The first 3 weeks were great because I had gone from 2-3 days a week of migraines to not a single episode. It was very hard to deal with the daytime fatigue and this was only on a 25 mg dose, but two cups of coffee took care of that. I stopped taking it suddenly after 1.5 months due to a change in mood/angry/depressed feelings which I&#039;ve never experienced, and sure enough I was in bed for 3 days with a migraine. So, I&#039;m back on the medicine, have been almost migraine free for 3 months, the fatigue has gone away, and as long as I remember to read my &quot;positive thoughts/positive things in my life&quot; when I feel a little depressed (this medicine or at least 25mg a day hasn&#039;t helped depression) I&#039;m fine. I&#039;m 31 yrs old, healthy and now finally can live my life not worrying about migraines! Thank you to my neurologist for finally finding an answer to my pain and thank you nortriptyline."
