"I&#039;m 16, and over the course of a few months I started becoming more and more depressed and anxious, after trying a few other medications along with none at all (only therapy), I started taking Zoloft as it has helped others in my family. The first 10 days (started at 25mg) were horrible, suicidal thoughts, no appetite, headaches and terrible anxiety but once I hit 2 weeks I felt so much better. I&#039;m now 6 weeks in and on 75mg, I feel amazing, still get headaches but I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s related, I feel almost 100% myself, I&#039;ll give it a few more weeks and see if I need to maybe get to 100mg but honestly this medication saved my life."
