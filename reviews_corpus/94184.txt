"I started on 10 mg of brintellix and took it at night. I did not have any side effects in the first two days, except that I felt a little bit more depressed at night on day two.  I wasn&#039;t sure if it was due to the medication or not. On the third day, I had a mental breakdown. I had one negative thought after another and my mind was racing. I started crying and got suicidal. I was so worried for my safety so I was thinking about going to the ER, but I stuck it out and eventually the suicidal thoughts disappeared. After that incident, I got off of brintellix. It was the worst experience I&#039;ve had from a medication."
