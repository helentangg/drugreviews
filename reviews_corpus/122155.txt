"I returned to work, after having my second child, at the end of April.  By the begining of June everything was falling apart.  The job I had worked so hard to attain, my relationship, my friendships...nothing seemed to be going well, my two beautiful boys were the only thing keeping me remotely together.  I was asked to take a leave from work.  I started with Zoloft - terrible I clenched my teeth all day long!  Moved to Cymbalta - all I wanted to do was sleep, with two very active boys naps are just not an option.  I started taking Effexor XR two weeks ago now.  Love IT!!  The only side effect I&#039;m noticing is short term memory loss, but hey my sex drive finally came back!!!  YEAH!  That alone does help alot with my depression."
