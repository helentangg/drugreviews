"About 3-4 months of using this medicine I started to notice the way it effected my thinking. Things would come up in my life that would&#039;ve normally triggered my depression. However when these things happened, I felt a fake sense of relief. I felt like I wanted to be upset about these things that were happening, but my brain wouldn&#039;t let me. It felt unfamiliar and unlike myself. It was as though I could feel a whole layer of feelings that I was unable to express. My doctor switched me over to Zoloft and I&#039;m noticing better results."
