"When I first started this medication I had a lot of the dreaded side effects, GI issues, nausea, headache, heartburn, and some sleep issues.  I&#039;m now on my third week of taking the medication and it has changed my whole life.  I had such a negative outlook on everything I thought I hated my job and that my friends were crappy I just didn&#039;t enjoy anything anymore and since taking this medicine its literally like a cloud has lifted.  It even changed the way I feel.  I feel so calm and relaxed and it made me realize how tense I was all the time before.  The side effects have all gone except an occasional headache and I&#039;m still having some sleep issues but its getting better.  Totally worth feeling as good as I do now.  I hope it keeps working!"
