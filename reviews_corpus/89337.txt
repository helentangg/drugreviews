"I suffer from PTSD and severe chronic depression. I have been on multiple medications, taking 10-12 pills a day. My doctor recommending celexa for depression as well as my anxiety, and guess what. I am now on 4 pills a day celexa for depression, klonopin for my anxiety attacks, ambien to help me sleep, and prazosin to keep my nightmares at bay. Celexa works for me amazingly, it has calmed me down some and I used to just burst out in tears at the simplest things because they reminded me of my past. Not anymore. Although I have it a 9 and not a 10 because the first couple weeks are rough. I was very VERY lethargic and sleepy and I was still having mood swings which got a little worse. I stuck with it and it changed me."
