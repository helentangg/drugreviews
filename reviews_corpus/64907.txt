"I have been on Zoloft for a bit now and am on a 50mg dose. I find it has made a world of difference. I was taking it after dinner and had real bad insomnia and buzzing etc. So I told my doctor and we changed the schedule so I started taking it in the morning and I sleep great at night.
Zoloft has helped with my depression and anxiety. I haven&#039;t felt this great since I can&#039;t even remember when.
If your having bad side effects like the insomnia talk to your doctor and change the times you take your meds."
