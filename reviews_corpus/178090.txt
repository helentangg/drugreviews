"I developed Occipital Neuralgia, left side, some years ago.  After several treatments with pain specialists and no results, I tried Cymbalta.  In 7 weeks I was pain free. This continued for a couple of years until I broke my leg and had to spend 3 months in a nursing home.  At the nursing home, the physician switched me to Wellbutrin [less expensive] which was OK but not as good as Cymbalta.  After about two years on Bupropion my left side is still OK but it has now developed on my right side.  Since I am still taking Bupropion, it obviously isn&#039;t working.  I&#039;m going to see my physician for Cymbalta."
