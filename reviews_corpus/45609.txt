"I was on Lexapro which made me suicidal and started Prozac 20 mg. It was easy to wean off the Lexapro. After taking my pill in the morning I immediately felt severe drowsiness, heavy eyelids and tiredness. I started during my holiday and took a nap every afternoon. But once back to work the tiredness was unbearable. Especially in the afternoon, I could hardly keep my eyes open and have never drank so much Espresso and energy drinks. The Espressos did not even bring me to shaking whatsoever nor relieved my drowsiness. After 2 weeks and 2 days I quit but side effects lasted for at least a week. I must say it lifted my depression."
