"I&#039;ve been suffering from major depression &amp; anxiety for the past few years until I finally decided I&#039;ve had enough! Initially I was prescribed Cipralex which helped with my anxiety but I gained way too much weight &amp; couldn&#039;t stop eating so after approx 6 months I went off it which wasn&#039;t hard at all, no withdrawal symptoms. 
I was then put on Wellbutrin 150mg then after approx 1 month up to 300mg. I felt great positive energy   lost a lot of the weight I gained. After approx 1 year I felt that this med was totally ineffective &amp; I wasn&#039;t feeling anything. 
My doc then prescribed Cymbalta which appeared to work well for approx 1 month then after the next 2 months I didn&#039;t feel anything.
Now I&#039;m on Pristiq for just over 5 weeks, I feel good."
