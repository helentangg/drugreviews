"I have had panic attacks and anxiety and stress for over 10 years now. They tried everything until one Doctor put me on Xanax and it was such a relief for a while. Now I am up to 2mgs 3 times a day and my newest doctor put me on Celexa 6 months ago. There was some nausea at first like he said and sleepiness but it quit after a week or two and it so mellowed me out more. The attacks are less frequent and not near as bad. So for me a God send! I know everyone is different but I have not had one bad thought and can actually go out and shop and do things without worrying about an attack! The nausea was worth working through. Thank you Celexa! It sure helped me! "
