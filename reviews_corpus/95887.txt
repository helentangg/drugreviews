"I highly recommend trying this medicine.  I&#039;ve been suffering with extreme anxiety/ocd for years.  Tried lexapro(bad weight gain &amp; didnt feel any different), elavil(did the same as lexapro) and pristiq(made me feel worse).  Finally I went to a psychiatrist &amp; he immediately put me on zoloft 25 mg (sertraline) &amp; small dose of xanax (alprazolam).  We planned out to slowly iincrease up to 200 mg within a few months. Eventually made it to the max dose 6 months later, along with CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy).  I&rsquo;ve had a few side effects (memory loss, stomach problems) but that&#039;s it.  I can finally go throughout my days &amp; function.  Some days are just crap though, which happens.  Changed my life &amp; am so thankful."
