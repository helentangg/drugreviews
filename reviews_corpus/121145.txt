"My PCP put me on 37.5 venlaflaxine for hot flashes and anxiety.   She did not want to give me the estrogen patch, which is what I hoped for, because she was concerned about my anxiety.  The drug worked in 2 days on the hot flashes, eliminating them completely.   Also, my appetite dropped and I lost 20 pounds in the five weeks I was on it.   My anxiety improved a bit, but unfortunately, the drug caused me to feel jittery and disassociated from my body.  I decided to dump the drug and get the patch from my OB-gyn--best thing I ever did.  I feel AMAZING and NORMAL and haven&#039;t gained an ounce back three weeks later.  I do not have my uterus anymore, so my risk is low.  So glad I listened to my body!!!"
