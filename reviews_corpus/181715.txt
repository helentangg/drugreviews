"I&#039;m going to make this short and simple
Pros: felt better within the month of taking it
slowed my bulimia way down.
CONS: had to up the dosage a month ago. So fare so good. I yawned the first 2 weeks straight all day long but its over now.
ive been taking it for 2 months now and i love it! im 24 years old and have had my deppression and bulimia for 13 years and i have never felt this good.
also im on 1mg of klonopin(clonazapam) at night. i like that too.
hope this helps"
