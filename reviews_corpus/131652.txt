"MY EXPERIENCE with Effexor XR vs Prozac

1) EXR eliminates ALL PANIC ATTACKS
2) Prozac eliminates ALL OBSESSIVE THINKING
3) Prozac made me sleep like a fat cat even tho I RARELY ate, and I gained a ton of weight when I was only 106 lbs to start.
4) EXR did not cause me weight gain (or loss) however it made me very irritable and I caught myself clenching my jaw all day, however had a lot more energy than Prozac.
5) BOTH meds I used over 12 weeks to make a fair comparison.

6) I saw a bio-identical hormones therapist to see what&#039;s going on.  No clear cut answers.  So here is my thought.  You&#039;re a normal person being a normal life with a normal energy level. You take Prozac and Wham! You&#039;re  sleeping 10 hours a day............................."
