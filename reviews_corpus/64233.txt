"Been on Zoloft 50 mg for 3 weeks and I&#039;m starting to feel like myself again. I have MDD, ADD, anxiety, panic attacks and insomnia but since taking this medication I am sleeping again and waking up without my alarm which has never happened.  I was a little sick for the first few days however it passed.  My panic attacks are almost gone.  My doctor agreed to increase my dosage to 100 mg to see if I can get a little better I&#039;m almost where I want to be but my negative emotions have subsided tremendously.  I know this road is hard for all of us but don&#039;t give up.  Remember the chemical make up in your brain changes overtime, so when something stops working seek help.  Best regards!"
