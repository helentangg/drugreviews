"I use to read these reviews all the time while trying to figure out a med that would work for me. I promised myself I would write a review if I ever found one that was working for me. I have been diagnosed with treatment resistant clinical depression, anxiety and panic disorder. I have been hospitalized twice in the past two years. It has made my life a living hell. After 15 ECT treatments and 150mg of amitriptyline I am finally doing much better. My point to writing this is please don&#039;t ever give up!"
