"After a tragic and dark episode in my late 20&#039;s where I seemed to have reached rock bottom, some random doctor put me on effexor, minimal dose. Eleven years later I have never been able to get off the damn thing. And I lost count on how many times I&#039;ve tried. This stuff is seriously addictive and is one of the worst in its kind. Make absolutely sure you really know what you get yourself into with this drug. Even just missing a day makes me sick, two and I&#039;m sick as hell. I just finally started the long and slow process of tampering down 10% a month by removing little beads. It&#039;s gonna take ten months but I am determined and hoping it works out smoothly ... Nothing this addictive can be good. Beware."
