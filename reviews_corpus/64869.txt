"Started taking 50mg sertealine for depression and anxiety, I started getting nausea after the first day, after a week it settled and after 2 weeks I felt a slight change in my mood but it seemed to be more effective for my anxiety. After 3 weeks I started getting some terrible side effects such as a bad stomach and diareha also long painful headaches. Anyway a month down the line I feel a lot better I can honestly say the medication is working although it has it&#039;s ups and downs try to stick with it, I would recommend seeing your Doctor to get the medication changed or the dosage changed if it has no effect because it&#039;s what I did. My quality of life has become so much better. I try to ignore the occasional side effects! Stick with it"
