"I&#039;m a 20 year old female. I was prescribed Prozac 6 months ago. For the first few weeks I felt great, everything seemed better. After 1 month I became even more depressed, my period was very heavy and lasted weeks at a time. I had disturbing nightmares everything, developed restless legs syndrome, and started grinding my teeth. I was tired constantly and ended up in hospital due to suicidal thoughts. I am now on citalopram and things have never been better."
