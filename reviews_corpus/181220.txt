"Admittedly, when I started Prozac and up until I stopped taking it, I was not very honest with my therapist on my emotional state, so I never changed medication despite it&#039;s lack of effect on me. I was taking it to help with my depression and anxiety, and it didn&#039;t help with either. It didn&#039;t have any negative effects on me, but it didn&#039;t have any positive effects either. I had started at 10 mg, went up to 20 mg, and finally 40 mg. For each one, it seemed to help at first but wouldn&#039;t after around two weeks. Although it wasn&#039;t right for me, I know that it&#039;s been quite helpful to friends of mine and it wouldn&#039;t hurt to try it out yourself."
