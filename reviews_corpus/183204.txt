"I&#039;ve been taking 120mg of Cymbalta for 6 months now &amp; have found the benefits to be: decreased anxiety; increased social confidence; and 10kg (22.2 pounds) weight loss!! The negatives have been: irregular insomnia; slightly manic personality when really comfortable in my social surroundings; dry mouth; mild occasional nausea &amp; that&#039;s about it. I&#039;m under the watchful eye of a great Psychiatrist &amp; think Cymbalta is much better than Prozac &amp; Zoloft which I&#039;ve been on for 5 years prior (at alternate times). Also, I strongly recommend reducing your alcohol intake - Cymbalta increases side effects &amp; makes you feel embarrassingly drunk &amp; tired much earlier than others. Good luck."
