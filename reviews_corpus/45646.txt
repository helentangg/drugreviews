"I have suffered everything from obsessive compulsive disorder to bulimia to panic disorder to depression. Prozac (fluoxetine) has been my miracle. I have been on and off it since I was very young but have stayed on it regularly for many years now. It helped me back to myself and gives me the motivation I need. It saved my life."
