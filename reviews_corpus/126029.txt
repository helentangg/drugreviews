"I&#039;ve been on so many anti depressants. I can&#039;t even tell you how many I&#039;ve tried and none of them had any effect or very little. My doctor started me out on sample pack of Viibryd and gave me a few packs of the 40mg to last me until she gets back from out of the country. I&#039;ve been on it for a month now and it&#039;s been amazing. I have schizoaffective disorder with major depression, panic disorder and post traumatic stress disorder. Viibyrd is amazing. I feel so much better already. I never got any of the side effects other people experienced. It&#039;s been nothing but pleasant for me. My mood, energy, everything has gotten so much higher than it has been in years. I&#039;m so excited about my future now. I have so many dreams that I feel like I can now accomplish and I&#039;m very optimistic now."
