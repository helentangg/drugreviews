"The first week Paxil was great I felt better no more anxiety and I felt happy and not stressed. But now going on the 3rd week I feel so sleepy I have no interest in doing anything and I&#039;m jittery at the same time. I&#039;ve never been not interested in doing house cleaning or going outside but now I don&#039;t want to do anything but sleep."
