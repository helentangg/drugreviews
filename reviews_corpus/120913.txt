"This drug has changed my life for the better I have been on and off anxiety drugs for 30 years would come off them for a few years and the anxiety and panic would always return. After 2 years on citalopram came off went 2 years being off them then anxiety returned went sertraline what a nightmare after 2 months stopped because of very bad side effects after 4 weeks went back on for 3 months suffered really bad again phoned Docs changed me to venlafaxine 75 mg slow release sat and looked at them for a month terrified.  Eventually phoned Docsb who put me straight.  I took them and what a difference I am alive again and no problems 10 out of 10 saved my life and life is good again never felt so good. After 30 years this is the one for me. Thx. Do not be afraid of this"
