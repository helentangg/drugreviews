"3 years of Chronic Pain Syndrome brought on by total knee replacement that doesn&#039;t work now.  Still in severe pain have tried many medications for the nerve pain in knee, hip, back, leg.  The Amitriptyline is the only medication that has helped me sleep at night.  BUT....I had four migraines in one week while using the medication and it makes food, water, soda all taste bitter bad.  Don&#039;t know what to do as it works but can&#039;t live with that many migraines.  Usually one 1 migraine a month if that.  So not taking it now.  Any suggestions?"
