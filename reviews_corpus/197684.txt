"I&#039;ve been on Pristiq for 10 days now. It has really helped me -NO SIDE EFFECTS. I eat when taking it, it helps. I&#039;m also on Suboxone for pain. I&#039;ve noticed that I smoke more now, which might be from financial problems. I get constipation bit more but minimal problem. I have to take it in the morning like many people say or it keeps me up. Weird how different it affects people - some people say it helps them sleep. Goodluck folks."
