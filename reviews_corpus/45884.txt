"I take 40mg once a day, and it helps me cope with going out and having to deal with people. Before I would freak out and couldn&#039;t go places or be in crowded areas. It takes the edge off and I don&#039;t feel like I&#039;m going to die. I also take Wellbutrin SR 200mg a day, and now I&#039;m just happy and feel like myself."
