"I am a 42 yr old mother. I have been depressed all of my life. Never been happy more than a few weeks at a time. I have tired a few different mess but no real change. I would also self medicate with alcohol. At least once a week I would get to drunk I would black out. As you probably figured that caused a lot of problems in itself. I started taken Brentellix 6 moths ago and I have NEVER been so happy in my entire life! I love it! It really changed my life for the better. No more drinking! At all. I&#039;m so happy and my family has also seen the change are are more happy."
