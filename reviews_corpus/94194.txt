"I had given up that there was any drug that could lift me out of the recurring cycles of clinical depression. I had tried dozens of medications over the years, some worked for a time but I came to the point that my depression was at least I thought untreatable. This last bout had me down in bed for nearly 2 months. I was &quot;blessed&quot; to stumble upon Brintellix after my wife had recommended it after seeing it  transform one of her patients. The key is it takes a very long time to work and you must be patient. I am now almost 6 weeks in and the depression has completely lifted and feeling better every day. Yes, there are side effects.. headaches, insomnia and confusion but they go away. This drug saved my life!  Give it 6-8 week at minimum!"
