"I had panic attacks most of my adult life, was afraid of taking pills. I was taking Ativan for my condition, in order for my doctor to get me off the Ativan I was prescribe Zoloft,  I took this medication for about six months along with a half Ativan. I started feeling normal in about 3 weeks, after about six months I stopped taking both of them and felt great for a whole year until something happened to cause me much anxiety again.  I am back on the Ativan for the last 5 months, just filled the prescription for Zoloft again, hoping it does what is did before. Don&#039;t like taking meds but it worked a miracle for me."
