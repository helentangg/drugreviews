"Having felt sick for the better part of the last year, many side effects of pain in my neck due to 3 bulging discs,  I was recently hospitalized with heart palpitations but nothing seems to be wrong with my heart. My doctor thought I may be having depression due to all my physical pain. She started me on 25 mg of zoloft two weeks ago and increased it to 50 mg today.  I&#039;m feeling a positive change already. Not dwelling on my feelings of pain and sickness.  I will continue zoloft as the side effects are minimal compared to the benefits"
