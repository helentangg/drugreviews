"I want  to say that before Celexa i was very depressed and my anxiety level was very high. I&#039;t been on 20mg of Celex, for the past 2 weeks now and i can tell you, its worked wonderfully. I don&#039;t feel depressed my anxiety is much better than i have felt in a long time  I haven&#039;t even had a crying spells like i used to for the past two weeks now. I now actually do what i plan to do without changing my mind like i normally do.  I recommend this med it has worked for me. I have more energetic and happy  and I&#039;t might not work for you but  I&#039;ts worth trying!"
