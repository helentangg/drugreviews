"Started taking this medication about a month ago and I must say that it really works. Initially, I started to take 100 mg every morning and it made me extremely nauseous, but the nausea subsided after about two weeks. I get the occasional dry mouth, etc. but that is a small price to pay to not have dysthemia. The only complaint that I have with this medicine is that it produces some heavy sexual side effects, loss of libido, delayed ejaculation. I am currently on 150 mg per day. My doctor does not think that 50 mg is a &#039;therapeutic&#039; dose and has only seen positive results in doses above 100 mg&#039;s. I do not want to reduce the dose because I have finally found something that actually works."
