"Have taken Paxil 10mg/daily for the last 9 yrs off and on. I have very few side effects. I do get the dry mouth and hot flashes the first month of starting and hot flashes after missing a couple of doses. The side effects are different for everyone, I actually lose weight on Paxil because without it I am a nervous eater. Paxil does help with my concentration and memory. I tend to worry about all the &quot;what-if&#039;s?&quot; which clogs up my mind. Paxil helps me put things in prospective, I don&#039;t sweat all the small while I take it. Works well for me."
