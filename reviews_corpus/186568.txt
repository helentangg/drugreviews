"I took Pristiq for six days due to OCD/anxiety. While I think that this drug did help with my symptoms it made by blood pressure go through the roof. My blood pressure has always been normal (no higher than 120/80). I think that this is a side effect that needs to be mentioned more frequently. The side effects are too much! (I also had sweating, and problems sleeping even when I took it at night)."
