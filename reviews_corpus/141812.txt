"My depression and anxiety nearly killed me and after being in denial I decited to seek help. Lexapro literaly saved my life. I was on a treatment for 6 months and i felt fine after that but unfortunately I had a relaps a year later and I&#039;m back on it again. Unfortunately mental disorders run in my family so this is more genetic than anything in my case. But this medication helps me run my life and feel normal."
