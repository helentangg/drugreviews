"I have been on Silenor since shortly after it hit the market....2011.  It has been life changing.  I can nap now, and some nights I can even sleep without it, which never happened on any other sleep meds.  I will say it took about 4 weeks when I initially started it for it to really do the job-those were a rough for weeks.  I also have very good commercial insurance that only requires a $5.00 co pay for a 3 month supply;  my old plan used to require $100 for a 39 day supply.  Since it is not cost prohibitive, it works well."
