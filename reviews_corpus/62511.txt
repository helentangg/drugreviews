"I was prescribed Celexa and Ativan for severe anxiety. I was told to take Celexa 20mg in the morning as soon as I got up, and take Ativan 3x a day. So far so good if you want to ZERO emotions. I work in a high stress job and and can&#039;t be a zombie all day so I quit taking the Ativan. Seems as though the Celexa is doing its job pretty well. I&#039;m able to function at work, just a bit lethargic. tomorrow will be 1 week, and the Dr said it will take up to a month to receive the full benefits, Fingers crosses!"
