"I live in Scotland and have suffered clinical depression and anxiety for years I was not on any meds between 2009 to 20015 but finally I cracked in September 2015 and lost about 2 stone in weight and I was chain smoking after having quit years before I&#039;m also asthmatic so that is never a good idea. Anyway I went to g.p and he put me on citalopram now months later I feel they are helping I&#039;m on 40 mg split into morning and evenings."
