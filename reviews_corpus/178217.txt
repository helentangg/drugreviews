"I have GAD with mild depression which caused a lot of tension in my shoulders and confused, muddled thinking with poor memory. I tend to be really irritable and short tempered with mood swings. I&#039;ve so far taken Cymbalta for about 4-5 months. My mood swings, irritability and temper have improved. I am able to think much more clearly and remember better. The bad, my social anxiety hasn&#039;t improved much and I gained about 5 pounds. Otherwise no side effects. It doesn&#039;t make me sleepy, spacey, numb, nor does it diminish my libido. It isn&#039;t a wonder drug but it&#039;s nice to have fewer side effects."
