"I have been on Zoloft for about 4 years now (previously on Paxil?). I have suffered from anxiety and panic as long as I can remember. I started with 50mg Zoloft once a day and that worked well. I had my dosage upped about 12 months later due to stress (major holiday, moving states etc). This worked great!! About 6 months ago I started taking 1 tablet every 2 days as per doctors directions to begin the weaning off process. This worked well for quite a while, but 10 days ago I went out and drank way more than I ever do. The next day I was hungover and the anxiety returned. I had not experienced it like this for over 4 years! I began taking the 100mg daily again and I&#039;m beginning to feel better.For new users, don&#039;t give up! It really does help"
