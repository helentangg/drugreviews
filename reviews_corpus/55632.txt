"I am a female senior and started taking this drug about 8 months ago, so far it works well for the depression at 150mg.   I missed taking the drug for 2 days and as a result I had terrible symptoms when I went to bed, my muscles felt like they were tensed and shaking, could not go to sleep but must have at some point and had terrible dreams, now I feel quite ill, stomach upset, gut upset,  sweating, horrible.  Had to take some pepto bismol tabs to try to settle my stomach.  Took my pill at lunch today, waiting to see if I start to feel better.  Surely there must be a drug that can do the same job without the necessity to take it with food and won&#039;t send you body into a tizzy if you miss a dose or 2."
