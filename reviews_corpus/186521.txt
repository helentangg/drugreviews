"I have been on Pristiq for 8 months, 50mg. Also on Wellbutrin 400 mg for 2 months. Pristiq has been wonderful. The Wellbutrin added to it just made it that much better. In the beginning I didn&#039;t have any side effects. Now I&#039;m having trouble with insomnia and jaw/neck clenching. I am going to start taking the Pristiq in the mornings as a lot of people have mentioned its better. I&#039;m going to see if that makes a difference in the insomnia. If not I&#039;m going back to the Doctor and get something to help me sleep. Other then that Pristiq has been great. No depression. No mood swings. No anxiety. My boyfriend has noticed these changes too. Good luck to everyone"
