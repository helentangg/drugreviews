"I was diagnosed with major depression at 42. I also suffered from crippling anxiety and chronic insomnia. I was prescribed Doxepin after trying other antidepressants  which had shocking side effects and made my symptoms worse. Doxepin pulled me out of the abyss and gave me my life back. It literally saved my life and I thank god every day for this amazing drug. I have been taking it for 23 years and it have had no side effects from prolonged use of this medication."
