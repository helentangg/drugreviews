"I was at the end of my rope...I tried everything to control my anxiety...other medications  (zyban)...nutrition choices...self medicating  (alcohol-which only made it worse). Venlafaxine is a God&#039;s send for me...it has given me my quality of life back. No more waking up scared to face the day...no more fear of driving or feeling of fainting in a social situation. I can&#039;t praise this medication enough."
