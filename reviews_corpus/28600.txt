"Unfortunately after losing insurance coverage I had to switch from Lexapro to Citalopram for affordability.  I sure hope Lexapro has a generic form soon because it helped a little better than what I am currently taking.  I have a couple of friends who have been on Lexapro, and versus other medications it has yielded the best results."
