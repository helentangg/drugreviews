"I took 5 mg of it at night because it made me drowsy. The first two days, I didn&#039;t have much symptoms besides the drowsiness. But on the third day, I had  a mental meltdown. I had a lot of bad, racing thoughts. I got suicidal and I almost admitted myself to the hospital. Luckily I stuck it out and  I was ok the next day. I stopped taking the medication after that experience."
