"I have had depression for years with obsessive compulsive disorder. I have been been on everything from Xanax, Effexor, Depakote, Prozac, Zoloft, etc. I started Viibryd 4 days ago along with ADHD medicines and anxiety meds and I have to say my brain is not running 90 to nothing I am not depressed and feel good. Yes my GI system has been upset and last two nights I have not slept well and I have had a mild headache but because everything is manageable and I mental feel better I am willing to tough it out and hopefully it will stop. Doctor gave me a free starter kit starting with 10mgs for 7 days then 20mgs for 7 days and 40mgs for 7 days so hopefully it will keep going this good or better."
