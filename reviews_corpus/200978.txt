"I was prescribed this a couple of months ago for severe anxiety and postpartum depression after an ectopic pregnancy. I felt euphoric for the first few days, and was literally awake for over 48 hours straight. But after the initial side effects wore off I was so thankful for this meditation. I was always against antidepressants and believed I could just &#039;get over it&#039; with my mind...but after losing the baby my anxiety was through the roof and I couldn&#039;t function like a normal person. I&#039;d come home from work and hide in my room away from my family, I avoided leaving the house unless I absolutely had to, I&#039;d spend all day exhausting myself. I now feel more like myself than I have in years."
