"The drug works very good for depression and anxiety. It also completely eliminates my headaches. I was a chronic headache sufferer for years and ever since I started taking Prozac I almost never have a headache. I think this drug should be studied more as a medication to treat chronic headaches as it increases Serotonin in the brain and Serotonin is a major factor in headache issues."
