"After dealing with PPD for over a year, I began taking Effexor XR about 3 years ago. I&#039;m sorry that I waited so long! I had been dealing with panic attacks, inability to sleep restfully, and various other issues during my daughter&#039;s first year. After taking Effexor XR (initially I was tired and feeling sort of sluggish) for about 2 months, I felt 150% better! I was moving around a lot more, wanted to be out and about, playing with my daughter more. It was a miracle, for me. It also took my mind off of dealing with depression, and focusing on being able to function. Actually being able to feel BETTER, and to deal with things that had been seriously affecting my overall happiness all along. It gave me strength to make life changes."
