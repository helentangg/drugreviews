"On and Off depression and severe anxiety for 40 years.  Tried many medications, most with very uncomfortable side-effects.  Changed to Celexa over 8 years ago with remarkable results and absolutely no discernible side-effects.  Doctor had changed medicine to something new about 3 years ago and my wife made me go back to Celexa after only a few months.  Under extreme stress anxiety does return, but not nearly as severe.   I am now 62 years old."
