"Hi, I&#039;m trying to find a new medication to try for my GAD because lexapro isn&#039;t working anymore. I&#039;ve been on that for 5-6 years now. Went from 5mg to 20 mg. Please share some experiences with me. Bad/ good. I despratly need to know I do not trusty doctor he is a pill pusher and I want to know what I&#039;m getting into before I start anything and I&#039;m thinking Zoloft sounds good."
