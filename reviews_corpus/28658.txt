"Been on and off anti depressants for 10 years (still can&#039;t believe it). Tried Paxil and currently take 10 mg of Lexapro.  Still do not feel well.  I find running helps me more than anything but I fear the day the running is too much. I&#039;m 40 and in otherwise good health, but I feel pretty lousy almost every single day.  I am happy to read about people doing well on medication, but all I get from it is dizziness/lightheaded.  Still optimistic about one day looking back at this nightmare in disbelief.  Until then."
