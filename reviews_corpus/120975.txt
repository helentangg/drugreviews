"Venlafaxine ER gives me a bigger bucket to hold my anxiety and depression so I don&#039;t launch into panic attacks or deep depressive episodes quite as quickly. Because it does not take away any feelings or emotions, it still allows my mind to learn to deal with my stressors and triggers. And, it does not take my mind from me at all, which is eminently important to me because I am a detail-oriented thinker by nature."
