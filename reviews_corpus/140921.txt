"I have been in a really bad funk for as long as I can remember and have been through a good amount. I won&#039;t go into details because its not relevant. Also felt like my brain was foggy and mind constantly racing. I have social anxiety as well. I am on day two of lexapro and I think it&#039;s working already. I feel warm inside, peaceful and am interacting with people so easily. It&#039;s strange. I can&#039;t explain it bit I feel peaceful, happy and not anxious. I haven&#039;t felt this way in a long time. I get drowsy and my eyes get heavy randomly through out the day. I&#039;ve also started smiling randomly. I know this is sort of vague, I wanted to be straight to the point. I really hope this is it and I have found the right medicine and hope this lasts!"
