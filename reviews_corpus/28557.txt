"So today is my first day taking Lexapro, my psychiatrist instructed me to take half of a 10mg daily.  I took the dose today at 4 pm and already I feel different.  I bursted into laughter and caught myself laughing at the silliest thing, but I feel so much better.  I felt light-headed for the first 15 minutes, now I feel okay. I just hope this medicine helps me like it has helped others. I can&#039;t say I recommend it yet because its my first day. However I do see a very slight difference in myself. I rated a 7 because anything that makes me laugh instantly more than likely is a pretty good medicine."
