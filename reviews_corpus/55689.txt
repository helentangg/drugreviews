"Effexor saved my life!!!! I was so hesitant at first to try this drug because to me it seemed so powerful compared to Zoloft and Celexa which I&#039;ve been on in the past. I was also nervous bc of the reviews I read with ppl talking about all the horrible side effects. I&#039;m here to tell you DONT BELEIVE EVERYTHING YOU READ. Effexor is absolutely amazing!!! I had no side effects at all. If I had to say I had any it would be cold sweats for maybe a day but that&#039;s it. I take 150mg ER a day and I am back to my old self if not better. My advice is that everyone&#039;s body reacts differently to medication and not everyone experiences the same things. This drug is amazing and has helped my depression in every way...."
