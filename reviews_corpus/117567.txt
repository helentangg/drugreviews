"Never really had headaches until after brain surgery for a cavernous malformation.  After the surgery was okay for about a month and then had headaches everyday.  I was just learning how to live with them but somedays I just needed to stay in bed.  Had a neurologist try one med that knocked me out and switched to a new neurologist that put me on this med.  After one week I was a new person.  Have been on it for several months with maybe one headache and I think that trigger was lack of food.  I am sold on this medication it has been life changing.  I did notice there were lots of side effects and was nervous at first but the benefits totally out weigh the dry mouth I get.  Trying Biotine mouth was for that.  Sleeping well too"
