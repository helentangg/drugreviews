"This medicine has really helped me to sleep. My pain has gone down including migraines. I am still very stiff in the morning and sometimes I have weak legs. Only two side affects I&#039;ve noticed, dry mouth and sleepy in the morning if I take the meds too late. But still pretty happy with the meds."
