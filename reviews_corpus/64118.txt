"I have been taking sertraline for many years.  It was prescribed to relieve my levels of anxiety.  Considerably, it helped, however due to the fact that I have been taking for so many years, my dr decided to increase the dosage to 200mg and presently he prescribed oxcarbazepine 150mg.   Although sertraline helps me to control my anxiety, an additional increment was needed.  While I don&#039;t take sertraline can feel the side effects such as dizziness and nausea.  It is a good psychotropic medication, however after a while it seems that mg has to be increased.  Hoping this would help me to decrease my anxiety and moderate depression."
