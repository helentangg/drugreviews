"I have neuropathy in my feet and slightly in my hands. Amitryptiline made my pain livable - still bad, but I could function. When I began taking Cymbalta along with the amitryptline, almost immediately the pain subsided and practically disappeared!  I no long take the Amitryptiline and Cymbalta keeps the pain to a low ebb, allowing me to sleep and join in activities I had long given up.  Doesn&#039;t do a thing for my &quot;attitude&quot;, but being relatively pain free does make me happy."
