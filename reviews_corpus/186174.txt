"I rated Pristiq a 9 for the simple fact that although it was really helped me get out of depression, I have been having crazy vivid dreams.  The dreams are not pleasant, or bad, just weird.  I have flashbacks about them all through the day, and I can recall almost every little detail.  Some might argue that this is not a bad side effect, however, because of this, I&#039;ve been having poor sleep.

All this said, it wouldn&#039;t be a reason for me to get off the medication.  It has really given me back my life!"
