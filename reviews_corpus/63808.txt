"After experiencing probably the darkest time of my life, and sitting through therapy sessions that I felt were getting me nowhere, I finally decided to undergo taking anti-depressant tablets. I was always a bit hesitant as to the fact that they are a temporary solution and would never fully cure my depression. However since taking this medication, it&rsquo;s almost as if all my dark thoughts, my anxiety and paranoia have all been completed numbed and killed off. For me it has managed to make my days go from being stood under a dark cloud to being under blue skies. This medication has helped me put my life on track and now I am training to become a nurse and feel in control of my mind and happiness. For anyone considering it&hellip;I would recommend."
