"I had Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder with intrusive thoughts.  This came out of nowhere and I ended up having to take time off work.  One week of sitting on the sofa crying my eyes out and having repeated panic attacks and thinking I was going crazy I then saw my doc.  She referred me to a psychologist and put me on Lexapro 5mg for 4 days and then up to 10mg.  She also gave me Valium to use sparingly initially till my anxiety dropped.  No change week 1 except day 1 where I felt a feeling of euphoria.  Week 2 had increase in anxiety even a panic attack. End of week 3 and I&#039;m back to my old self.  No more anxiety or intrusive thoughts.  I am doing all the things I use to do. I feel normal again.  Lexapro and seeing a psychologist has done wonders. Super happy."
