"I am 39 year old suffering from anxiety and panic disorders for 8 years. I started taking escitalopram 10 mg three weeks ago along with bromazepam 1.5 mg three times a day; it has started working since day 15 and I have started gaining confidence back with no panic attack in three weeks. My doctor has asked me to increase escitalopram to 20 mg and then stop bromazepam gradually. "
