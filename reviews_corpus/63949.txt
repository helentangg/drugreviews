"I&#039;ve been taking Sertraline for a little over 5 weeks now consistently, and I&#039;ve gradually noticed changes in my mood; I feel more motivated to make breakfast, do my makeup, do my hair, and do things that I used to love doing prior to my OCD and Depression flare up. I started off at 25mg, and I&#039;m now at 100mg.. I don&#039;t know if I&#039;m going to increase my dosage anymore but so far so good! :)"
