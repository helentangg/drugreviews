"Began this medication about 5 weeks ago. Currently taking 15mg (escitalopram) and obsessive worrying is SO much better/decreased. Minimal side effects in the beginning: some dizziness, some nausea but only at 5-10mg, tiredness that went away and so now take medicine in the morning as it will cause insomnia if I take it in the evening. My sleep is better, appetite better and I am back to exercising and anxiety is decreased. I am told I can continue to see results up to 12 weeks. "
