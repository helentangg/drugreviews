"I started taking Venlafaxine HCL ER 75mg and it has been working very well.  I also found out that my mood has changed for the better.  I have been taking it for a year now.  I haven&#039;t had any sleep problem from Venlafaxine and I also have diabetes and hypertension.  I have experienced running out of medicine and I can say that it wasn&#039;t that serious of a problem for me.  I refilled my prescription within five days.  What I would like to know it the best time to take my pill.  I have been taking it in the morning with my other medicine and food."
