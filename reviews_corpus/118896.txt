"I&#039;ve been having social anxiety my whole life and didn&#039;t even realize it. I also suffered from random panic attacks in the middle of the night. I became antisocial, I would isolate myself and lacked communication with my parents. I was very aggressive, had severe depression. I started self medicating with anything that made my depression feel better. I would pursue a quick fix and not realize how much more self harm I was causing to myself and my health. I became suicidal. I asked my teacher for help when I was getting worse. I have therapy and saw a psychiatrist. Zoloft has been really effective for me. I&#039;m no longer having rushing thoughts or feeling socially awkward around people."
