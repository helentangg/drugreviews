"Zoloft worked AWESOME for my extreme anxiety and major depression. It worked for many years but eventually (as all good things do), it stopped working as well and once my dosage couldn&#039;t go any higher, I had to start the whole process of finding the right medication and the right &quot;cocktail&quot; for me. Again, I&#039;d like to reiterate that Zoloft SAVED MY LIFE for MANY YEARS and only had to stop talking bc after about 7-10 years I guess my body didn&#039;t continue to respond like it used to."
