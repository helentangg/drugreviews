"I have been on quite a few different sleep meds because of my head injury. I now have &quot;Alpha Wave Intrusion&quot;, so my brain won&#039;t shut down. Been this way for 16 years now. Elival is the only Med that is able to get me to sleep and let me fall me back to sleep if I wake up. I&#039;m on 200mg and right now it seems to be okak. In a few months I&#039;ll probably have to adjust, but that&#039;s okak, I can deal with that. This is definitely an excellent choice for me."
