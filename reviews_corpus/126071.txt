"My doctor, gave me a sample packet with the the 10,20 and 40 mg. for my anxiety and depression. Overall I like it, my anxiety has gone away and depression is lessen! I recommend you take it with a full stomach because  it can cause dizziness. I like the 20 mg better 40mg was to strong! But I did notice some side effects, a lot of unexplained bruising and hair loss, decided to stop it but the withdrawals are scary but do go away, overall does help with depression and anxiety! Only reason I stop was because of bruising and hair loss was bugging me."
