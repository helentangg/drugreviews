"Zoloft, for me, has been a wonder drug.  It worked incredibly well for me in combating anxiety associated with Post Natal Depression.  Initially I had the shakes and dry mouth and a little dizziness, but that passed after a couple of weeks.  I highly recommend sticking with the side effects and trying it for at least 8 weeks.  From being almost bed bound, I completed a nursing degree, got a great job and am raising 2 kids as a single Mum.  I found keeping busy the helps with my anxiety.  CBT and Zoloft were, however, the most effective treatments for keeping panic at bay."
