"I started getting vertigo during my last pregnancy which transitioned to daily debilitating migraines with or w/o vertigo. After lots of testing my neurologist put me on Nortriptyline and it took about 6 months to get the dosage and migraines/vertigo under control but I am still on 75mg today for the past 7 years. I still have problems with dry mouth and I personally think it makes me a little forgetful (short term memory). I was a little lazy about taking it a few months ago and was wondering if it was still affective after 7 YEARS, and yes it is. One week after not taking it I got vertigo again which I haven&#039;t had in 3 years. So I&#039;ll be on this for life. I only get breakthrough migraines during my period for which I take a ketaprofen."
