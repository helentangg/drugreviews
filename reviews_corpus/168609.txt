"I&#039;ve been on Viibryd for a year now. Start up symptoms were upset stomach, diarrhea, and nausea. I got to about 10mg for a week and couldn&#039;t handle the nausea. So I backed off to about 5mgs. I had a good improvement and nausea went away. Tried to go back up to 10mg and by the 4th day I had the same results. Keep in mind anti-depressants are very powerful.  I had improvement from just 5 mg. My doc wrote me a script for 20 mg and I cut those into 4. I still have days where I don&#039;t feel well, but it has decreased my depression symptoms and panic attacks with minimal side effects. I gained a little weight about 7 lbs. No sexual side effects. Has to be taken with food."
