"For anyone who is hesitant about trying an anti depressant like Prozac because maybe you have too much pride, or you&#039;re embarassed that you have to take a pill everyday to feel like yourself. I was suffering with anxiety and depression for about 5 years after a really traumatic car accident and refused to try anything. I&#039;m in my early 20s I thought I was too young. I only wished I would&#039;ve listened to my body and mind sooner. Prozac changed my life. I only take 20mg and it is incredible. I feel happy.. I feel calm. I feel like my old self. I haven&#039;t had any anxiety in months.. I&#039;m not moody. It&#039;s like that big dark cloud is finally gone, don&#039;t be afraid to try this anti depressant. Im a brand new Me, because of it. I feel invincible"
