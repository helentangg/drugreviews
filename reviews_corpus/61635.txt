"Ive had an amazing experience with this drug, I&#039;ve been on it for close to over a year, because of my lifestyle and work I was always in high stress environments and I had anxiety to begin with.
A lot of my personality traits before I started citalopram were similar to one&#039;s of borderline personality disorder (though I don&#039;t actually have bpd) I take 20 MG. 
After about a month I could feel my mood increase and work started to seem a lot less frustrating, my only side effect is I bruise easily but I already did before the drug so to me it&#039;s not a huge deal.
It&#039;s amazing how helpful this drug has been for me, it&#039;s created me any positive things for me, I feel almost &quot;normal&quot;.
I recommend you take it DAILY.
Don&#039;t give up on this pill"
