"This pill made my life hell. It increased my suicidal ideation and I attempted a few times on it. I felt dissociation and I became even more depressed. They wouldn&#039;t let me off it, however, and actually increased my dosage to above the maximum adult dose before I finally was able to stop taking it. Upon stopping the medication I felt better and was less suicidal."
