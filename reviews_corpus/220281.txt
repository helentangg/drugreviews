"Last night was my first dose.  Half of a amitriptyline 25mg tablet.  I took it at quarter to midnight, but did not finally fall asleep until around 5AM.  I slept for almost twelve hours.  I guess I need to take it earlier if it doesn&#039;t knock me out like I expected.  The light hurts my eyes today.  I can&#039;t look out my window.  Artificial light isn&#039;t as bad, but still hurts.  Despite these problems, I feel more clear than I have in months. Maybe even years.  Any pain that I have is very slight, so I&#039;m thinking that&#039;s why my doctor wanted me to take ibuprofen with this - because it will actually be able to help with my pain now.  This is only after my first dose, but I am pretty excited.  I can move around the house again like a normal person!"
