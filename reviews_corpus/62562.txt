"I have been taking Celexa, in total for about 5 weeks.  My doctor started me at 10mg for a week, then 20mg for a week, then 40mg. I have been taking 40 mg for about 2.5 weeks now. Celexa helped my depression, which was from the anxiety and obssesive compulsive disorder, after about a week. I am also taking Klonopin 0.5mg at night to help me sleep. My doctor said it would take at least 3 weeks maybe as long as 6 weeks on my 40mg to control my severe anxiety and out of nowhere panic attacks. I made the mistake of taking myself off of my Klonopin this past Friday. I have gradually gotten worse since.  I am seeing my doctor today but I already know it&#039;s because I stopped taking my Klonopin too soon and the Celexa hasn&#039;t reached it&#039;s full potential yet."
