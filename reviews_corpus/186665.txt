"I just started today and wasn&#039;t expecting to see any difference as most antidepressant take weeks to see any difference. Today about 2 hrs after taking I felt so tired. Being at work didn&#039;t help. I have read many of the other comments and am hoping it&#039;s a miracle drug like a lot have said. I take Seroquel for sleeping that I think will help as a lot of others say Pristiq interferes with sleeping. Hopefully I will be back to write again and hopefully there will only be positive results to write about."
