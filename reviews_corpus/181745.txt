"Prozac (fluoxetine) I have been taking 10mg every 3 days for hot flashes for 2 years now.  It has worked very well for me.  I also don&#039;t have the mood swings. When I was taking 20mg everyday it was to much, So I talked with my doctor and changed it around.  If you are having problems you may be taking to much.  Talk to your doctor I did and I feel great."
