"I normally don&#039;t do reviews but I have to tell you what a difference this medication has made for me. I was on Paxil for years, regular and control release. I didn&#039;t understand why I felt so down when I was taking such a strong dose of SSRI. I hesitantly changed to Citalopram at the suggestion of my doctor and within days it had changed my life. I was no longer depressed, I felt my mood change drastically. My doctor and counsellor have suggested that the Paxil was actually doing me harm, because the new SSRI would not have normally worked that quickly. I have been on this medication for almost 3 months now and I feel great. I highly recommend it, and also for those who are still fighting to find the right med for you, keep fighting!!!"
