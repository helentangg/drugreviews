"I started Prozac as one of my first anti depressants for MDD

 It made me horribly sick. I was nauseous all day, and wouldn&#039;t eat for days at a time. I stayed on it to try and get thorough the side effects but they wouldn&#039;t stop, I was throwing up every other day

One day I woke up and I started to violently shake, This lasted for over 12 hours until I ended up in the hospital with Tachycardia. 

This was a horrible experience and months later I still have stomach and heart issues, I&#039;m on new medications now, But because of my bad experience I get very anxious when I take them"
