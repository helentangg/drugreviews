"After suffering with chronic idiopathic urticaria for 20 years, a new Dr. put me on this old medicine which has a VERY strong antihistamine effect.  It stopped the hives dead in their tracks, and now, being on the medication for 22 years, I have yet to ever develop another hive.  This medication is a GREAT.  I&#039;ve never used anything even remotely effective as this medication to prevent hives (even steroids wouldn&#039;t stop them!).  Doctors gave up on me and could never figure what the cause was/is.  Doesn&#039;t matter now as they completely under control."
