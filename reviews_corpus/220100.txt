"I started getting tension headaches everyday for months around the same time late in the afternoon.  No matter where I was, the cycle would continue and cause stress due to the headache.   A GP started me in 10mg daily.

It takes about two weeks to feel the effects.  This drug has greatly reduced my pain and helped break the cycle.

Side effects are morning drowsiness, occasionally blurry vision, and sleepiness."
