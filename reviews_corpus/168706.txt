"I was prescribed Viibryd due to  social anxiety issues (no depression symptoms) and nervous sweating. I began the starter pack w/10mg then leveled out at 40mg. I noticed anxiety issues began to lighten after the first week, but it seems like I was 2 months in on the 40 mg when I noticed this was really working.  I find that I&#039;m a lot more tolerable of people and stressful situations. It&#039;s been good for me.
I did experience a few side effects; leg cramps, some insomnia, and these loud explosions ( in search of a better disciption) while falling asleep.
I&#039;m 45 and this my first experience of any type of anxiety med, and I should have been taking this years ago"
