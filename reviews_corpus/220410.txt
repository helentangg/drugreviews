"I don&#039;t like taking medication, but my headaches were now in a state of chronic tension/migraine being triggered by anything excessive like exercising, too much cleaning, too much activity, too much light or stress. I was prescribed Elavil for headaches, irritable bowel syndrome, sleep trouble, back, neck, and arm pain. I&#039;ve taken it for a week, and after one dose, the first thing I noticed was an awesome night&#039;s sleep, and no neck or jaw pain, pain on rising.  I feel completely relaxed in the morning, a little drowsy but am able to function and get my three kids to school. I have been taking it at 10pm and feel tired until noon, so I think I&#039;m going to take it earlier in the evening. I haven&#039;t noticed any side effects at all. I am taking 10 mg."
