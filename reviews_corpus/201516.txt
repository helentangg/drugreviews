"I have now been on Zoloft for a solid 12 months (50mg).  It has changed my life.  I was prescribed it for depression, anxiety and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder - it has almost completely resolved issues I have had for most of my life.  I hesitated in taking it due to side-effects mostly because I have always been obsessed with my weight. I&#039;m happy to report that if anything, I have dropped weight in the last year. I no longer am tempted to binge eat and just lead a healthy and active lifestyle because I am happier. I really wanted someone to read this who was in my position - who was too scared to try it because of side-effects. My only side effects are dry eyes, I need to sleep 8 hours a night (instead of 5-6) and that&#039;s the worst of it!"
