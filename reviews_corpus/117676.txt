"I have been on this medicine for migraine prevention for just over a year now. I LOVE IT! I used to have chronic daily migraine (8 to 9 intensity) and multiple unexplained body pains and weakness (docs just thought it was part of the migraines because I tested negative for MS, lupus, Fibromyalgia), my migraines are now down to 1 to 3 a month and the body pains are gone! I ended up having a 4 week period where I didn&#039;t have any medicine due to a mailing issue and the migraines were back full force, along with the body pains. Been back on it for about a week and I feel like I&#039;m slowly getting better again. "
