"I am 60 years old and have suffered chronically from depression and anxiety. After alcohol stopped doing the trick 25 years ago, I started a long journey with anti-depressants Imipramine, which was very effective but had very unpleasant side effects. Over time I have taken Paxil, Effexor, Celexa and then a few years ago Lexapro (20 mg). While all of them were helpful, Lexapro has been a miracle- I often forget I have the disease."
