"So this drug really helped with my depression but it also has some bad side effects. Please please please never skip a dose of this stuff. You will feel like absolute trash. As long as I take it every 24 hours it works perfectly for both my anxiety and depression but if I miss a dose, the side effects are awful. My whole body feels like white noise, my limbs buzz, I&#039;m dizzy and nauseous, and can barely concentrate. Also, I don&#039;t know everyone else&#039;s experience with the medicine, but I used to be on the 150 mg dose and let me tell you. I couldn&#039;t orgasm no matter how much I wanted to and it sucked. I know it was the medicines fault cause when I lowered my dose to 75 mg I could orgasm again. The medicine ridiculously lowers my libido."
