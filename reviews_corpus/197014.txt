"My doctor started me on paroxetine about 6 weeks ago. In the last year i have known i was unhappy, stressed, suffering from panic attacks and felt myself being tired, frustrated, and unable to sleep. My mind would just not stop running! By the end of a work day i was so exhausted and grumpy i would hide in my bed blocking out the world. My kids never understood why i was how i was. Since starting on paroxetine i have become the person i used to be ! Im happy, energetic and sleeping much better! I dont need a nap in the afternoon anymore and once again  love my job! Ive had no side effects!"
