"I have tried almost every antidepressant out there in the last 20 years. Wellbutrin, Effexor, Prozac, Zoloft, and a few I can&#039;t remember with little to no effect. Viibryd has been the absolute best and made a huge difference life is much more enjoyable and I have a lot more energy and actually want to get out and do things again. My irritability has gone way down. Another great thing is it doesn&#039;t decrease your sex drive at all if anything it has increased because I feel so much better."
