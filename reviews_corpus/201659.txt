"The only reason I&#039;m giving this medication an 8 is because of the initial side effects and the time it took to find an adequate dose. I&#039;ve been on Zoloft for around 6 months now. I had suffered with panic disorder for most of my adult life, I&#039;m currently 29 years old. I tried a few different SSRIs, but never really gave them a chance. I relied on Ativan taken twice daily, totaling 2 mg. I started out taking 25 mg of Zoloft and worked up to 150 mg daily. At first, it was fairly difficult and I&#039;m really surprised that I didn&#039;t just give up within a few days, let alone a few weeks. I read many reviews on here and wondered if that would ever be me. If I was asked 5 months ago, I never would have had anything good to say. But now ...it changed my life."
