"I&#039;ve had Occipital Neuralgia for nearly 3 years and have gone through 8 Neurologists who tried all the current treatments including radio frequency ablation (burning) without long term relief.  We decided to try some of the anti-depressant medications and started with Cymbalta.  In 3 months I was pain free and have had no problems since I started the drug about 2 years ago."
