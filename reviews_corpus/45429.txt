"I have been dealing with Major Depressive Disorder for 9 years of my life, along with PTSD, and severe anxiety. I have been on so many different medications for depression, and have found that Prozac is the only anti-depressant that works for me. I have been as low as 10 mg, now currently on 20 mg. I am considering going to 30 mg. I have to see how I feel in the next number of days. I have been on this medication steadily for 6 months or so. I do have face twitches, but they are very minor and don&#039;t come very often. It really does help me get out into the world, and not be so affected by things emotionally. It&#039;s crucial to my well being and emotional state, and has prevented me from hurting myself for a long time."
