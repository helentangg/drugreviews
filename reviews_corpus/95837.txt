"I think Zoloft can work well for panic disorders. I would&#039;ve given it an 8-9, but the start up side effects were pretty rough for about 2 weeks, and a lot of other things seem to interact with it...at least in my case. I can&#039;t drink, at all. If I do, I experience side effects again for 2-3 days, including increased anxiety. Also, I&#039;ve noticed that if I take ibuprofen or Tylenol, I also experience side effects again. I thought perhaps I was being paranoid, but there&#039;s actually studies that confirm they decrease effectiveness of SSRI&#039;s. When I don&#039;t drink or take pain meds, it works wonderfully, but its a bit of a pain. It also seems to help if you suffer from migraines."
