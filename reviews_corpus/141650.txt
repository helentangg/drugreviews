"Lexapro has SAVED my life! I was struggling with extreme Irritable bowel syndrome symptoms, took every medicine for it. Lexapro was the only thing that has helped me. I now feel like a normal person! If you are struggling with IBS please give Lexapro a try. I take 10 mg once a day... but START AT HALF THE DOSE, I started at 5mg for two weeks then went up to the 10 mg. This eliminated getting bad side effects, the only side effect I got was a little nausea for the first couple of days but then it went away.

Good luck to everyone, I hope Lexapro will help you all as much as it has helped me."
