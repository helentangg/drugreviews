"I have been suffering from anxiety for about 1.5 years.

I am a big believer in natural medicine and psychotherapy. I have tried EVERYTHING .
I exercise daily, I eat healthy, I take vitamins I tried meditation, vitamins -You name it.
The anxiety started when I began dieting for a body building competition I lost about 10kilos and got down to a small amount of body fat. At this stage my periods stopped and I stopped producing estrogen and progesterone. I always told my mum and close friends it just felt like something inside me was &#039;missing&#039;.
I&#039;ve been on Lexapro for 2 days and everything has changed. I can&#039;t BELIEVE it and I cannot believe I&#039;ve wasted 1.5 years feeling that bad. You don&#039;t realize how bad it is until you feel relief."
