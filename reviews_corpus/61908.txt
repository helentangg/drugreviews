"Had extremely intense acute anxiety and panic disorder. For about 4 months. Tried everything in the book except meds - saw about 30% improvement. Then started on meds. No effect until 12th day (in fact, anxiety was stronger) where I felt a small bit of calmness. Side effects were very intense but kept going. Gradually, I kept getting better. There were periods of plateau and sometimes even feelings that it has stopped working. But today, I am on my 49th day (full 7 weeks) and I can say that it is 99.99999% gone. I feel like my old self. No panic attacks, no anxiety (thoughts or bodily sensations) - nothing. I started off 10mg on the first week and then moved onto 20mg. I am still on 20mg."
