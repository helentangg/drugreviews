"Zoloft is not a good medicine for &quot;severe&quot; depression. I have OCD and that is what this medicine is best used for. It does help with the anxiety and the headaches that go along with it. It keeps the obsessive thoughts to a minimum. My compulsive need to make everything perfect is also gone. It makes you more social too. It has not made me gain weight. It is a good drug if used for OCD."
