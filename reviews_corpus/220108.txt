"This is the only medication I can take that gives me some relief from the pain I suffer in my back and leg.  I have disc damage and nerve damage.  I at time can be taking 75mg per night and other times only 20mg pain dependent.  The only side effect I suffer is the chronic munchies the next day till I have completely flushed the drugs out of my system and a slight dopey-ness. Without these I would not get any sleep at night, these guarantee me 3 solid hours and some pain relief."
