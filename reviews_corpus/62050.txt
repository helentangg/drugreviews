"I&#039;ve suffered from depression/social anxiety for years. After a recent breakup, my depression spiraled out if control. My doc put me on Remeron for about a month which did nothing
Except help me sleep. In the past I&#039;ve taken: Prozac,
Paxil, Zoloft, Wellbutrin,
Lexapro and Buspar. I was just prescribed 20mg Celexa a week ago and WOW-the constant racing cynical voices have been silenced-instead of picturing worst case scenarios I&#039;m picturing best case scenarios-I haven&#039;t felt this &quot;at peace&quot; feeling for SO LONG. I&#039;m excited, because the dark cloud is lifting more by the day. I haven&#039;t experienced any side effects."
