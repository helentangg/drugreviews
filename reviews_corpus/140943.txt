"During the first three weeks I was tired and exhausted constantly. It affected me majorly in my daily life and I could barely get up in the morning. Slept 12-14 hours a day, but after 3 weeks the major side effects were gone (except for nausea every once in a while and no libido.)
I didn&#039;t feel any change in mood, so I recently changed to Brintellix."
