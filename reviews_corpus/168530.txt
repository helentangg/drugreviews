"Parnate is the second-greatest thing to ever happen to my brain, second only to ECT. I started it in the hospital. Before Parnate I was spending about 22 hours per day in bed. Now I am in bed just at night. I have started to laugh again. I&#039;m looking for work after being unable to hold down a job for over 2 years. My parents see the improvement too and they are really pleased. 
Just be careful. Everyone talks about the food interactions, but you also got to be aware of the medication interactions, those can be deadly. I had a hypertensive crisis as a result of a drug interaction that nearly ended things. Before Parnate I would have viewed that as a missed opportunity, but now I want to live again!"
