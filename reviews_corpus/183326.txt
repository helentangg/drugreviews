"Was taking Cymbalta for depression when my hip arthritis flared up.  I had seen the ads about Cymbalta for use in arthritis, but wasn&#039;t really taking it for that reason, so I didn&#039;t think too much about it. I switched to another depression medicine, after a period of weaning because of the high cost and side effects of Cymbalta.  Within 2 weeks my arthritis pain had become intense, almost unbearable.  Guess they are right in saying it helps with the pain.  It didn&#039;t totally remove the pain, but it did keep it under control.  Now I am struggling to find something else to help with the pain."
