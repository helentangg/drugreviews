"I have suffered from depression since I was 14 (I am 22 now).  I&#039;ve tried Lexapro and Celexa, but Lexapro was too expensive and Celexa quit working for me after a few months.  Prozac has completely taken away all suicidal ideations (which I have had almost daily since I was 14) and has made life so much easier for me to handle.  I can&#039;t believe that I have been missing out all this time! It&#039;s hard to believe that other people really live this way, without constant depression and anxiety, every day! I am so happy I found this medication. I did not know if it was possible to completely get rid of those thoughts.  Amazing medicine."
