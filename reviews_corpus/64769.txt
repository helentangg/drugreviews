"I am female, 27, UK based. I got this drug on prescription and it costs me &pound;8.75 per month. I have suffered with depression from being around 15 years old and have always been on Citalopram. After a while it stopped working so I weaned off it and stopped taking medication altogether. Big Mistake, depression came back after about 2 months. Went to docs and was prescribed Sertraline, within two weeks it has worked wonders. I am not completely consumed by my depression, I am a lot less paraniod, negative and irritable. Its worked wonders already! I had a night of anxiety but it passed quite quickly. I&#039;m on 50mg and take it in the mornings. It helps me stay awake all day too! Highly recommended."
