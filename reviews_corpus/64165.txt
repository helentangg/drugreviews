"This medicine has been a game changer for me. At first I was terrified of taking this drug.  After reading Catholic Guide to Depression and much prayer I had the courage to take the medicine.  I&#039;m so glad I did.  It actually reduced &quot;body aches&quot;. I&#039;m running  again, 6 days a week.    It&#039;s not a miracle pill, but a fantastic tool in defeating depression and body aches. Peace!"
