"I saw this medication as a marvel, until I started taking it. I had no problems, except for some nausea, during the first 2-3 months I was on it. And it seemed to help somewhat with pain. Then the fun began: restless legs syndrome, insomnia, horrible sweating even when it was cold, urinary incontinence and frequency, muscle spasms, elevated liver enzymes...but hey, there&#039;s another medication for all those side effects. Finally after 3 years, I had had enough and was ready to move on. Unfortunately, the Lilly recommended taper is downright dangerous. After the alternating 60mg/30mg and drop to 30 mg, I was in full blown Cymbalta discontinuation syndrome.  Look it up; it&#039;s not pretty. Run away from this med as fast as you can."
