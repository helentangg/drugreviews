"I started on 10mg of Lexapro and thought I&#039;d struck gold with how much it improved my quality of life - I was only surviving before on Zoloft, but with Lexapro I felt alive for the first time in decades. Unfortunately, after a couple of years I found the effects started to wear off, so I went up to 20mg. Same thing happened again - felt fantastic , but after a couple of years the effects started wearing off again. I tried Cymbalta - no good for me, then tried Pristiq 50mg, then 100mg then 150mg. No good for me either. I&#039;ve gone back to Lexapro again - have worked my way up to 20mg in the last 2 weeks, and am feeling so much better for it. If the effects wear off again I&#039;ll go up to 30mg Lexapro. It&#039;s the best one I&#039;ve found for me so far."
