"I started taking this medication a month ago. My doctor had been prescribing me Xanax for 10 years and felt this was the cure for my anxiety. I experienced worsening anxiety and panic attacks. I felt really irritable and still do. By the 5th week I was beginning to feel hopeless and not wanting to get out of bed. I&#039;m always tired, and I have gained 10 lbs in 5 weeks. I&#039;m supposed to take it for another month and if it still doesn&#039;t help then I get to taper off. I accidentally missed a dose and felt miserable. I had no energy, and felt like electric shocks were popping my brain cells. I still have anxiety and feel like this medication gave me depression."
