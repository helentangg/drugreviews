"I&#039;ve suffered from migraines since I was a teen but as a adult they became unbearable. After the death of my mother going on 5 yrs this December and a year to the date then my grandmother my depression was at a high. I don&#039;t think is describable. My nerves and patience were all over the place my migraines had gotten to the point I had to take shots for the pain! I was rushed to the hospital one day for a headache that I felt was going to take my life the same as a headache did my mom. I had swelling on the brain I was put on three different combinations of meds out of the three I figured out the amitriptyline was the one that managed all my symptoms especially my headaches and later discovered my insomnia! To this day I still take it."
