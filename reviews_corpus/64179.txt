"I&#039;ve dealt with OCD, generalized-anxiety and PTSD for years and it had completely destroyed my life. I lost all my friends, could not work, was extremely close to being homeless although my parents helped me, avoided the public in general, etc.

The reason I&#039;m on medication including Zoloft is for rage, aggressive tendencies, hatred towards humans, hypervigilence, sensitivity to sudden sounds, distrust, flashbacks, etc.

Along with staying healthy (eating very well, working out, etc.) Zoloft has helped me remain a lot more calm and has helped with my aggressive and violent tendencies.

I&#039;ve been on 200mg for about 4 months now. It&#039;s not a miracle drug for me but it&#039;s helped a lot combined with other things."
