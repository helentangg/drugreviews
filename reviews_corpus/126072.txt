"I have been on Vibryd for almost a year now. Right after it was approved. I had minor issues for the first couple of weeks. But it works great for anxiety issues. I would fly off the handle for the smallest things and Viibryd totally takes that away. My granddaughter isn&#039;t worried about going out shopping or eating with me. Seriously, it was horrible. I&#039;m sure it is menopause related but I couldn&#039;t control it. VIIBRYD did.  Only drawback is memory issues. It did state that in the brochures, but I just have to concentrate that much harder. Best of luck to everyone."
