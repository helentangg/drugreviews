"I have taken Sertraline for two years now. I have never had a problem. I started off with 100 mg, and now take 50mg. I used to cry all the time, and found myself deeply depressed when there was something sad.

Now I hear myself laughing and it shocks me--- wow ! That&#039;s a sound I haven&#039;t heard in a long time!  It takes a lot to make me cry now, and I am the non-worrier, relaxed person that I want to be. I have had no side effects or problems."
