"Have been on 40mg daily for almost 2 years after experiencing a traumatic illness that almost killed me.  Citalopram has saved my life by allowing me to function with some degree of normality.  I am a 63 year old male who will probably have to take this medicine for the rest of my life.  And believe me, I will do so without complaint!"
