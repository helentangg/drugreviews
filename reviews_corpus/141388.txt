"I started Lexapro for major anxiety and moderate depression. I&#039;m on 6 weeks and finally feeling better. I am more energized and motivated than ever. Because of my bad anxiety, I went from 5mg, to 10mg, and then to 20mg. It&#039;s been a long battle but I am feeling hopeful again and want to do things! The anxiety is still barely there. The depression is gone! I can&#039;t wait until I see the full effects at around 2 months."
