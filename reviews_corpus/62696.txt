"I took citalopram for a about year for depression and anxiety. I felt a lot better so asked the doctor to take me off the medicine. She thought I was coming off it too soon and she was right. Two weeks later I had to go back to my doctor and she put me back on them. I am feeling better but I feel a little breathless and have muscle cramps so I will have to ask her about this. I think it&#039;s a side effect of citalopram but the medication makes me feel normal again."
