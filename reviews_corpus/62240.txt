"In November 2012, After 4 years of unbearable symptoms (dizziness, headaches, facial neuralgia, sweats, spikes in blood pressure, ataxia, feeling like I was about to have a seizure) from about 5 times a week to 4 times a day and with medical investigations exhausted I decided it was time to try an SSRI.

I had always insisted my symptoms caused my anxiety; not the other way round.  Because of this, I put off taking the medication for about 2 years.

I started on November 30th on 10mg.   Felt slightly odd the next day but immediately noticed the anxiety was lessened.  After 7 days I went onto 20mg/day.  Things just got better and better.  I&#039;m still on the same dose now (Sept 2013).  For me it has been fantastic. I&#039;m pretty much 100% my old self."
