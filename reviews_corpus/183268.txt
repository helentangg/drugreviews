"I am a 23 year old girl and I have suffered from anxiety for as long as I can remember. I had tried so many different medicines from Paxil, Zoloft, Prozac and Celexa... nothing worked. I would get a little better but once again, I would suffer a horrible bout of anxiety attacks. The first day I started Cymbalta I felt a rush of calmness over me. I immediately felt at ease and not as ansy and nervous as I always was. I could finally relax and do everyday normal things without worrying about when I would suffer another attack and would ruin my day. I have not had an attack in about 3 months now and feel so great! I do not feel zoned out like I did on the other medicines. I am happy and confident and overall have a better sense of well being."
