"I&#039;ve been on Celexa now for 4 weeks and have noticed improvement in my mood/stress and anxiety. I would recommend to take it at night as that way you won&#039;t feel as tired when you get up and you aren&#039;t aware of other symptoms as much. I take it an hour before I go to bed and I can start to feel tired so it does help with sleep. I started at 10 now at 20 and I think I&#039;ll see if I can go to 25mg. I still take the clonazepam at night too though I was taking 1 pill I cut back to 1/2 a pill as in the morning I was really groggy. In the end you do have to work with this medication. It&#039;s not for everyone, you will have side effects that for the most part will go away and like any other medicine it&#039;s trial and error."
