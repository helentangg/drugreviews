"So the beginning of this year I witnessed a traumatic event when walking back from college. I saw a man hang himself on a bridge whilst cars were going &amp; coming under neath. The bridge was quite high. After the event I thought, the event hasn&rsquo;t shocked me as much as I thought it would? About a month or few months later I have PTSD, I&rsquo;m suddenly anxious, scared of myself, on edge &amp; depressed  I go to the doctors when things got worse as I was scared of myself in the mirror lol, and she prescribed me the sertraline. I was on 50mg &amp; am now on 25mg (I have to cut the tablet in half) I am back to normal and feel fine, happy and my old self! Sometimes dodgy. The event is in the back of my mind, but the drug is good. Hopefully will give it up soon"
