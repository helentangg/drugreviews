"I have suffered from depression for years. I&#039;m 33 years old and have been on and off medications since I was 12. I was on Zoloft for years. Which worked for me, the sexual side effects really got to me and my marriage which ended in divorce. I decided to give Viibryd a try. I lasted a month. At first, it started to help. I wasn&#039;t as edgy and had more patience with my children. However I hated the way this medication made my stomach feel. I felt bloated all he time and my stomach was always making gurgling sounds. After week 4 I started to become irritable and just couldn&#039;t deal with it. I am going to try Wellbutrin now. On day two so far so we&#039;ll see how it goes!"
