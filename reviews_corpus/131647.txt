"I have tried zoloft and cymbalta. All equally effective in my anxiety level but I find effexor has been the best. While I still don&#039;t have a ton of energy, I was a zombie on the other two. My libido is back to normal and I&#039;m not hungry 24/7. Zoloft would be my second choice, except I needed to nap everyday and I was always hungry. Cymbalta was very difficult to get off of and I was also very tired. Negative effects of effexor include  insomnia - i have urges where i HAVE to get up- but usually melatonin and reading, and NO electronics before bed help that (or xanax as needed.) I also sweat a lot more on it. But having more energy and more libido make it worth it. I have to take a beta blocker because I speak infront of people."
