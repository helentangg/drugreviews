"I take Amitriptyline with carbamazepine. I was diagnosed with trigeminal neuralgia type 2. I take Amitriptyline 10-30 mg in the evening and its the only thing that has relieved me of the shocking pain I feel and the end of my jaw. At first I felt immense drowsiness, but as my body got used to the drug and that side effect went away. The pain is gone now, I am able to eat, drink and shower without the pain. It&#039;s been great. I don&#039;t have any side effects."
