"I have been taking nortriptyline 10mg capsules (6 capsules for 60 mg) every night before I go to bed for over 3 months now.  I was involved in a MVA collision by a drunk driver and I now suffer constant head pain. I now have Post Concussive Head Syndrome.  I was taking narcotics constantly because of the head pain, I do not have migraines.  I was able to be seen by a neurologist and because of the frustration and anger I had against the drunk driver, well the nortriptyline has help considerably in my head pain and also feeling depressed. The only side effect I am experiencing is dry mouth and sleeplessness.  I am now taking it 2 to 3 hours before I go to sleep. There was a couple of times I missed the doses and the pain was there again."
