"Lexapro has changed my life. I&#039;m now out of a 2  long year depression, and have no more anxiety, no more ruminations, nothing. I feel at peace with myself, I&#039;m feeling happier about my life every day, and have learned to forgive, love and accept myself as I am. I no longer feel shame or guilt for mistakes or my flaws. I feel incredibly positive and in control of my thoughts and feelings. Everyone will have a different experience, but at last I have found something that has truly changed my life for the better."
