"I was on Wellbutrin for three years, my anxiety and panic started getting worse. The doctor took me off wellbutrin and put me on 25mg of zoloft for the first two weeks, now I&#039;m on 50mg a day.  It seems to be working!! Im on my third week now and the anxiety is getting better and better daily.  I am pleased with it so far :)   Anxiety and panic attacls is no way to live,  I never knew how someone would want to take their own life until I experienced it first hand.  Thank God for mediacation!"
