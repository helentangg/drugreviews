"Have had experience with several other antidepressants and so far Pristiq has had 0 undesirable side effects. No allergic response, no first week horrors, no insomnia, nothing awful what-so-ever. I feel optimistic, happy and no longer manic. Hoping to check back in a few months time to give further updates."
