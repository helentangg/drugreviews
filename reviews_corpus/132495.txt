"Difficulty sleeping through nite I did sleep first night but then most of next day on silenor.  2nd night tossed and turned but slept for about 4 hours. Felt drugged the next day. Took 3rd night slept off and on. Felt horrible next day, tired, weak feeling, headache. Also leaves mouth extremely dry.  Not going to take silenor any more."
