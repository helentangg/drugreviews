"I&#039;m 39 (almost 40) I&#039;ve got 3 kids and have been on this medicine for the last 18 years. I went off of it once when I was pregnant and kept taking it when I had my youngest. He is 14 now and healthy as a lark. I have suffered from anxiety and panic disorder since I was 16. It&#039;s been a rough ride but I don&#039;t think I could&#039;ve done it without this medication. I took 50mg for a few years then 75mg and I just started on 100mg. The side effects suck but they go away and are worth living again. I&#039;m on day 5 of 100mg and have had panic attack but I am able to calm myself down. I can tell my appetite has increased but when I feel better and can get out of the house and drive I will start excerising again. It&#039;s not going to work immediately be patient"
