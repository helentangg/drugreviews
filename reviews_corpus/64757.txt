"in the year 1997 I was suffering form severe depression.  Was put on  100mg of Zoloft and Busperone.  I am taking zoloft now for eighteen years.  Busperone for fifteen years. I am now off Busperone.  Afraid to go off zoloft, don&#039;t ever want to go through what I went through for many years.  I was on zoloft for 18 years, I have now droped down to 50mg.  Plan to go on 25mg soon."
