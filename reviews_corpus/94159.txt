"Like many, many others, I&#039;ve tried them all. Most of the recent AD&#039;s (Viibryd, etc) have been pretty mediocre, but I found myself doing at least as well on Brintellix as the first time I started Zoloft (my reference for a good antidepressants). I didn&#039;t really experience any side effects and eventually titrated up to 20mg per day. After almost a year at this dose, I still haven&#039;t experienced any side effects, find that my sexual response is uninhibited, and there has been no poop-out. Compared to all the others, I think Brintellix is the best I&#039;ve tried yet. The reason I don&#039;t rate it 10 is that while it has been more effective than other meds, I still feel there is quite a room for improvement."
