"I&#039;m 17 years old and I&#039;ve been diagnosed with depression. I went to my GP and he prescribed me Fluoxetine. I&#039;ve been on for about 3 months now, and I love them. I don&#039;t cry anymore but fluoxetine has made me alot more tired and restless. Also I found my skin was looking a lot nicer and it was so clear and zit free."
