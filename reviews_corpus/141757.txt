"I have been taking Lexapro for 2 and a half weeks and I already feel tons better. I have terrible GAD and my anxiety has gotten a whole lot better already. I dont just sit around and worry constantly about everything anymore, which is wonderful. I really think Lexapro is going to work for me. The side effects are also minimal which is great. I was on Pristiq before Lexapro and the side effects were so horrible that I only took it for a week. So, compared to that I think Lexapro is absolutely wonderful."
