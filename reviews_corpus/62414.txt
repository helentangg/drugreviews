"I have been on citalopram for about 18 months and I wish I had done this at least 10 years ago.  I have always been a worry wart but it was getting to the point where I was worried and stressed about anything and everything.  Generalized anxiety disorder is what I have.  Anyway, this was the best thing I have done. Works for me and I have no complaints."
