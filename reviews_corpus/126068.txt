"Viibryd has lifted me out of the depths and has helped me put meaning back into my life. It&#039;s not a miracle, however, it does lift the burden of depression to a point where I am capable of utilizing skills and coping strategies effectively. It&#039;s expensive and it&#039;s very very new. I experienced very mild side effects at the beginning of treatment such as mild nausea and migraine in addition to panic attacks that eventually went away (thankfully) but these symptoms dissipated within two days of each initial titration. I&#039;m currently at 40mg and I&#039;m feeling great. I&#039;m one of the lucky ones I suppose as I have not had to try too many medications."
