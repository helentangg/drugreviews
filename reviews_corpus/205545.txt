"I am 26, female and have been on Pristiq for a little over 18 months. It worked fantastic for the first year, my anxiety and depression was under control for the first time ever. For the last few months though I have noticed a lot more side effects, I have gained weight and although my sex drive hasn&#039;t dropped I find it very hard to reach orgasm. Also if I miss one day I have really bad withdrawals - migraine headaches, nausea, dizzy spells and out of control emotions. I think Pristiq is great for short term use but I&#039;m not convinced its good as a long term option."
