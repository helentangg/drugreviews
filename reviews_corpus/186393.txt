"Hey Everyone!  This is new to me (posting on a forum). I have struggled with depression for the last 28 years, but only started taking medicines around 12 years ago.  I think I &quot;thought&quot; my depression was &quot;normal&quot; before 12 years ago. I&#039;ve been on Prozac (liked it a lot, except for decreased libido), Effexor, Serzone, Lexapro, Cymbalta and now Pristiq. I&#039;ve only been on Pristiq for a week (50 mg).  I also take Vyvanze for ADHD, so not sure side effects are due to which medicine or both combined.  I&#039;m writing because I noticed two side effects since taking Pristiq that no one has mentioned: really, really BIZARRE dreams at night. The other is I am so tired in the morning.  Like I&#039;ve been hit by a Mack truck. "
