"I&#039;ve been on Effexor XR before and was off it  for a few years. Life got tough again and new dr put me on 10 mg lexapro. After a week, I can see light at the end of the tunnel and it might not be a freight train! After months of not being able to get back to sleep when I wake in the middle of the night,  I&#039;m now sleeping much better. Fuzzy thinking and digestive upset for a few days.  I don&#039;t have much of an appetite, but that is really a good thing! I feel a little more focused too. I can feel my mental energy returning. So far so good."
