"I&#039;m taking 75 mg Effexor XR and my life is changing for the better.  I no longer feel stress when I&#039;m around people.  Socializing is not such an ordeal anymore.
My social anxiety started when I was 12.  Wish Effexor was around back then.  Hope Effexor helps everyone. First 10 days are not easy:  anxiety , teeth clenching , nausea and diarrhea.. hang in there and give it time to work."
