"My genius psychiatrist started me on this drug in the fall of 2008.  The first few weeks I felt even worse than before I had started taking the fluoxetine.  After many months on the drug I was eventually taking 400mg a day, and having manic thoughts &amp; episodes.  My psychiatrist decided I was bi-polar and then started me on seroquel (rather than give me a break for my nervous system to re-adjust to it&#039;s natural state), which I also ended up taking for about 6 months and at about the same dose.  In retrospect I wish I hadn&#039;t taken either fluoxetine(Prozac) or seroquel(Quetiapine)."
