"I am a recovering opiate addict and alcoholic.  I have been sober for five years and extremely grateful.  However, I have been diagnosed several times by physicians as having depression.  It got so bad about a month ago that I decided to try Prozac 20mg.  I have been on Celexa in the past but it made feel disconnected.  The Prozac took about three weeks to kick in but it is working wonderfully now for a few days.  It is like a switch was flipped and I just feel normal and positive.  I do have some of the usual side effects but they are bearable.  Everyone is different for sure but I am very pleased with Prozac thus far.  If you are trying this medicine, stick with it as it does take a while to have an effect.  very grateful!"
