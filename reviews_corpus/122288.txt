"I have tried several medications for my major depression over the years and Emsam side effects have, by far, been the smallest.  There are no sexual side effects, no weight gain, etc.  My moods are not &quot;monotone&quot; like I had felt on some of the other medications.  The only drawback to this medication, in my opinion, is the food/drink watch.  I personally don&#039;t have to modify much, but if you drink a lot or eat a lot of aged foods, this will be an issue for you on Emsam.  Also this is an MAOi so there are medication interactions as well.  But mood wise, depression, anxiety...this is the best ever!"
