"I&#039;ve been on Pritiq two years now and it&#039;s a nightmare to get off of them.  I wish I would have never started them going off of them is so hard the side effects are probably close to an addict coming off drugs.  I&#039;ve only missed a dose and I feel like hell. 

DO NOT GO ON THEM TRY ANOTHER ANTIDEPRESSANT!!

If I knew then what I know now about the withdrawal effects I would have stayed on Citalipram.  as Pritiq is time released pill you can&#039;t just take a smaller dose to go off.  Living nightmare as I don&#039;t find much benefit from them for depression and now I can&#039;t get off them without feeling like I&#039;m going insane."
