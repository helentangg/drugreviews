"I have been taking citalopram for less then a week now. I have most of the side effects insomnia , feeling detached and more anxious. The only thing that is keeping me going is the positive reviews on here. I know that it is meant to get worse before it gets better but do people know how long this takes ? The first 2 days I took 20mg and felt quite out of it so I went down to half a pill 10 mg for a couple of days. Now I am back on the 20mg and still feeling quite rough. Tried to go out and carry on with my normal life and fainted while I was out. Don&#039;t think that&#039;s to do with the pills but my overall condition of feeling stressed and weak. I am praying and hoping this works."
