"Did not take too long to go to sleep. Had some dreams but not nightmares. Woke with dry mouth and a little groggy.  Within an hour of being up, I feel very alert, almost energetic, not sure how to explain it, just overall feel better than I have in weeks. Last night was my first dose of 25 mg.  So we will see how it goes, hope I don&#039;t gain weight, as I have read about. I have had sleep issues for years and tried everything, hope this continues to work. "
