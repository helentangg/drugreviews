"I&#039;ve only taken 25mg Zoloft for a week and am scheduled to increase to 50mg in one more week. I had such a horrible reaction to three doses of Lexapro that my psychiatrist switched to Zoloft. An hour or two after taking the Zoloft, I feel calm, and then there is an uptick in my anxiety and I get fidgety and sometimes mildly panicky. I am also taking 0.5 to 1mg, Xanax per day, which we will ease off of once the Zoloft kicks in, and I have weekly visits with a good therapist. My anxiety ramped up to critical mass into a weather phobia (we&#039;re in KC), so springtime is a nightmare for me. I&#039;m a gardener, so this disorder has sucked all the joy out of the thing I love to do most. I pray my experience is as positive as many I&#039;ve read here."
