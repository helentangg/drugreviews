"I&#039;ve been taking Effexor for approximately 3 months now. Previously I was on Cipralex for depression and anxiety. I have been feeling very tired and hungry all the time! I&#039;ve gained 10lbs since starting Effexor! I don&#039;t feel like it&#039;s working for me, as my anxiety is still out of control. But everyone&#039;s different."
