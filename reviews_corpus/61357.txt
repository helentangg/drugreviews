"I&#039;ve been on and off of citalopram for the past 5 years (mostly on). I deal with GAD, depression, and PTSD.  The therapeutic dose of 20 mg was what I was on initially, bumped to 40 as stress increased. This drug really helped me deal with my mixed bag of symptoms effectively.  However, it caused anorgasma.  Also caused a chronically stuffed nose as the dose increased."
