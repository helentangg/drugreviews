"I started taking citalopram  for a number of reasons but ultimately  all connected  to life long anxiety. Initially I was on 10 mg once per day. I found this resulted in ups and downs. I tried taking 10 mg  morning and evening. 20 mg in total. This has really helped to balance things out. I still get drowsy but this is compensated by coffee! I think that I will need to be on citalopram for life as my anxiety is life long and I am unable to control it without medication.... I. E. All the negative thoughts etc are real to me. I find I can now and can live a fairly full and normal  life. Even drink alcohol. I know that if I do stop taking citalopram, things will return back to the way they were."
