"I started at 25mg for a week. I had 2 good days and the other days were from my normal anxiety. I then went up to 50mg and felt not too bad except for days 6 and 7. Had some minor sleep problems but managed to get through. I jumped to 75mg three days ago and now I&#039;m feeling like garbage. My anxiety shot up. I feel depressed. I feel weird. I slept only 3.5 hours the last two nights. My stomach feels empty but I did have breakfast and I&#039;m not hungry. I know I need to give it at least a week or two on the higher dosage but I&#039;m so disappointed and discouraged. I wish I can start feeling better."
