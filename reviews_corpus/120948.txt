"This drug did help with hot flash but BEWARE! It&#039;s horrible if you miss a dose or  and when you need to get off  of it.  Brain &#039;zaps&#039;, dizziness, crying jags, depression, and more can last for months, even when you ween off according to directions.  The withdrawal is horrendous. Please be very thoughtful before you decide to take this drug."
