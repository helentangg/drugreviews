"I had my first panic attack almost two years ago. It spiraled from there and I started having panic attacks so bad when I was driving that it got to a point where I could not drive at all. I also had panic attacks when I was trying to fall asleep. I told myself and my doctor I wanted to &quot;beat&quot; this without any medicine. I started counseling, and while that helped a little, it wasn&#039;t enough. Finally I told my doctor I was ready to start meds and it is the best thing I have done for myself! The first few weeks were pretty rough, and my anxiety increased during that time. But after four weeks I started feeling much better. Now I can drive again and my anxiety is 90% better. And what remains of it is much more easily controlled."
