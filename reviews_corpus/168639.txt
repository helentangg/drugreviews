"I tried this for anxiety, but unfortunately it killed my stomach and I had to stop after 2 weeks. Upon the first dose, I became very nauseous. I moved the dosing time to after my largest meal, but it did not help. My stomach would cramp for 3 hours after taking the pill. It gave my heartburn also. I had zero appetite and could not even think about eating a vegetable for all 14 days. I could only eat very bland foods in very tiny amounts. I have gastritis and this drug flared it so badly, I had to take Prilosec. If you have stomach/GI issues of any kind, I would not suggest this drug. I would also advise you check with your insurance on the cost. I was given a sample pack, then called my insurance and it was going to be $223/month for me."
