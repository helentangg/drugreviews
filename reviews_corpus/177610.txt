"Cymbalta actually did help, but please talk to your Dr as soon as possible if you notice any changes in your vision. I was literally 2 weeks away from going blind .I was in my early 40s and developed severe cataracts in both eyes very quickly. After seeing several doctors and specialists I had them removed.One of the specialists did research and found that cymbalta was the cause, a very rare side effect but it can happen."
