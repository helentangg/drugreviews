"Lexapro has been an absolute miracle for me.  I had become so depressed I could no longer get out of bed, and was crying every day.  I hated the idea of getting on medicines, but I felt at that point I had no choice.  The only regret I have now is that I didn&#039;t do it sooner.  I had some pretty bad fatigue on the medicine for the first month or two, but that has now gone away.  I am so glad I finally did this."
