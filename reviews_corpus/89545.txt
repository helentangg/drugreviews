"I have had depression my whole life. Tried Zoloft, Effexor, and 3 other medicines. I have been on this for a month now and its been great. Still have sadness but that&#039;s normal because I lost my dad not to long ago so I am still grieving, but the tiredness was the worst side effect and I still have it but I am hoping that it will go away the longer I take it. Only reason I didn&#039;t rate it so high is because I haven&#039;t been on it too long."
