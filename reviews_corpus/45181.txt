"I&#039;ve been on Prozac only for a week now but I&#039;ve noticed a big change in my sleeping schedule and headaches...they&#039;ve gotten so much worse!!! Can&#039;t think straight anymore and my head&#039;s always pounding. My review on this drug will change if i begin to see positive effects, but as of now, I&#039;m ready to ask my psychiatrist for a new drug!"
