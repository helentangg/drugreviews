"I&#039;ve been diagnosed with moderate depression in December. I&#039;ve been in therapy with a psychologist since October. I lost my job, didn&#039;t go to school, broke up with my boyfriend, I was pretty much a mess. I had no motivation whatsoever. I basically secluded myself. I started Celexa 3 weeks ago and WOW oh WOW. I feel so happy. People noticed that I&#039;ve changed and seriously the first week on Celexa was hard but it&#039;s so worth it. Stick with it, give it a chance. The only problem I have with Celexa is that it takes me forever to achieve orgasm but whatever I still have a sex drive which is very good. I got my boyfriend back, yay. Now I&#039;m back to school, found a new job. I mean I got my life back on track and I am so happy with the results."
