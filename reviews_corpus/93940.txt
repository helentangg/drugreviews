"This is the ONLY antidepressant that has A) worked for me and B) not caused weight gain. Yes, its expensive. Yes, it causes horrible nausea for the first few weeks.  I&#039;ve been on it for several months now, and unfortunately I still get slightly nauseous every morning when I take (with or without food).  But its been completely worth it for me. My depression no longer controls my life or causes me to miss work or school. 

My advice: try it if you can afford it. Soldier through the initial week or so of nausea. Give it a chance and it might just be your miracle drug - it was for me. Mild nausea for 20 minutes every morning is a small price to pay for an antidepressant that truly works. 9/10 only due to price and nausea."
