"I&#039;m taking the time to comment on this drug because I have found a lot of negative horror stories about Lexapro. I know that everyone handles medication differently, however I can tell you from my experience this medication is a life saver. I was on 40mg for 4 years, off for 1 year and am back on 20mg. I hemmed and hawed about getting back on. I&#039;m not sorry I did, my depression lifted and my horrible obsessive thoughts are now NOT taking over my life. I give this a 9 because it helps, but is hard to come off of, even weaning the proper way. All in all though it has made all the difference in bringing me out of my slump."
