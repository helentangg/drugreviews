"A miracle pill! I am 23 years old &amp; I had anxiety since childhood. It exceeded to an extent that I was unable to carry out my daily routine. I visited my therapist and he prescribed me this pill. I was reluctant to take it at first. 1st week was so bad! I could not function well because of nausea &amp; drowsiness. Into the 2nd and 3rd week, drowsiness and nausea subsided but I was concerned about the sexual side-effects. I had trouble maintaining an erection and I could not orgasm at all. Into the 4th week, I experience no side-effects. My orgasms have returned, and they have returned stronger. I can last significantly longer in bed &amp; most of all, my anxiety levels have dropped down to almost non-existent levels. I&#039;m currently in the 5th week."
