"More energy. Better, deeper sleep, no more stomach problems. Haven&#039;t felt better in years. I would have started this med a long time ago if I went to the doc sooner. Only downfall is the side effects when first starting them. I also get bad side effects after I get sick with the flu almost as though I&#039;m starting taking them for the first time again. All in all I would recommend this to all that ask I am afraid of getting off of the meds from what I&#039;ve read on the internet though."
