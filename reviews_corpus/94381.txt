"started on 10mg for 1 month had nausea and dry mouth, but nausea started to go away, still having depression and some anxiety. then doc went up to 20mg. I been on 20mg for almost two weeks. I been having nausea all day, severe acid reflux, severe indigestion and really bad upset stomach. not sure if this is related but if it is, I cant wait to stop this medicine."
