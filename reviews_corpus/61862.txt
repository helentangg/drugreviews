"My &quot;episode&quot; started when my marriage was falling apart. I thought I was handling it well until I just started crying uncontrollably. I was prescribed a number of antidepressants none of which worked. Then about 6 years ago I started on Celexa. I had no side effects and it has worked perfectly for me. I just increased to 40 mg due to some extremely challenging changes in my life. Again I have had no side effects; I am in control of my emotions and not feeling over medicated. This has been a godsend for me and I am comfortable telling people about it."
