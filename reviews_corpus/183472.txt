"I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia two weeks ago. I took 30 mg for 1 week and just went to 60 mg. I am losing weight and not hungry on Cymbalta. The nausea wore off after a few days.  I am incredibly tired and want to rest all day until about 2-3 hours before I take it again right before bed at 9 pm.  I am hoping this side effect will ease and plan to ask my doctor if going back to a lower dose may help so I can go back to work.  Love it except for the fatigue."
