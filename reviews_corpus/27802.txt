"Lexapro has changed my life for the better.  When I was in my early 20&#039;s, I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety and depression.  I took Lexapro for about 15 years until recently weaning off of it because I was feeling great.  That was a mistake.  Three months after weaning, I started to suffer from severe anxiety and depression, and now have starting taking Lexapro again with the help of a therapist and my doctor who specializes in stress management.  The day I went back on Lexapro, I started to feel better.  I have been able to sleep and focus on my job and my life has improved greatly.  I am convinced that going back on Lexapro saved my marriage and my relationship with my 2 1/2 year old son."
