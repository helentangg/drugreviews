"I was put on Celexa for Depression, Bipolar as well as my OCD (Onsessive Compulsive Disorder). I start off taking 10mg and then later upgraded to 20mg but my experience wasn&#039;t entirely the greatest. The Celexa aggravated my OCD ticks making them occur more frequently which automatically raised my level of anxiety and stress. I am always tired and feel like a complete zombie, I find it tiring to even laugh and smile. My appetite has increased drastically, I pretty much never stop eating. And it has really affected my bipolar making me very irritable. Ever since I&#039;ve been on Celexa I&#039;ve had many child-like tantrums where I have gotten physically violent. This pill wasn&#039;t for me. I am currently still on Celexa but am being weened off of it."
