"I started on 10mg for acute myofascial pain and bursitis in both hips it absolutely changed my life,  Almost all pain has stopped unless I exacerbate the bursitis with a 10 mile walk !  After about 4 years I had to increase the dossage to 20mg as I was beginning to notice I was experiencing pain again but the increased dosage has rendered me almost pain free again.  I could not cope now without it although I do worry about being so reliant on drugs for pain relief the side affects are negligible as I take dose before bedtime so do not experience undue fatigue."
