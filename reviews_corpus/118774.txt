"After working with a therapist for 4 months to overcome my panic disorder and obsessional thoughts, I realized I needed some extra help.  I began to take Zoloft, first at 25 mg to ease into the symptoms, and later increased to 50.  I began to notice relief from symptoms after about 2 weeks of taking the medication.  I still have bothersome thoughts that circle in and out through my mind during the day, but the nausea and the heart pounding that comes with the thoughts does not happen anymore. I am able to recognize my symptoms as those of panic disorder and can move forward feeling positive.  The only side effects I experienced were headache and nausea the first few days. I am going to continue therapy and hopefully one day overcome this."
