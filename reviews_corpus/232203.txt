"I&#039;m 21 years of age and up to now, I&#039;ve been taking 20 mg for the past 9 months. Since I was 16 or so I&#039;ve suffered from, at least in the beginning what some may call &#039;smiling&#039; depression, and what followed was chronic depression in my 20s. At 17-18 years of age I  participated in cognitive behavioural therapy (coping mechanisms). 
I suffered frequent panic / anxiety attacks, suicidal thoughts, etc.
19-21 went to college. Chronic depression hit hard and they put me on 20 mg Paxil. I have never felt better in my life. Usually it is difficult to realise when one is in such a state, and now that I can see things &quot;clearly&quot;, I&#039;ve excelled in school and in other social conditions. 
In Europe, the Gov&#039;t produces Paxil without a brand name. Cheap."
