"I&#039;m 18 and a first time user for depression medicines. I was just given 50mg of this to start out and so far it has helped a lot and it&#039;s only been three days. I haven&#039;t had any energy for a month and just wanted to sleep all the time but now I&#039;m doing things like cleaning and going out! The only problem is it makes me sick and I&#039;ve had headaches, dilated pupils and sleep problems but it is worth it and I&#039;m sure it&#039;ll get better as the days go by."
