"I took 200 mg of amitriptyline for 40&#039;years for clinical depression.. I decided to find a safer medication with fewer side effects. I started Effexor and was weaned off amitriptyline at same time. Within 2 days my depression lifted,repetitive/unwanted thoughts discontinued. Down to 50 mg of amitriptyline and at 75 mg of Effexor. It&#039;s working amazingly well and amitriptyline withdrawal is minimal"
