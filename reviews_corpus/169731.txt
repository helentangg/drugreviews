"My brother (22) and I (25) both take this for migraines or as my doctor calls ours, tension headaches. It is the greatest medication ever. I was suffering through headaches on a daily basis, and this has put a complete stop to them. It also helps me fall asleep quickly at night and wake rested. LOVE it!"
