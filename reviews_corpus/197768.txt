"I have been on Pritiq for about 2 months now and it has been going pretty good. I will say that I went on a trip and forgot my medication and within the first 2 days I slept 20 hours straight and I had bad mood changes. When I came home I went right back on it and have had no problems since. I have no appetite and have lost about 15 - 20 pounds. It makes me feel much more awake. I am on the lowest dosage and with these results I have no desire to increase my dosage."
