"Okay I have been on celexa for about a week now. I&#039;m currently working 6 days a week 9-10 hour shifts so I&#039;m exhausted as it is. And I feel like I can&#039;t sleep and for the past two days I haven&#039;t been wanting to eat  at all. Is this normal for this medicine. I&#039;m on 20mg once a day?"
