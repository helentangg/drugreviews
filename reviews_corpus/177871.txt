"I have been on Cymbalta 60mg for chronic abdominal pain for 3 years. It has been a life saver for me and dropped my narcotic use (hydrocodone) down to a 30 day prescription lasting me a year.  I did notice earlier this year more pain and with that more of the narcotic need and depression.  My Dr. raised me up to 90mg (one 60mg and a 30mg) and I haven&#039;t had need of the hydrocodone for 3 months.  I&#039;m very satisfied."
