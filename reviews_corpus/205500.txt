"After a severe injury in the workplace, I hit rock bottom, depressed, suicidal, hopeless, really sad.
I didn&#039;t understand what was going on, like someone else was at the wheel and I had to go along on this scary ride.
I needed help so went to a psychiatrist who diagnosed clinical Depression, this was a relief to hear and separated me from the weirdo driving!
Took 2 years of counseling and different medicines to find the right one, for me it is Pristiq. I have been on it for 8 years and now work full time. I think it takes a while for the user to live with an anti-depressant medication, I read and hear of many who want out after 2-4 years, but I found that just hanging in there is the way to go. 
I see myself as complete now, no side effects."
