"I was once you, anxiously reading reviews for Lexapro. I began getting severe anxiety and mild depression and my doctor recommended 10mg of Lexapro. I have never liked taking drugs, but I felt like it was my only choice.
The first 2-3 weeks my experience worsened. Every side effect you could have, I had. Drowsiness, sleep problems, nausea, vomiting, decreased libido, constant yawning, the list goes on. However it started to lighten up every week. By Week 6, every side effect was gone.
11 months later and I&#039;m still on 10mg and I can&#039;t explain how much my life has improved over the past year. My life is back. I&#039;m happier than ever and enjoying every aspect of life again. It may be hard at the start, but it&#039;s worth it. I believe in you! peace"
