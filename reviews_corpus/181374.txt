"I can honestly say that fluoxetine has improved my quality of life to a great extent. I went from feeling extremely depressed on a daily basis, to feeling very happy and content with my life. I am a lot more open and honest with people, I feel like my inhibitions and anxieties (about some things) have been lifted. I am a lot more talkative and chatty, and for some reason enjoy trashy tv more (which I&#039;m not sure is a good thing)! I have had several tattoos since beginning taking this drug (I had none before). I did carefully consider them though. 
The only negative effects to note were that at the start of the treatment I did have insomnia for a while and very intense nightmares."
