"I have been on Zoloft for almost 30 years now and never any higher than 50mg. I was stricken with panic/anxiety disorder in my early 20&#039;s, and now early 50&#039;s, I have never had to go higher. It keeps the attacks at bay, but once in a while, I will get one. I have heard it is hereditary. I do believe this is the case. Both of my siblings struggle with the attacks, and take Zoloft as well. Both of my girls suffer as well. The youngest one, now 23, has just started on Zoloft, 25 mg and she is not sure if it is working just yet. The oldest one is able to keep them at bay without medicines. You lose your sex drive on these medicines. I have confidence on this drug and hope others will also."
