"I was on Zoloft for two years. I started taking it after I had a panic attack due to extreme stress. It worked well for me. I tried Lexapro for a few days maybe 9 to be exact and I couldn&#039;t function. I couldn&#039;t lift my head or have the strength to care for my son who was a baby at the time. Zoloft was amazing. I stayed on 50mg and felt normal again. But with that said, I did gain 30 pounds. The medicine makes you feel so relaxed as before I was a calorie counter and obsessed with what I ate. I didn&#039;t mind much because I was better, that&#039;s what mattered. I came off of it and decided to get back on 5 months after stopping. I can say the second time around of being on it doesn&#039;t work for me. Like others, I must have become immune to it."
