"I&#039;ve been on Clonazepam for about 3-4 years and it worked for me but it put a severe damper on my libido. My doctor recommeded Pristiq, so I started the weaning of the Clonazepam and began Pristiq. After several weeks I can say there was no effect on my anxiety, thanks to the doctor for perscribing Ativan as a backup. One thing I can say for the Pristiq is it seemed to correct my irritable bowel syndrome. The doc said that the IBS is probably a side affect of the anxiety and the Pristiq stopped that. After reading what people posted about irregularity and the fact that my anxiety remained, I would have to attribute the results to a side effect rather than a sign of improvment. I&#039;m now taking Cipralex for a week with better results."
