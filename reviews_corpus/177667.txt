"I have GAD, tried celexa, worked for a while, mental fog. I then tried Lexapro which worked but I decided to try Cymbalta for its chronic low back pain effectiveness. I have a bulged disc, arthritis from homecare for many years. I will not even consider Narcotics for pain... Cymbalta has been a life saver, I too have dry mouth night sweats, increased weight of 10lbs. But I feel calmer, I started off on 30 mg for 2 wks the increased the dose per my HCP.  I can tell when I don&#039;t take it. Chronic low back pain, dizziness as well and  anxiety symptoms return... I am a nurse and I hate taking medicine but this is one medicine I don&#039;t mind taking. The benefits out weigh the everything else."
