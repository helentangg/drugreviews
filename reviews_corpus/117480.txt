"Being treated for vestibular migraines.  I was very worried about taking this (side affects) so I waited a week before deciding to try it.  Only took 10mg at night.  I could not get to sleep and in the morning I experienced sadness, anxiety, increased heart rate, irritability, dizziness, brain fog. One time was enough I have a family and can&#039;t ride these symptoms out ( if they ever actually would decrease). The negative effects out weighed any benefits."
