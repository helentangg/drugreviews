"I started it and noticed I slept well after first tablet. The 10mg works better for fibromyalgia on low dose apparently (10mg) but anyway I took it daily an hour or two before bed but it did take a good 4 months to get into my system and work on blocking out most of my pain and actually get to grips with my own personal experiences with this chronic condition.  It worked really well on my migraines I  get them occasionally if I eat food triggers wheat - dairy - msg amongst other triggers  but not nearly as bad as before I started taking amitriptyline. I can honestly say its given me back my life and can plan ahead which I have never been able to do before.  I gave it a   10/10.  My side effects were dry mouth for few weeks and I watch my diet because it can increase your appetite"
