"My migraines started from caffeine excess and a pour diet. After suffering daily migraine attacks for two months I tried the following without success: Fioricet, Taylenol , Depakote, Naproxen and Fluoxetine. Then I tried Amitriptyline 25 mg with a complete stop of the pain (I am so happy, I found it). I have been on it for 2 weeks with success. I don&#039;t really want to increment to 50 mg because it made me sluggish the next day. Overall it&#039;s been a miracle for me. Really cheap, I suggest you try. Good Luck."
