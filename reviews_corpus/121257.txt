"In 1997 I was involved in a MV wreck which cost me 6 years of no memory of my life, not able to return to my Director&#039;s position with a major railroad company.  I have been on Effexor XR 225mg (now Venlafaxine XR 225mg) since then.  This has been the worst journey of my life.  I am now 71 years of age and will be on it for the rest of my life.  I suffered severe head trauma in 1997, two breakdowns and memory loss.  If I don&#039;t take this medicine I am in a great deal of head pain, vertigo and many other symptoms.  I decided not to try to get off of it anymore."
