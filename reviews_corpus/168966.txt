"I was taking Celexa 40mg every night but it seemed to just stop working one day so my psychiatrist put me on Viibryd. Usually I have constipation but it&#039;s helped my bowels move better. I do have some trouble sleeping because right as I&#039;m about to fall asleep I get weird spasms throughout my body almost like I&#039;m being shocked? Then once I do fall asleep I have strange scary nightmares and sometimes lucid dreams, so when I wake up I&#039;m not sure if what happened was real or not. I also have some trouble waking up but once I am up I feel alright. I&#039;m rating this a 7 because I don&#039;t have any problems with my depression anymore. It does cause me to take some Xanax at times but I&#039;ve only been on it for 3 weeks."
