"I am on my fourth week of taking 40 mg viibryd and it seems to be working well.  I had very few side effects.  However, I am noticing severe hair loss on my frontal hairline.  I still want to continue taking Viibryd because it works well for me.  Anyone else having the same problem with hair loss?  If so, did you discontinue taking Viibryd or did you do something that alleviated the problem?"
