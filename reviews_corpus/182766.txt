"I&#039;ve been on 6 different meds now for depression. Truthfully, night before last, I almost voluntarily committed myself to psych. I couldn&#039;t take it anymore. After talking to my husband and my best friend, I decided not to go to the ER, but instead make an urgent next day appointment. 

I am I glad I did!!! 

I took dose #1(30 mg) at 3 pm. No zombie feeling. No brain fog. I mean, I could definitely feel I took something, but completely unlike any other med. Side effects, extremely nauseous, a little sweaty, giggly. 

Along with my SEVERE depression, I have multiple autoimmune diseases, PTSD, crippling anxiety, and chronic nerve/joint pain. I have not noticed decrease in pain yet, but wasn&#039;t expecting to after a single dose."
