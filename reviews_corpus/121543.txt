"Great feeling so far. Been on it almost two weeks for anxiety. Other than feeling a little jittery, it&#039;s been the best experience on meds thus far. I started being treated for major depression and was put on celexa which had horrible side effects and eventually stopped working. Then came Lexapro which was considerably better but I gained 45 lbs while taking it and had very low energy. Effexor makes me feel like I have energy again! So far, I&#039;m in love."
