"I went on Cymbalta for my fibromyalgia pain and depression.  I never had any real early side effects like nausea or vomiting, but I have gained 15 pounds. My meds have helped me and I  don&#039;t suffer from as many days of dreading to get out of bed. Cymbalta has helped me greatly and if some extra weight is the price I have to pay to be happy then I can deal with that."
