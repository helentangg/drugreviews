"Had been taking Zoloft 50mg about a year, then when my life stress increased, it wasn&#039;t helping me cope well. Im also taking Generic Adderal 10mg 2x daily which helps more with mood, focus, and anxiety. Since generic effexor is working so well for my daughter, I had asked my Psychiatrist if I could try it. From day one it seemed like a miracle and for about half a year I felt pretty normal. Doc thought 75mg dose was too low, but once I went up in dose. I started the downward spiral of side effects. On day 3 now, taking zoloft 50mg again, per the doc, but feel horrible, physically and ever so crazy now and then. I&#039;m older female and sure don&#039;t need this. Wouldn&#039;t suggest this med to anyone over 30 because it&#039;s so nasty to change from."
