"I started this med in September of 2015.  I have been on 30 psychotropic medications over the past twenty years to manage my MDD and anxiety.  Had 30-ish ECT treatments as well.  Also have regular CBT therapy.  Nothing was working for more than a couple of months.

However I started Trintellix and saw improvement within a month.  After a decade of a depressive episode that I never got into remission from, I was in partial remission.  No, it isn&#039;t complete remission but I&#039;ve dealt with the fact that that may not be in the cards for me.  

I haven&#039;t had active suicidal thoughts in a year.  Until that point, I hadn&#039;t gone without suicidal thoughts for more than a month.  

This drug has been a life saver for me.  No side effects."
