"I started taking paroxetine 10 mg a couple weeks for premenopause symptoms of anxieties depression. First week was hard i had bad headaches and feeling foggy side effects ugh.. the Pharmacy told me start with half a pill until my body adjusted. I gave it a week. I went back on the full pill and I am doing good. I notice a difference I feel more my self.  I am grateful I don&#039;t know what I&#039;d do without it."
