"In 1995, I was miserable for no particular reason and was diagnosed with depression and prescribed Prozac.  Great life, depression in check.  In 2013, I weened myself off it because I  didn&#039;t think I needed it anymore.  As luck would have it,  I hit a period of  challenging events in life that they brain  interpreted as trauma.  To cope, I began drinking a little which evolved into daily. I concluded that I had gone off Prozac, decreased self control and created a personal crisis.  I&#039;m back on Prozac and my moods have leveled off and I so far have the ability to abstain.  I won&#039;t go off it again."
