"Absolutely the worst medicine I have ever been on. I&#039;ve been on antidepressants for years and they all suppressed my emotions. I was on trazodone for depression/chronic insomnia but unfortunately the medicine quit working for me so my doctor prescribed me amitriptyline 25mg and when I tell you every single horrible emotion was brought forward, I&#039;m not even lying. Everyone around me noticed a difference and I felt trapped but was expressing externally. I had a psychotic break on this medication however I was not suocidal. If I had the power to take this medicine off the market, I&#039;m sorry I would. The range of emotions I had was sadness to anger to agitation and it was on a repeat cycle and I couldn&#039;t control it no matter how much I wanted to"
