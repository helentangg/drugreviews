"I&#039;m 29, female, was on Celexa before. On 50mg of medicine for past 2 weeks. Killed my sex drive stone cold-just gone! Palpitations like crazy. Extreme nausea and dizziness. Sweating through my clothes...under arms, chest, back, groin, everywhere! My whole body is very tense and my TMJ is flaring like crazy. Feel like a sweaty zombie with palpitations and zero sex drive. Trying to stick with it. "
