"Taking it since one month because of a reactive depression for over a year. I have never taken anti-depressants before and kept refusing although my psychologist urged me to for several months. When the depression kept getting darker: no energy, sad, bad insomnia and constant thoughts of suicide (which my psychologist didn&#039;t know) I decided to take the advise to start on brintellix (was either that or kill myself). The first 4 days I was so tired I spent most of the time in bed . Then I just started to feel better and better. High energy level, creative, not sad, no mood swings, slept great at night and best of all the suicidal thoughts just disappeared . I started and stayed on 5 mg. No side effects at all, working night shift no problem!"
