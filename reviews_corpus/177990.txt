"I started on 30mg a day for a month for fibromyalgia and had moderate pain relief along with and some mild side effects that faded after a few weeks (mostly trouble staying asleep). Then I bumped up to 60mg and it was extremely helpful with reducing my pain!! I was able to do things with energy and not crash so much at night! However, I&#039;m apparently one of the unlucky few who get really bad psychological effects from it. After 3 months of denying the increasing depression, I ended up being hospitalized for wanting to kill myself. Fortunately the psychiatrist who treated me recognized the importance of pain management and he has me on 30mg of Cymbalta again with an added dose of Lamictal (mood stabilizer) to combat the crazy. It helps."
