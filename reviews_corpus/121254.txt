"If I could give this drug a minus ... I would. The reasons are simple: 

- It has mild effects when it comes down to relieving anxiety 
- It has profound effects on my sexual function 
- It is extremely effective at giving me hell when trying to get off it 
- It could be used as an effective drug used to induce vomiting 

This drug is truly deplorable in every sense and should not be fit for consumption by human beings."
