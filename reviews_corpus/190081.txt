"I have spent years going through one anti-depressant after another.  I even did ECT treatments and nothing worked.  My psychiatrist then put me on desipramine and I have never looked back.  I have energy, I can concentrate, get out of bed, and function for the first time in years.  I&#039;ve been taking it for 6 months now and have not had to increase the dosage, either.  It was truly a godsend."
