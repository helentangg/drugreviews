"I&#039;ve tried three other anti-depressants, and this is the only one that actually works and the only one that didn&#039;t give me horrible side effects. Ladies, it also helps PMDD!  I hadn&#039;t known that it would treat so many of my other problems.  Asking my doctor to write me a prescription for this was the best idea I&#039;ve had in years and I don&#039;t know why no other doctor gave me this before. Good luck finding your best antidepressant."
