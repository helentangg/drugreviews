"So far this drug has saved my life. After experiencing a traumatic experience I spiralled into a heavy depression coupled with anxiety. It&#039;s only been one week and I&#039;m no longer crying daily and the hopeless feeling is subsiding. It&#039;s also helped stopped the obsessive thoughts I&#039;ve been having about the traumatic event."
