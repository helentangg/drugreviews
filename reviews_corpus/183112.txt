"I was prescribed Cymbalta for anxiety but I have noticed that my osteoarthritis is so much better. I can get out of bed in the morning without hobbling around trying to get my joints working.I can also get up from my chair at work without pain.I am amazed at how much better I feel. Oh &amp; it takes care of my anxiety as well."
