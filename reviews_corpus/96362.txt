"Finally, after being reduced from 100mg to 75 mg to 50 mg, it was working great. Then on 50mg I started getting dizzy spells that lasted a week. They just came out of the blue.  Went to the gym in winter and was getting dizzy after workout. Lowered to 25 mg...was still working and no dizzy spells but I was still having mind body functioning problems. My doctor switched me to Prozac. It is not helping the depression and 5mg makes me nervous and is not lifting the depression so back to the doctor to get put back on 25mg of Zoloft. I hope the 25mg starts to make me feel better. Yes, I fear if dosage is increased to 50mg the week long dizzy spells will come back. 50mg Zoloft was working so well."
