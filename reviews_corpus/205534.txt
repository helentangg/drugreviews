"After suffering from mild depression and anxiety, I was much anticipated to use this medicine to help me. I have to date been on this medicine for close to 5 weeks, and I can say the first two-three weeks may have been hard to get through, but I managed, and I can happily say; this may be the best medicine on the market for fighting/ combating depression! I can&#039;t remember the last I have felt like this! Thank you Pristiq for bringing me back to what I used to be!"
