"I have had chronic pain since I was about 11 yrs old, I&#039;m 43 now, due to a genetic blood disease. It&#039;s caused arthritis that&#039;s led to neuropathy, spine degeneration, and many damaged joints. 

I have been taking toradol and gabapentin for nerve pain for almost 3 years. Recently a bleed in my feet caused extensive nerve damage that would make my feet burn at night. My doctor added 50 mg of Elavil to my bedtime meds and after 6 weeks I notice a significant improvement. It has been 3 months and 90% of my foot pain and numbness is gone. I have also noticed an overall improvement in my face pain and back pain.

I am lucky enough to not have any notable side effects."
