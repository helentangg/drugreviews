"previously been treated for anxiety &amp; low with citalopram, I did feel better after 2 years, reduced &amp; came off.
After 6 months I started to feel low again, irritable, unable to concentrate, terrible sleep patterns, abusing alcohol &amp; pain killers, night sedation &amp; phenergan!
I was depressed!
Tried sertraline 50 mg od initially &amp; felt worse! But gradually my mood lifted! After about 2 weeks my mood was definitely better however the anxiety took much longer! It&#039;s been about 8 weeks now &amp; I feel great.
Taking 100mg sertraline od &amp; it&#039;s fab!
My advice is stick with it, if you initially feel rough it will pass xxxxx"
