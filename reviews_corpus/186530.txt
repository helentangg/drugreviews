"I suffer from Dysthymic Depression and had been on Prozac until it stopped working and I started having suicidal thoughts. I&#039;ve been on Pristiq for 3 months and it has changed my life for the better. I take it in the morning so I sleep at night. I am no longer tired. I have tons of energy and have a zest for living again. I have dropped 12 lbs and it does not affect my energy levels for running, biking and weight training. I can focus better at work and my sex drive has returned after being dulled for the past 7 years. My husband is thrilled. This drug has been a positive step for me."
