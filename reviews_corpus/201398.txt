"Been on it for 3 months.  At first it was worse. The panick attacks and anxiety. Then it was like my brain flipped the switch. I feel so much better. Im 30 and started getting anxiety at 22. I never wanted meds.  Fought hard and tried everything natural.  Finally I gave in.  I&#039;m so happy now. I am not afraid of my own shadow anymore.  I think I may have put on 3lbs from it, but as long as it stops there.  Or it could be all the cookies. Give it a try.  I&#039;m not cured, but I NEVER want to go off Zoloft."
