"I have been taking sertraline 50mg for the past 4 months or so. At first I utterly hated the medication. Half an hour after I took my first dose, I had the worst panic attack of my life. I started to cry, I was shaking, my BPM sky rocketed, &amp; I wanted to die. I also completely lost my appetite, in the first two weeks I lost about 6-7 pounds, &amp; I am small to start. Eating became a chore. I kept reading this drug was successful when you stuck with it. My appetite eventually came back, but I still needed the edge off. Went to my psychiatrist, he added Propanonol 10mg 2x/day &amp; I feel so good now all the time. My depression is gone it seems, my aniexty has drastically faded, &amp; my self confidence is restored. It was a rough start, but worth it."
