"I&#039;ve been taking Pristiq for about 2 weeks now.  I feel a lot better.  I have had increased energy, and a great mood during the day.  My doctor told me I would start to feel the affects in about a week or so, but I felt them immediately.  I have also lost 13 lbs.  I have had a few side effects though.  Namely, muscle cramps, and diarrhea, but I believe these will, pass.  I am going to stick it out.  I have also been taking the medicine in the mornings to avoid problems sleeping."
