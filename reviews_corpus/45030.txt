"Prozac (10mg) worked great for my depressive symptoms- I had energy and was motivated.  I had no issues with weight gain or my sex drive. It did however, significantly increase my anxiety- I had scary obsessive, intrusive thoughts, along with bad episodes of panic that came out of nowhere.  I was scared to drive, go over bridges- there was always this fear of &quot;what if?&quot;  Everything that I could be anxious about, I was.  I had a very difficult time quieting my mind, and at times I thought i was going crazy.  Very scary experience overall.  For those suffering from depression, Im sure this RX is a God-send, but much too &quot;speedy&quot; for my body."
