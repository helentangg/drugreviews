"I don&#039;t understand why people quit after 3 days starting it. It made them too anxious or depressed - isn&#039;t this why you are taking it? It doesn&#039;t work overnight. I too am very impatient and would prefer a quick fix. But the first 2 weeks are rough but if your persevere the benefits outweigh the startup. I&#039;m into my 3rd week and it&#039;s working really well it is like a lightbulb moment.  I gave a 9 because for the life of me I cannot orgasm but I&#039;ll take that over the suicidal thoughts and feeling lifeless anyday... remember give it time your brain needs to adjust... stay strong x"
