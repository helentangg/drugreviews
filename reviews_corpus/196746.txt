"I was suffering from severe hot flashes ever 35-40min all day, severe day AND night sweats, chills, feeling hot &amp; cold at the same time, I was extremely miserable.  I could not go to work, my social and love-life came to an abrupt end.  I would get soaking wet and had to remove all clothing every 35-40mins.  IT WAS HORRIBLE!  This went on for 3 months.  Everyone kept telling me it was not going to last long, maybe just a few YEARS.  In no way was I going to go for years feeling that way.  My doctor prescribe Brisdelle 7.5mg 7 weeks ago and my life is 90% back to normal. Once I started taking this medication, the sweats, chills, and severity of the flashes stopped.  I only have mild flashes and hopefully they will end. too."
