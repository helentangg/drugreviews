"I&#039;ve been on and off this medication for about 12 years now for my autonomic disorder, and it&#039;s been wonderful for me! I don&#039;t have a good reaction to Paxil, but Zoloft has worked great. I&#039;m much less anxious, my symptoms have subsided, and I&#039;ve even been able to come down on my dose recently. I don&#039;t recommend just coming off of it without talking to your doctor, because you can have some nasty side effects with that, and be warned that it takes between 15-30 days to fully take effect, so you have to be patient, but the results are great with little to no side effects!"
