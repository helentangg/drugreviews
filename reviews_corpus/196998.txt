"Been on Brisdelle for ten days.  I was having eight to ten hot flashes a day and I was up all night long with them as well.  Over the last ten days they have tapered off, with yesterday and today being completely hot flash free!   My anxiety is also almost completely gone.  I had bouts of nausea in the beginning that came in waves and even woke me up at night, but that seems to have disappeared completely.  I hope this continues!  I&#039;m very happy with this medication."
