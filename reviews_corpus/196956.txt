"Was prescribed this at around 16-17 yrs old, for social and generalized anxiety. It did work well, but the excessive sweating and my father&#039;s anti-med nagging made me try and quit. I had only been taking it for like 5 months and I felt like I&#039;d been addicted for years. Brain zaps, constant lethargy, extreme and unwarranted moods; these symptoms lasted an entire month, despite my short usage time. 

I&#039;m upset that this was the first thing they tried, on a 17 yr old complaining about social anxiety and the occasional panic attack... That month was the worst I&#039;ve ever felt, if I wasn&#039;t a teen without responsibilities or took it for longer, I don&#039;t think I could&#039;ve ever gotten off of it.
