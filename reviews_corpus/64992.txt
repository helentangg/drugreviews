"I am actually just starting Zoloft for very consistent anxiety and probably depression that I am unaware of but I&#039;m sure its there.  I have tried propranol which will masque my anxiety but always seems to come back.  Now I am waking up in the middle of the night with ringing ears and high heart rate.  The Dr. has run about every test in the world and can&#039;t find anything wrong with me.  I just want to feel normal and live a healthy life.  I have heard the first two weeks can be rough with increased anxiety but I need to give it a shot.  

Hope to have good feedback soon."
