"I have been taking Celexa 20mg for about 3 months for social anxiety disorder and it&#039;s worked great so far.  I am much more talkative and social around people.  I don&#039;t get shaky and don&#039;t dread meeting new people anymore. Someone at my last party asked me if I was high at a party when I hadn&#039;t been drinking or anything.  He said usually I am sitting in the corner being anti-social.  I had a touch of nausea when I changed from 10-20 mg, but other than that I do sleep deeper and I think I have less nervous energy than I used to.  I was also yawning uncontrollably for the first month, but I am much more happier."
