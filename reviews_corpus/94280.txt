"I have been on Brintellix for about 3 weeks now due to depression and anxiety. I have noticed increased energy, some nausea &amp; headaches (usually on an empty stomach), some loss of sleep, and nightmares. The worst of the nausea and headaches lasted for about the first 4 days and was infrequent usually for about 90 minutes after taking the pill (I take it at night now before bed).  Impressive improvement in the large emotional mood swings and anxiety I was experiencing was quick.  I have never taken anything before.  Brintellix has improved my symptoms and quality of life.  The benefits definitely outweigh any side effects I have experienced."
