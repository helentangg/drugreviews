"This is update to my original comment in late January earlier this year.  Still taking 20 mg daily.  Still feeling great.  Been on 6 months.  Its really amazing.  Sadness (depression) completely gone.  General anxiety gone.  When situational stress occurs it feels lesser and tolerable.  The truth is the medicine blocks emotional or physcological pain.  It probably blocks super emotional highs also but its an easy trade.  Side effects are appetite increase (because you are happy and not anxious) occasional night sweats sleeping, delayed orgasm but good if you had premature orgasm issue.  This med is wonderful and no need to suffer emotional pain forever.  Live happy today."
