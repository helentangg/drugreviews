"I told myself I&#039;d come back and write a review if I liked Effexor, because people tend to only write reviews if they don&#039;t like it, and that&#039;s scary for someone who is trying to figure out whether to try it or not. This was the first medication I&#039;ve tried to treat my chronic GAD. Before Effexor, I was living in a state of constant panic and anxiety. It was really awful, and I felt like I couldn&#039;t continue much longer without completely breaking down. I&#039;m now 3 months in, and it has helped so much. I am still myself and I have anxious thoughts, but there is no longer that sense of panic and overwhelming fear. I feel like I did pre-anxiety and its wonderful. Everyone reacts differently, but have hope! Medication can work!"
