"I have had OCD and anxiety for 26 years, Prozac worked for about 7 yrs. Then pooped out, Zoloft was next.  It lasted another 7 yrs then pooped out. Then came Lexapro and I only got 2 yrs out of it and then had my first major depressive episode.  Lasted 9 mnths while Dr. was trying Effexor XR.  It helped the depression, but not the OCD.  Went to a new Dr. and was put on Viibryd starter pack and when I was up to 40 mgs. I had my life back. Recently, my doc upped the dosage to 60 mgs. because I was still obsessing about getting the depression back.  Been on the 60 mg. dose for a few days and it actually made my OCD and anxiety worse, however, when I called the Dr., he said that is normal when switching dosages and will go away."
