"I have taken lexapro 10mg for 5 years now.  I recently tried to come off of lexapro due to sexual side effects and had really bad withdrawl symptoms.  I am back on lexapro 5mg and will not try to change for a LONG time.  This medicine keeps me level and keeps me from crying all the time for no reason."
