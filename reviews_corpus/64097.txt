"Having suffered with severe depression &amp; anxiety most of my life, I finally decided to get some help (9 years ago). I was given a string of different tablets to try, persevered with each of them but they didn&#039;t suit me. I was put on sertraline. After an initial adjustment period, it&#039;s been fantastic. The only down side is that I can rarely climax, but that&#039;s a small price to pay to be normal(ish). It extremely noticeable how good the tablets are when I accidentally forgot to order my prescription &amp; have a week without them. By the end of the week I&#039;m a complete, suicidal wreck! I&#039;m going through a rough path &amp; have just doubled my dose. I&#039;m currently experiencing some awful side effects. But I will stick with it as I know it&#039;ll be worth it."
