"Today is only my first day, and I have to say I got really angry with something that happened at work and normally I can shrug this off, but it&#039;s like I couldn&#039;t control it, and was super quite that morning then through the day I felt better. I&#039;ve had headaches and bad diarrhea. The headache happened before the medicine so I&#039;m not sure it&#039;s related and very slight nausea. I&#039;ll blog again once a little more time has passed."
