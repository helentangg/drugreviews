"I have had social anxiety, body dysmorphic disorder, anorexia, generalized anxiety disorder, depression, and obsessive compulsive disorder. You name it, I have had it. Since taking Prozac two months ago, my mood has improved, my thoughts are clearer, I am more motivated about life, like it actually means something. I have no more racing negative thoughts, I am positive, confident, and enjoying life again! Mild side effects include dry mouth, drowsiness, wanting to sleep more, and mild sexual dysfunction."
