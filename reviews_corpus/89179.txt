"I lived with anxiety/depression for years. Everyday felt like a struggle. I experienced a period of intense stress during grad school in my early 30&#039;s, and decided to seek help. If I only did this in my 20&#039;s I could have accomplished so much more. Celexa took away my anxiety and depression, but it took a couple months to work on 20mg. I felt like myself, I felt happy. I had no side effect, no weight gain, nothing. Since I felt so great I attempted to taper down and had bad withdrawal. I decided to stay on it. My 20mg stopped working after two years so I got up to 30mg...I think it &quot;pooped out&quot;. I have bad depression now- sleeping all the time and anxious. I was switched to an SNRI, but celexa changed my life and I&#039;m glad I tried it first."
