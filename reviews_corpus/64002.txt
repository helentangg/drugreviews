"Back in 2013 I started having terrible panic attacks in public. I was agoraphobic with in weeks. Started taking Zoloft in Nov 2016. This month as of May 2017 I have been able to go places by my self that I have not been able to since 2013! It&#039;s the most amazing feeling to be able to go out again anxiety free. I think you should give the medicine longer than 4 months. At 4 months I felt good but couldn&#039;t go out by my self or go to far from home . I&#039;m on 100mg a day. I had extreme fear of medicine wish I would have seen my doctor sooner. I couldn&#039;t even imagine doing what I&#039;m doing now. My life seemed over after 3 years of basically being house bound. When I did go out it was hell. The side effects were not bad at all I have none now."
