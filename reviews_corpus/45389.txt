"In mid June I will have been on Prozac for a year. It helps me think before I act but I think that It makes me overthink, which can be good or bad. I noticed I&#039;m really irritable and extremely tired no matter how much I sleep. This doesn&#039;t help me 100% but I have been controlling myself better. I am not myself. This grouchy, lazy, overreacting person is not me. I go through the school day and then I have no more motivation. I&#039;m just going through the motions."
