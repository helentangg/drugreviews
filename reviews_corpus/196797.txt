"Was on Paxil for 4 years because I could never handle the withdrawal symptoms. I had severe aches and electric shocks along with all flu symptoms. I finally slowly tapered off over 3 months with the liquid Paxil.
I have been off of it now for at least 10 years. I have tried at least 100 different supplements and anti anxiety treatments.....I have tried them all...believe me.....it is hell on earth when you can&#039;t provide for your family. 
I even spent $4000 having all my mercury fillings removed. I had genetic testing of SNP polymorphism&#039;s that revealed MTHFR and MAO mutations.
I found a genetic reason for my anxiety. In short I can&#039;t make neurotransmitters and when I do I can&#039;t break them down so they build up causing social anxiety."
