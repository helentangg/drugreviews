"Ok so I&#039;m a 18 year old girl and I stret taking Zoloft/sertraline at 200 mg about two years ago when I was in a psych hospital for suicide attempts and ptsd from a near death asthma attack. My parents think I&#039;m better, but the medicine is making me have absolutely awful thoughts. I quit it cold turkey for about two weeks without telling them and I felt so much relief. They then found out and I was put back on. I am afraid of myself and my thoughts when I&#039;m on this and I need to get off NOW."
