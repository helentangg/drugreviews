"I rate Paxil as a 10.  It worked almost immediately with me to relieve my symptoms and the only side effect is that it makes me sleepy/tired, which isn&#039;t a problem to me as I am retired (my doctor suggested that I can change the time that I take it, from morning to evening and I am considering doing that, especially if I decide to go back to work again)."
