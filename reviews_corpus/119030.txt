"I&#039;m in my mid-40&#039;s and have been on Zoloft for six years. Anxiety gone...it no longer rules my life. I am able to go out in public and not feel like my world was going to end. Still am subject to turning inward at times..but doesn&#039;t everybody? I do notice some memory issues like really having to think longer about names and places. (Sometimes I feel like a slow computer trying to load a page!) Dosage has been 150mg."
