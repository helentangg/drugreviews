"I have experienced chronic anxiety, panic attacks, and depression for 20+ years. I&#039;ve been on several different medications over the years, but none of them worked entirely. My depression increased over the years, because I believed, nothing could help my problems. I was admitted to a psychiatric unit recently due to suicidal ideations. The attending doctor said he would like to start me on Effexor. I would not allow myself to read the side effects of this medicine, due to my anxiety and the possibility of developing psychosomatic symptoms. Within a week, I began feeling hope, excitement for life, and my anxiety was nearly gone! I&#039;ve been on this medicine now for over a month, and I have never felt this good my entire life! Try this Med!!!"
