"Excellent at first, almost euphoric in the sense of how happy it made me and how little anxiety I had, however I became tolerant to it rather quickly and am now on the max dosage. It still works great for depression but my anxiety has returned. The only side effects I have now are loose stool all the time. For anxiety it worked wonders for the first year but now It only works for depression, will look into another medicine for my anxiety to use in conjunction with this."
