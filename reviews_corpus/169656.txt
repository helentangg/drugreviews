"This medicine made me so exhausted I would sleep at least 12 hours every night and I&#039;d feel so tired all day I couldn&#039;t get anything done. And the two nights I couldn&#039;t take it when I was on it, I stayed up for over 24 hours with insomnia. It freaked me out that it would prevent me from sleeping if I didn&#039;t take it, so I got off of it quickly. It DID help some of the pain, but it wasn&#039;t worth it."
