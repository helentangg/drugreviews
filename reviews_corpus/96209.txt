"After suffering with postnatal depression for 3 years, it spiraled into panic and anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, obsessive compulsive disorder, basically ruling my life. I couldn&#039;t go out of the house, struggled to go to any social events, totally irrational thoughts. I was desperate for help. Having already tried counseling, beta blockers, citalopram and diazepam in the past, I was a bit wary about taking sertraline. Been on them for 4 weeks now and have noticed a huge difference. There were a few side effects such as fatigue, dry mouth and teeth grinding but I am getting out and about again, enjoying my children, haven&#039;t had a panic attack since, generally feeling more positive about life, would definitely recommend these."
