"I started at a 1/4 dose (2.5mg) and couldn&#039;t make it past day 6. I didn&#039;t have the vomiting that others report, but it destroyed my appetite. And then gave me diarrhea. Fastest 5lbs I ever lost. But moreover, it felt like I&#039;d taken a bad amphetamine. It made me INCREDIBLY anxious; heart racing; waking at 5AM in a panic. I&#039;ve taken SSRI&#039;s before--this was something more/different. There were a few glimmers around day 5 when I felt my mood was better (kind of like the kick you get from a cup of coffee) but the rest was unmanageable."
