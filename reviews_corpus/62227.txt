"Update - I am now on day 9, 10 mg a day. I take them first thing in the morning and to be honest have so much energy and have not been eating... I am trying to eat small amounts but to be honest I could do with losing some weight. Started on these weighing 15stone I now weight 14s 8lbs... so that&#039;s good... The symptoms I have had are Jaw clenching, first few days anxiety not as bad but a little.... If I take 20 mg I feel a mess. I felt high whilst walking my dog and then had to turn home as I felt weird.... So for me 10 mg is enough... I am having Counselling as well and CBT. Stick with them I feel so much better than I did 9 days ago, tears, anxious, fed up,no energy.... now I am hopefull. good luck"
