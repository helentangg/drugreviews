"I took this medication for just two days. My doc told me I did not have to wean off of effexor I could just start taking the trintellix on the day I chose.  I became severely depressed.  It hit me like a load of bricks.  Sobbing, feeling helpless, hopelessness and that my life was just not worth living.  I was shocked at how fast these feeling came upon me  I have never experienced something like this before and I have been on several antidepressants over the years.  I also had severe nausea and diarrhea for over 24 hours.  The third day, yesterday I went back to the effexor.  Today I finally feel like myself inside and out.  This medication was NOT for me!"
