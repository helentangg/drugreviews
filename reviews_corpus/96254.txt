"I have general anxiety disorder. I see a therapist weekly. She said I suffer from anxiety and depression. I lost my best friend in Jan and it triggered my anxiety and depression.  I&#039;m a stay a home mom of 2 kids. Daily activities became a hassle and I stress and worry so much now. This past week I&#039;ve noticed a change for the better but I felt I was still battling it. I had bad tension headaches and went to my Dr and he gave me 25 mg to take for a month. I took one almost 2 1/2 hours ago. I started yawning and became tired. I&#039;m laying in bed now and feel awake. So far it seems to be working. I feel calm and not stressed. I&#039;m hoping it works like it has for everyone else."
