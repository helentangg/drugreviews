"I have only been on this med for two days, but OMG what a difference!  I have been in pain mgmt for 25 years for interstitial cystitis and during this time I went from being an energetic, happy person to nothing more than a shell. As the pain and pain med amounts increased, the quality of my so called life decreased to the point that for the last year I do ABSOLUTELY NOTHING but sit on the couch and read. No cooking, no cleaning, no going out, nothing! But after only 2 days, I&#039;m starting to feel like my old self again! Much more energy and have even taken less pain Meds! I haven&#039;t had any side effects. Can&#039;t wait to see how this goes! Sooooo grateful!"
