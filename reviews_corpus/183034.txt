"I took Cymbalta for anxiety and depression. Over the years, I took anywhere from 30-120 mg. I think around 60 mg was most effective with fewest side effects, but I still experienced tons of anxiety while on it. At 120 mg, I had bizarre psychomotor symptoms - for example, in order to fall asleep, I had to rock back and forth. The same day that I decreased from 60 mg to 30 mg, I noticed the return of an OCD-style facial tic I hadn&#039;t had since middle school (I&#039;m 25). Side effects included drastically increased sweating, &quot;brain zap&quot; headaches, and difficulty finding the right words (which may be permanent, as I&#039;ve been off Cymbalta for 3 weeks and continue to experience it)."
