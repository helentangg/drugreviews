"I was put on this medication 50mg nightly to stop migraine/headaches during the day, I have multiple sclerosis and suffer from a lot of neuropathic pain also. I am on Lyrica 300mg twice daily, both of these medications have caused weight gain. I have slowly weaned myself off the endep and now am suffering from dizziness, hoping this will pass. But my concern is that endep is also for treatment of depression, was I being medicated under false pretenses and now that I am off it will suffer from depression. MS is a hard illness to deal with at the best of times, will I now not handle my disease ?? Time will tell."
