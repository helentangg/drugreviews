"Have been on this medication for 4 yrs for Anxiety Disorder &amp; Fibromyalgia. Cymbalta has definitely helped with both conditions. Without it, I&#039;d be in an almost constant state of Anxiety &amp; the Fibromyalgia flare-ups would be much worse. (Found this out when I reduced the dose from 60 mgs a day to 30mgs every other day, after hitting the expensive Medicare &quot;donut hole&quot; last year. That reduction also caused severe depression within a month and I&#039;ve never been diagnosed with depression!). My side effects include some gastrointestinal problems &amp; 30 lb. weight gain, despite daily exercise/diet. (All SSRI&#039;s cause weight gain for me). Hate the extra weight gain, but it&#039;s better than having Anxiety/Fibromyalgia pain."
