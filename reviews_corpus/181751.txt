"I was on 30mg Prozac daily for stress/anxiety/depression after having an eating disorder for 6  years and felt after 1 year I hit a plateau and weaned myself off of it.  When I missed a dose I definitely felt the anxiety creep back and depression set it, but got sick of feeling numb with no emotions and unable to cry even when I wanted to.  I however; after being off of it for a year and trying it again because I know I didn&#039;t gain weight on it which was my biggest fear. I am afraid to try another medicine and frankly don&#039;t feel like going through the weeks you have to wait to see if they work.  I know I liked Prozac in all when I was on it and just hope the plateau I felt is gone.  "
