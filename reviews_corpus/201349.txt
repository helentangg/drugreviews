"I promised myself I&#039;d come back to this site and share my experience since it has helped me so much. About four months ago I had my first panic attack, a week after a very serious surgery, my doctor suggested it was from the anesthesia. Went two weeks without another one, then boom, full blown panic disorder. I thought I was losing my mind, I had to drop out of school and take off work. Went to see a psych who gave me Zoloft, started on 25mg (2weeks) then 50mg where I&#039;m at now. I&#039;ve been at the full dose for 2 months now and I finally feel &quot;that switch&quot; that people talk about go off. The side effects? HORRIBLE. If I didn&#039;t need to stick with it I wouldn&#039;t have. Headaches, insomnia, palpitations, excessive yawning. They go away."
