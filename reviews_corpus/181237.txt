"I began taking Prozac about 10 years ago for generalized anxiety disorder and prescribed my family physician. I took 10 mg for awhile and then increased to about 20mg. 

During this time on Prozac I experienced TMJ which I had never had before. I used to dream of novacaine shots to get rid of the pain. 

I took a break from Prozac and the tmj disappeared. But I never connected the Prozac with tmj. Dr didn&#039;t and dentist didn&#039;t. 

Fast forward to now. Back on Prozac. Back with Tmj. :( 

Loved Prozac. Got rid of my ruminating thoughts and anxiety. I would give it a ten except for the tmj. 

Giving Zoloft a try. Hopefully no tmj."
