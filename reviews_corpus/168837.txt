"Well, started to get panic attacks about 1.5 years ago (after the loss of our first unborn child).  I was put on Paxil (20m) first which worked great but killed sex drive.  Got switched to Viibryd (40m) and stayed on it for about 5-6 months.  Quit because it made me tired all of the time and thought mentally I had figured out how to control the Panic Attacks without meds.  That worked for about 2 months until they came back with a vengeance.  Got back on it and just been taking (20mg), I haven&#039;t lost the weight (50lbs) but haven&#039;t actually made it to the gym to try.  I still feel tired all of the time, coupled with a 10 month old baby girl, but I haven&#039;t had to take any Clonazepam to fight off an attack since I got back on.  Works for me."
