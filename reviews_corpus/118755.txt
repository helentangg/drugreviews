"I&#039;ve been taking Zoloft for 3 days on a doctors recommendation and don`t notice any of the the benefits yet. I have felt a whole bunch of side effects including nausea, loss of appetite, drowsiness and diarrhea. I&#039;ll be seeing the doctor in two days and from what I understand these side effects should decrease over time. "
