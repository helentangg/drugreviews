"The first thing I will say about this medication is that in the first 3-4 weeks you may experience side effects such as nausea, dizziness and/or giddiness. Also you panic symptoms may appear to have gone away and then they come back periodically when you&#039;re not expecting it. However for me both of these things ceased to continue after about a month. I have now been taking 50mg of this medication for 3 months and I can honestly say it is the best decision I&#039;ve ever made. My panic attacks, which I used to have roughly twice weekly have completely gone away to leave me feeling relaxed. I am also more confident doing the things that used to trigger my panic, causing me to feel happier and able to get on with life normally. Strongly recommend."
