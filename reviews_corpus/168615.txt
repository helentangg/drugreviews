"I started taking this medication for major depression and anxiety. The first month was great I was sleeping well and I was very happy and wasn&#039;t stressed then it all turned. I began to have vivid nightmares that I woke crying and screaming. I started having trouble staying asleep not just from the nightmares but I couldn&#039;t bring myself to sleep. I stopped taking the meds and talked to my psychiatrist about my concerns I told her I didn&#039;t take the meds everyday at the same time so she told me to try it again. I started a strick time regimen. I started having dizzy spells, started hallucinating, nightmares again, I would get weak and Shakey. I took sleep meds still no sleep. I still had depression. It was horrible."
