"I&#039;ve  been on Zoloft for about month now,  I was suffering from Depression for a few yrs now. I&#039;m 30yrs. About 4 months ago I became severely depressed and suicidal. I finally went to the Doctor to start something. My depression was horrible. The first week I began taking this my suicide thoughts stopped. I still had a hard time getting out of bed but I wasn&#039;t feeling this horrible despair, I was just depressed and continued for the next weeks. I knew I felt a little better. About 2 days ago I started feeling better, I was able to get out of bed easier, and stay out, I do have trouble sleeping. But I feel okay. This medicine has saved me."
