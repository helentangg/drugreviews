"I was prescribed Cymbalta as a preventative for intractable migraines. I was also dealing with some depression due to my chronic pain. 
I was on a dose of 20mg at bed and was to increase to 40mg after 2 weeks. After my first dose, I awoke with general nausea. I had diarrhea once that 1st day. After my 2nd dose the worst of it started. I awoke three times that night with diarrhea - literally. I didn&#039;t wake up having to run to the the bathroom. I was awakened because I was in the process of soiling myself in bed. I couldn&#039;t eat, lost 5lbs in a week, had diarrhea the whole time. I stopped talking it and had the worst migraine of my life and electric zaps for two days after. Just say no to Cymbalta."
