"Zoloft is amazing. I was put on Lexapro when I was about 18, gained about 20 lbs and felt like a numb zombie for about a year. Tried Celexa for about a year- a little better, but I was still getting very depressed. Then I tried Zoloft (50mg for a month and 100mg since). I&#039;ve been on it for about 2 years. Depression and anxiety is minimal. I rarely have to use my Xanax. The only side effect I&#039;ve had is dry mouth but it&#039;s minimal at worst. My appetite and sleep patterns are normal. As with the others I&#039;ve tried, my sex drive is very low and I had moderate headaches for the first couple of weeks, so I won&#039;t pick on Zoloft for that.  Overall, extremely satisfied, I can&#039;t imagine my life without it."
