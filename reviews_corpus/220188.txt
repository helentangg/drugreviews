"After trying many different anti-depressants and sleep aids with little to no results, my doctor put me on 75mg of Amitriptyline for severe postpartum depression and anxiety with insomnia.  This was the miracle I needed. I sleep really well now am back to my happy,healthy self.  
I have dry mouth as a side effect, but I have learned to chew gum and use biotene at bed time. This regimen has made that one side effect tolerable and I don&#039;t mind it, considering what this medicine has done for me. I workout regularly and watch what I eat so I have not experienced any weight gain."
