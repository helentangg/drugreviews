"I was on fluoxetine for depression and stress 3 years ago for about a year. I used to be tearful, very unmotivated and stressed out by day to day things. I can&#039;t remember any side effects but can remember feeling calmer and happier. All my problems were &quot;just out of reach&quot; - not stressing me out but could be dealt with as and when I wanted to. I was assaulted at work 5 months ago. I have for the past 5 months struggled to come to terms with it, combined with self pressure to prove myself work wise and perceived pressure to &quot;bounce back&quot; from work I have ended up in a right old mess. Prescribed fluoxetine 9 days ago. I have had various side effects - dizziness, &quot;disjointed&quot; feeling in my head but definitely calmer and less tearful."
