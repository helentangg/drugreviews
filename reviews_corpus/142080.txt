"My son is 8yrs old and has asperger&#039;s with an emphasis in anxiety. When the doc prescribed Lexapro at 10mg he had a manic episode, but when decreased to 5mg MY SON SMILED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 2YRS! For a mom there is no greater feeling. We have to occationally use an additional anxiety medicine durning periods of intense stress but for maintenance therapy it&#039;s great. I only gave it a rating of 7 due to the severe WEIGHT GAIN he has experienced. Good luck to all who suffer"
