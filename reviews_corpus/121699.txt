"I started having panic attacks at age 10, always been a struggle, then started having really bad bouts of depression.  Things got to stage where I was just so tired of being scared all the time and finding it hard to function. I&#039;ve been on many antidepressants through the years,   Lexapro I had been in for over 10 years,  phych weaned me off and put me on Effexor.   I actually can&#039;t believe this. It&#039;s only day 2 On 37.5mg to be increased to 75 next week,  but I swear I feel a calmness I haven&#039;t felt before, surely after 2 days I&#039;m thinking this can&#039;t be right, but after reading some reviews I can see that others have had relief in a short time from this medicine. No side effects. Just feel calm. Feeling hopeful"
