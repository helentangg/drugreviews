"I have been taking Effexor for 4 weeks.  The side effects have been miserable.  I have tried taking it in the morning, and at night but  I&#039;m always tired and dizzy.  Sometimes I even feel like a zombie.  I must say, the only good thing about Effexor (for me) is it has decreased my anxiety, unless I skip a day ... then watch out and get out of my way. The comments regarding withdrawal scare me.  Please tell me this gets better. "
