"Prozac has been a miracle for my anxiety. My anxiety was always like a constant static in my head. This &quot;static&quot; has caused me to have social anxiety has well. On Prozac, I feel my anxiety (the static in my head) isn&#039;t holding me back anymore, I talk to people and I can finally be happy and free."
