"I was diagnosed with Interstitial Cystitis about 2 years ago.  I tried bladder instillations, read books about natural healing and pretty much refused any medication.  After a year and a half of suffering and trying gluten free, dairy free, egg free, yeast free for over 8 weeks I finally gave up the natural route and agreed to 25 mg of amitriptyline once a day.  Bottom line--it works.  It really does.  I still have the frequency but the pain is almost completely gone.  There have been some days when I feel the pain but I take an extra dose and it helps so much.  I do have to say though, it makes me tired, I&#039;ve gained about 30 pounds and waking up in the morning is harder than ever.  Still, it&#039;s worth it."
