"I have been taking Pristiq for 1 week. 43y Male. First time treating depression. I could &quot;feel&quot; a difference within hours. Hard to believe maybe, but it was a slight improvement. Every day (EVERY SINGLE DAY) has been better than the one before. It is gradual, but VERY noticeable. My wife says &quot;you are coming back&quot; and my son says &quot;thank you for not freaking out so much&quot; and my co-workers are noticing. I even told a joke in a crowd this week (instead of just feeling like I want to leave and be alone) - I am AMAZED. I had sweats and some minor side effects in the first 4 days, but they are completely gone. I am so thankful for this medication. Thank you to the scientists who developed this. You are changing my life for the better!"
