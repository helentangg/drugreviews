"I&#039;ve been diagnosed over 20 years ago with major depression and was hospitalized.  Took Prozac and after 5 years was able to taper off.  Depression came back the last year and was diagnosed with recurrent major depression.  After having a bad reaction to Wellbutrin, my psychiatrist suggested Viibryd because of the non-side effects for sexual desire.  I took 10mg for two weeks, and while it did seem to help with my depression, I did notice insomnia, increase in anxiety in the morning as well as an increase in the ringing in my ears. I have some tinnitus, but I found that the Viibryd increase it so much that it made it unbearable for me.  I had to stop the medication and noticed major recurrence of anger and sadness."
