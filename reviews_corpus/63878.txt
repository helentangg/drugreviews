"I have been taking Sertraline for 11 days now for depression and I can honestly say I&#039;ve never felt so low  in my life. I am having to stick with them as everyone says that it gets better. Really annoyed that these pills can be prescribed with no real warning from doctors as to how very very low they can make you feel."
