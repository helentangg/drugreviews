"I have been on Pristiq for over a year now. I started of on 
a 50mg dose for 3 months for my anxiety and panic attacks. All went well but still was only just helping my anxiety, I went back to my Doctor and he upped the dose to 100mg. I immediately had improvements. No more panic attacks and felt great."
