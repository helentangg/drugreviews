"I have been taking different medicines for depression for the last 20 years.  I have tried almost everything and Wellbutrin is the only thing that has even helped me.  I have noticed only a very minor improvement but it is better than no improvement.  I was advised to take Cymbalta with it.  Even with my insurance, it still costs me $50 a month!  I tried it for 3 months with no noticeable change.  I can&#039;t afford to waste money on something that may or may not work.  I figured for that much money, this drug should be very good.  At least the Wellbutrin only costs me $10 a month and I do get some noticeable help from it."
