"Cymbalta is so far the only medication that has noticeably helped with my depression and anxiety. I had more confidence and less anxiety while taking it. I say &quot;had&quot; because I turned 26 recently and no longer have insurance and Cymbalta is extremely expensive, something like $216 with coupon, so I switched to Lexapro. I will write a review on Lexapro once I get experience it&#039;s affects. Cymbalta is the way to go if you can afford it though."
