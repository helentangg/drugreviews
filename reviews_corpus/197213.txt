"I was hesitant to take an antidepressant, but glad I did.  Thought the initial dose was TOO strong, made me a walking zombie, I cut it in half and took it just prior to bed.  My hot flashes have gone from one an hour to only a couple a day. Night sweats have all but gone.  It did take about a week after I cut the dose, but saw a gradual reduction in frequency, duration, and strength almost immediately.  Worst side effect is a severe dry mouth, but I&#039;ve always needed to drink more and the Biotene products have also worked well for this minor irritation (...compared to the hot flashes which had not reduced over the last five years.  Thought this was supposed to go away after a while). Luv this medicine."
