"After trying several other medications viibryd does help with my depression. Unfortunately I have had many side effects including insomnia, Vivid abnormal dreams, night sweats, and numbness in my hands. I have been taking 20 milligrams a day for almost a year. My depression has started to increase and I am hesitant to increase the viibryd to 40 milligrams a day because I am afraid the side effects will get worse. 

The drug manufacturer offers a very good rebate program on their website. I get $100 refund from them each month so my cost is only $115 per month."
