"Headaches and a little nausea at the start, now 4 months in, I don&#039;t know how I coped before. The anxious &quot;bad butterflies&quot; that I thought were normal, have gone away. Obsessive over thinking and cringing after I got home because what I may have said, has gone away. Feeling almost hyper active and intense when in a group situation, almost gone. Road rage....work in progress! Hahaha. Sex drive has diminished but this might be a good thing as was obsessive about it before. Less pressure. Wish I had started a lot earlier. Thought my anxiety was part of my personality, but the reality is, without it, I&#039;m back to me again."
