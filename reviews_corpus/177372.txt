"I have GAD and mild depression.  I initially had side effects such as insomnia, no appetite, and nausea but they went away after a few days.  This has helped my anxiety tremendously! It is not without side effects though.  If I forget to take it I will get nausea, headaches and dizziness. I did gain weight and some diarrhea but it has had no bad sexual side effects.  I have been taking this for a year now.  I am finding that the depression is now increasing so maybe time for a dosage change. Just keep in mind everyone is different and sometimes the benefits outweigh the effects."
