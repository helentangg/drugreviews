"I was on Prozac for 6 months and it was completely horrible for me. Nightmares every night and suicide was way more compelling. I stopped takin the medicine cold turkey. A week ago I got put on 5 mg samples of Brintellix. It has been working fine, but my whole body has been itching like crazy. It&#039;s so bad I have blood spots &amp; bruises all on my body. I&#039;m calling my doctor tomorrow to see what they can do about it."
