"Have had a long history of having &quot;racing&quot; thoughts.  Finally after many years and missed diagnoses with accompanying different medicines, my current Psych Doctor said that I might have a touch of obsessive compulsive disorder. He placed me on 25mg per day for a week, then 50 mg per day.  Finally, I feel much better and my mind is finally more at rest.  I was supposed to increase the dose to 75 mg after one week, which I tried for one day, but I had some weird side-effects that I attributed to the 75 mg dose.  Back at 50mg and am happy with the results.  Time will tell."
