"Worked great up until Tuesday when I had a sudden attack of dizziness that dropped me to the floor.  This continued for two days and I finally called the doc yesterday who took me off of it.  I went back to lexapro as I had no side effects with it.  It&#039;s too soon to tell if I will have any withdrawal from it, but I&#039;m hoping not, I have a busy day at work today.  I&#039;m glad to be off it though, I had a dizzy spell a few minutes ago but it was not bad and stopped quickly.  Guess I&#039;ll stick to lexapro and just deal with the depression as it comes."
