"I&#039;ve been taking 60mg  of Cymbalta and 300mg of Lyrica along with other meds like Tylenol 3, Vicodin, trazodone,  alprazolam and vitamins for about 9 months for fibromyalgia. I haven&#039;t noticed much of any difference in the pain dept. The only thing I notice is the trazodone and alprazolam helps me sleep about 5-6 hours a night. The pain is still there and I&#039;m just getting so tired of all the pain and frustration. I&#039;ve seen a rheumatologist and a physiatrist but nothing has changed. I don&#039;t know what else to do or try."
