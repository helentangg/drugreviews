"I began taking Sertraline in place of Cymbalta. I had increased Sertraline dose while I decrease the Cymbalta dose. I was very pleasantly surprised that I did not have any withdrawal symptoms from the Cymbalta while I had the sertraline in my system at the same time. When I finally tapered off Cymbalta completely and was only on Sertraline daily (75mg), within 2 days I knew it was not the medication for me because I suddenly became hostile, depressed, had a ton of mood swings, and began having bad panic attacks. Going back to he doc ASAP to fix this."
