"I&#039;m taking this for general anxiety disorder and major depression disorde. 20 mg.  It&#039;s been a couple of months.  It works great nicer and happier and I have lost 17 pounds. I  have tried to get my medicine right the past year by trying everything. I was on  celexa ( was on a few years gained a lot of weight and stopped working), latuda, strattera, pristiq, vyvanse I&#039;m allergic to. The only problem is Prozac doesn&#039;t mix well with concerta that I took a long time ago, it  used to work so well, now I tried it with Prozac and it&#039;s cry all day long.  So going back to dr soon need to find something else to mix in with my Prozac."
