"I was prescribed 10 mg Lexapro in March of 2009 for anxiety. It worked well as far as the anxiety was concerned but I decided to stop taking it in April 2010 because of the side effects--weight gain (I gained about 10 pounds even though I was a consistent gym rat and my diet did not change) and a pretty much non existent libido. This is NOT A MEDICINE YOU CAN JUST STOP TAKING. My doctor weaned me off by having me take 5 mg everyday for 2 weeks and then 5 mg every other day for a week. The withdrawl symptoms were not bad until I stopped taking it all together. I&#039;ve noticed I&#039;ve been easily fatigued and have constant dizziness, which seems to be worse in the mornings--hopefully it will subside soon."
