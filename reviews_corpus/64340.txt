"Tried this after Lexapro didn&#039;t work for me. Started 50mg of Zoloft and gradually got worse. Really didn&#039;t enjoy this drug. Decreased mood &amp; irritability, increased suicidal thoughts, completely wiped out my appetite. Felt much better after I stopped taking it (had taken it for 4 weeks)."
