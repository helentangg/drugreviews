"I&#039;ve been on Elavil for three years  and it has been a God-send: Ironically, I was seeing a Gastrointestinal doctor until she recommended that I &quot;stop and smell the roses more.&quot; Combined with therapy sessions for about a year, I worry less as I see more of what really is worth getting worked up over -- not a whole lot.  One can be passionate about certain things such as family and country and life, but other things are less, way-less significant.  Elavil has taught me how to best sort out what some things are worth worrying over and not.  I take 100mg/day at 8pm normally and I sleep well at night, and feel good generally about how things will be throughout the next day.  I love the smell of roses. "
