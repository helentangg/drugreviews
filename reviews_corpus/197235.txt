"I felt so much less anxious initially, so foolishly, and with doctors encouragement, I stayed on Paxil for 3-4 years.  Two months ago, I started to ween myself off this medicine very slowly. I have never felt so bad in my 72 years of life.  At first, I felt it must be the flu though I&#039;d had a flu shot in November of last year (13).  The withdrawal symptoms of nausea, vomiting, hot flashes. Not thinking clearly, fatigue, extremely vivid and frightening dreams, dizziness, and depression lasted 5-6 days.  My doctor recommended that I go back on Paxil at half a tablet initially, and then a whole tablet after a week.  So it has been two weeks now of my taking a 40mg. Dose each evening.  I tried documenting my terrible experience."
