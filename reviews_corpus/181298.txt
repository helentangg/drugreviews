"I combine thid pill (20mg) with adderall 20mg and it has really helped me with the aderrall&#039;s withdraw (anxiety/desperation/bad mood/even suicidal thoughts). At first I didnt felt like it was doing something to me, but I have observed during this month that I no longer have panic attacks that adderall used to provoke in me"
