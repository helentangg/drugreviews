"Severely inflamed Achilles tendons, rotator cuffs issues plus slipped disc pain in the neck. The past 3.5 years my life has been about pain all over. No-one would listen. Went to see a podiatrist and he prescribed Cymbalta 60mg. Felt much better the first day. However had 2 days on being constipated. Now, I can walk without pain. My whole body is more relaxed and I teamed the Cymbalta with an anti-inflammatory vitamin mix. I was recently told by my chiropractor that my body is very hyposensitive and swollen. So yes feeling much relieved."
