"June 23, Dr. prescribed 20 mg. of Celexa for social anxiety at work. I was running out of options. Thought I was going to have to stop working after 20 yrs. with the same company. My 15 year teen felt sorry for us. Tried Zoloft at first,made me very tired, more like a (zombie).  The Celexa 20 mg. first dose, made me feel wired, scared, paranoid, more anxiety, I could not leave the house. A coworker who have very good success with Celexa recommended me to start with 1/4 mg. of a 10 mg. tablet and increase it when my body and mind  work it out.....and it did!  About every 5 days, However, the FIRST AND SECOND week I took off work and watch t.v. and went walking.  Now I am at 10 mg. in 1 month. Social Anxiety gone,plan to increase to 15 mg."
