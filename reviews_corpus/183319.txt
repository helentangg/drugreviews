"I love this medicine! My anxiety started off as mild and as years past slowly got worse. I went from having social anxiety to generalized anxiety and then major depression. It took me 7 years to find this medicine but once I found it I gained my life back. Still have a little anxiety but most is gone. This medicine was great for my major depression. Yes it does have some side effects but most will disappear with time and like most other users will vouch, the benefits far outweigh the side mild side effects. "
