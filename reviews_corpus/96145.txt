"I&#039;ve just switched from venlafaxine to sertraline (four week switch-over) because the former was affecting my sodium levels. However I&#039;ve only just stopped the last of the venlafaxine last week and am on 100mg. 
POSITIVE EFFECTS: not depressed, not dead.
 
NEGATIVE EFFECTS: moderate manic symptoms (four hours&#039; sleep in 24, talking and laughing too much for others&#039; comfort, easily distracted, spending money like water, intolerance of quiet and calm). However it could be that I&#039;m just on too high a dose for my sensitivity to the medicine and I haven&#039;t done anything dangerous nor lost insight like I can do on other medicines."
