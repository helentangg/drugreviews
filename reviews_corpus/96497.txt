"I have been on Zoloft 100mg for a few months now for my anxiety/panic disorder. It has completely controlled my panic attacks, which is awesome. When I first started this medicine I became depressed, had suicidel thoughts, and no appetite. But those have since gone away as well. The only issue I have noticed still is I have no sex drive. Just wondering if this is normal with this drug and if it will eventually go back to normal."
