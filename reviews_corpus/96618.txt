"I started takin Zoloft when I was 16 or 17. It was the 2nd antidepressant I tried and I loved it! The side effects were less servere than any other med I&#039;ve tried today, the only downside was that after awhile I noticed it stopped working and I was increasing my dosage more frequently. I started on 25mg and worked up to 200-250mg."
