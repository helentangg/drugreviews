"At theage  of 53, I have been suffering from depression for about 10 years now and have tried most of the common antidepressants. The only one to help for a while was Venlafaxine. Have been on Brintellix for a year now, but only because my doctor doesn&#039;t know what else to try. No noticeable effect on my depression; restlessness and sleeping problems as side-effects if taking the full dose of 20 mgs. No effect on thinking and concentration either. I am rather disappointed."
