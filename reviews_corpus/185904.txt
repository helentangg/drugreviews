"I have been on name brand Pristiq for nearly a decade and doing great. Depression, anger, sex drive, all were in check for a number of years. Like many others I was forced to move to the generic by insurance. It took a few weeks but noticed I was shorter tempered, irritated, and lost all sexual drive to the point of being disinterested. Requested going back to name-brand after two months of generic and immediately felt better. Stress level is down and I can handle it without being irritated. 
Disappointing that insurance and big-pharma just need their profits instead of helping people.
Cost on Pristiq before detectable - $65
After deductible - $15.
Generic - $15
Pristiq after generic was available and ins won&#039;t cover the name brand -$311"
