"So far, so good.  I haven&#039;t been on it very long but I definitely feel like my overall quality of life has improved.  Mild headache and nausea the first week or two, which went away.  I still get sad, when sad things happen, but it no longer feels overwhelming. The &quot;doom and gloom&quot; is definitely gone.
