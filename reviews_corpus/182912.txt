"I&#039;ve just been on 60mg for 4 weeks and the improvement has been great.  My anxiety is all but gone..and I can&#039;t tell you how good it feels not to worry about every single thing i life.  I enjoy things more and can focus longer as a result, absorbing things better, instead of just randomly seeing everything.  I was a bit nauseous to start and tired, but its all but gone as well.  I&#039;ve also lost 2 pounds..Very happy so far!"
