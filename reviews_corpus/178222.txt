"I have been taking Cymbalta for 6 weeks, my husband said he had noticed a change in me for the better. My appetite has decreased but I am sleepy. I can barely hold my eyes open mid afternoon. I am hoping this will subside because I feel calmer and more at ease. Also, I am breastfeeding my 7 month old baby. I was told by my doctor it is safe. I have not noticed any changes in my baby. If I did I would stop right away.
