"I&#039;ve been taking Celexa for about 2 months now and my life is completely different.  I have been struggling with depression on and off for about 14 years now.  It was getting really bad for me, I was at the point where I couldn&#039;t control my emotions at all.  It made me very drowsy at first, but that subsided after a couple of weeks.  I feel so much better inside and people around me can tell a distinct difference too.  I like the fact that it doesn&#039;t make me emotionless, just that my emotions aren&#039;t so strong and out of control.  I still get sad, but that is a normal human emotion.  I am so thankful that there are ways to make people like me feel better.  Depression is a disease, not a choice."
