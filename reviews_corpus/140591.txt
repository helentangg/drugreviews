"I was given lexapro 10 mg once per day I have been on it since July as my anxiety was pretty bad I was also given Xanax ( which did noting ) so they gave me Valium ( still had no effect) so j have been just taking lexapro now and it seems to be ok , I still get nervous feeling sometimes but not as bad as they were . In the first two weeks of taking lexapro I felt very sick I got sick a few times and just felt rotten but the Dr did tell that would happen and after about 2 weeks I felt perfect again ,"
