"I have been diagnosed as manic depressive, A.D.D. &amp; suffer from high levels of stress &amp; anxiety. I was on Zoloft from 2004 (13y.o.) to 2013 (22), with my highest mg being 150 or 175. Worked ok, but made me zobified. I still had panic attacks &amp; my mood was off. I&#039;ve been on Citalopram for a month now, just 20mg, &amp; it&#039;s helped a LOT. After having my son in 2013, I decided to stay off meds (weaned myself at 22 weeks bc of risk of defects), figuring I might be able to do this on my own. I noticed irritability immediately after he was born. It took me a while to convince myself I needed meds again, when I had an awful panic attack &amp; couldn&#039;t sleep. Being on Citalopram has decreased my irritability, &amp; made me a lot less nervous. I&#039;m even working!"
