"I take prestiq for anxiety (first) &amp; depression. I don&#039;t know what the true definition of &quot;normal&quot; is but, this is the closest I&#039;ve felt to it in quite some time.  My most recent attempt of feeling &quot;normal&quot; was with 8 years/ lexapro. My concentration level was on point &amp; my anxiety level was low but,  the zombie like feel, the lack of sex drive &amp; weight gain eventually drove me to find an alternative. After several failed attempts with various other options, I can say that prestiq has proven to disprove most, if not all, of my concerns. Yes,  I still get fiery mad at times (with good reason) but, it&#039;s controllable. Yes, I still get sad/anxious but,  there are tangible reasons &amp; I am now able to pull myself out a lot sooner."
