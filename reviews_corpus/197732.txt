"I started taking Pristiq about 4 months ago and it has proven to be wonderful. I suffer from depression and borderline personality disorder. Almost immediately I saw an improvement. Before taking Pristiq I would fly into a rage almost daily. In the last 4 months since taking it I have maybe raged 5 times. I don&#039;t feel so self-conscious anymore. I feel more alive and upbeat. And to top it off I&#039;ve lost weight since the drug decreases appetite. My wonder drug."
