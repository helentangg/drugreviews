"I have been taking Elavil for a month now, and I am almost migraine free.  I was started on 25mg at bedtime.  My headaches lessend, but still had them.  Maybe one out of 4 was really bad.  So my MD doubled the dose to 50mg a night, and boy that did the trick but I stayed tired all the time.  I went back to 25mg every night and now it seems to be working very well for me.  Just takes time to adjust. So if you have just started, hang in there, it will get better!"
