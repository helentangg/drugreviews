"I was diagnosed 13 years ago as bipolar. I have been on a total of 14 different medications. After a few months, the effectiveness of the medication would start to wear off. I would tell my doctor and he would up my dosage, then I would become a zombie.  Cymbalta so far has been the only medication that I have been on for more that a year and a half.  The only side effects I have noticed and that are starting to subside are; tremors, excessive sweating and night sweats, excessive rambling, minor confusion, and fatigue. They are starting to subside, but the medication has been a God send for me and my family."
