"I&#039;ve been on antidepressants for years and suffered from chronic pain that was finally diagnosed as fibromyalgia.  I started on Cymbalta about 5 years ago because the pain was becoming more than I could deal with and my doctor had read good reviews about patients reactions with this medicine.  I never had any problem with the medicine and haven&#039;t noticed any major side effects.  It has really cut the pain to a manageable level and kept my spirits up."
