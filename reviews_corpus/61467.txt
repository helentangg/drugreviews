"I&#039;m on the generic version Citolopram. First 10mg for 7 days then up&#039;d to 20mg. Now on that for little over 4 weeks. Still feel blah. I&#039;ve been switching when I take it to see if it helps sleep. Well apparently you need to take at night! It&#039;s cousin to lexapro. I just took my 20mg at 9a.m.(to see) an its 2 hrs later an I&#039;m very sleepy. I&#039;m giving it 6 wks . I&#039;m on med #7. I hope this works. Not many left for me to try. Not much side effects with Celexa. Occasional anxiety but I also have Klonapine when needed. So going back to take at night. I am having night sweats occasionally  also but lethargy during day."
