"I have schizophrenia and was prescribed this in hospital alongside antipsychotics and mood stabilisers. It has a slightly &quot;stimulating&quot; effect so can be effective for depression associated with negative symptoms and flatness. However, it does as all psychiatric medicines do, make you feel somewhat empty inside. At higher doses (where dopamine is effected) it is very reliable in helping with severe anxiety and depression as I had. In lower doses (mainly serotonin effected) it works like an SSRI, and I did not find it helpful. Worked up to 225mg but was reduced after several hypomanic episodes. Remained on 150mg for some time, then down to 75mg. May as well have been taking paracetamol at the lower dose, as it did nothing for me. Overall a good medicine."
