"A neurologist prescribed this for me several years ago because of the terrible debilitating headaches I was having. The kind that puts you in the bed because you can&#039;t function. It really did help. I tried awhile back to go off of it and the headaches returned so I started back and they subsided again. I won&#039;t try stopping taking it again as long as I stay headache-free."
