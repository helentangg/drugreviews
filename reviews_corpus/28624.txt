"I have been on Lexapro for about two weeks now and I can definitely tell the difference. I have depression and anxiety and this medicine has helped me manage both. I had a horrible temper and I was always verbally attacking my husband because I had conditioned myself to be all the defensive so that insults wouldn&#039;t bother me. I have been able to tell the difference that I am not angry with my husband all of the time. He doesn&#039;t like the fact that I am on medication but he acknowledges that the change in me has been extremely helpful in making our relationship better."
