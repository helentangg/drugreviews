"I suffer from OCD and intrusive/compulsive thoughts that create almost unbearable anxiety. In Oct &#039;11, I was prescribed Zoloft and found it to work incredibly. On 100mg, my OCD is 85-90% gone, and I can easily rationalize and even blow off my intrusive/compulsive thoughts about 95% of the time. I felt better within a week, but it did take 3-4 weeks for me to notice its full effect. I&#039;d describe the feeling it gives as light, airy and happy/drifty. I haven&#039;t experienced any side effects, and haven&#039;t gained any weight. On a side note, I also found that one huge factor contributing to my anxiety is too much caffeine, even when taking Zoloft (I still have one cup of coffee to wake up in the morning, but I&#039;ve found that&#039;s my strict limit)."
