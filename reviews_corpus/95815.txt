"Prescribed Mirtazapine 18 months for mild depression. I started panicking and depression worsened, I became hyper anxious.I was lucky to get a different Dr when I turned up hysterical at the surgery. He took me off mirtazapine and moved me gradually onto sertraline. Horrific. I couldn&#039;t eat or sleep, I paced for hours in circles. For 12 weeks I was a suicide focused unstable shaking retching mess. I lost 2 stone. I was given a preset dose of diazepam and lorazepam at intervals throughout the day. My husband or mother shuttled me backwards and forwards so I was never left alone. Gradually we built up the dosage of sertraline to 200mg and stopped the benzos . I don&#039;t feel anxiety or depression, I feel fantastic, confident, energetic, happy"
