"This is the 2nd time using this medicine. The 1st time it rid me of the severe depressive cycle I was in, but the mania crept back in very slowly so I didn&#039;t notice it until it was too late. And by late, I mean &quot;all over the place&quot; so I stopped taking it. This time around I am taking it coupled with Lamictal. The cycles are normalizing now after just over 2 months. Want to add that I put myself on a sleeping schedule and use medicine if I need it after 20 minutes of no sleep. This sleep program has helped tremendously."
