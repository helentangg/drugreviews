"I took Lexapro for a little over a year and it worked beautifully.  The only reason I weaned off was because of weight gain.  My Doctor prescribed 10mg of Prozac and said it should not cause any weight gain.  I am on it 17 days now and my only side effect is slight anxiety and a few panic attacks.  I had none of this on Lexapro.  My question is, should I hand in there and when will I feel good?"
