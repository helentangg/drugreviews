"I&#039;m 19 years old, I&#039;ve suffered from depression, stress, bulimia and anxiety for several years. My background is Chinese, therefore my parents are very judgmental (not all Chinese parents are) but they don&#039;t really believe in such kind of illness and they will lose face if any of their friends knew what was wrong with me, one day I couldn&#039;t bare it so I went to the doc, she gave me citalopram 10mg. This is my second day, I&#039;ve experience dizziness and diarrhea but apart from that I feel like I&#039;ve been more happy and positive."
