"I have taken many antidepressants as an adult and since I have been on this one I have not been depressed.  We all know what it feels like to not go on. I have no side effects. I feel healthy and normal. I wake up every day no matter what struggles and I have not felt &quot;down,&quot; like depressing down in over a year.  I love it.  I also take Klonopin for my anxiety on the side.  I don&#039;t need as much though.  Viibryd works wonders!"
