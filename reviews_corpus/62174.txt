"I&#039;m one day into week seven and I caught myself smiling and singing on way to work. I wasn&#039;t anxious, or nervous. I truly feel like me today, I want to cry Thank you! I feel like a million bucks. The only real side effect I had was nausea. I would have it everyday if I knew I would be me again.  So Happy me today! Yea"
