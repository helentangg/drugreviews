"This medication has literally given me my life back!  I struggle with depression and anxiety and for those out there reading this and looking to find someone you can relate to.  Let me tell you, you aren&rsquo;t alone.  I started this drug about 6 months ago and when I first started, I, like you, came to this site looking for reviews to help me get through it.  Like other people on this board have mentioned it takes about 4 weeks to get used to it.  I had to take it in conjuncture to Clonepan because it made my anxiety a lot worse at first and I was super paranoid about it and having panic attacks.  Just breath.  You will make it through and the other side is life as it should be!  Stick with it it&rsquo;s worth it !!"
