"I&#039;ve been using fluoxetine now for 2 and a half months and it didn&#039;t work immediately. The first week it definitely reduced the flashes by about 66%. The next few weeks it gradually reduced more and more. This is where I am now..hot flushes.. about 2 very slight, I can hardly class it as a hot flush anymore. I&#039;ve had about 2 night sweats in the past month. My angry moods have gone and will not be persuaded to stop taking this medication. Its a little miracle that has changed my life for the better.. yaaaaaaaayy"
