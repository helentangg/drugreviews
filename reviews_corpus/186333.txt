"I&#039;ve started 50 mg 50 days ago, increased to 100 mg in 25 days ago, increased to 150 mg 10 days ago. It has had no effect except for side effect (weight increase and constipation). I don&#039;t understand because with Effexor I had a response. Thinking to go to Wellbutrin because of the no weight gain."
