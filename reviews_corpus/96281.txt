"I have been taking this for 10 years. I originally was prescribed this for anxiety and panic attacks, which I think was a side effect of undiagnosed depression.  It works great for that.  However, it does absolutely nothing for depression for me.  I am switching to Prozac soon because this is like taking nothing for depressive symptoms. I was also on Pristiq, and I will say for me Zoloft is better simply because I don&#039;t have rage fits and mania like I do on Pristiq."
