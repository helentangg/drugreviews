"I was in bad shape for 5 and 1/2 years when I was prescribed Lexapro. Uncontrollable crying, going into fits, breaking things. Flying off the handle for no reason. Two weeks on Lexapro and I had everything under control until the day my doctor wouldn&#039;t refill my script until I went to see him. I didn&#039;t have time for a visit so I just did without it. On about the 3rd day I was feeling strange, off balance, light headed, kind of fuzzy. 4th day when I turned my head I felt like I was in an old time movie, click-click-click. I went to the doctor, told him I wasn&#039;t feeling well, he didn&#039;t tell me why I was feeling like that but to take my Lexapro and I would feel better."
