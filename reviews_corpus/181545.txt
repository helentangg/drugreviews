"5 weeks on Prozac. Have lost ten pounds (and needed to do so).  Appetite remains but I finally know when I&#039;m full.  Cannot drink more than an occasional glass of wine, do not feel like drinking any longer. Energy up, anxiety down.  I have agitation that I didn&#039;t have before, however sleeping 9 hours per night, but I always did that anyway. But sleeping more soundly.  Sex drive is down (am female).  Strange, detailed dreams.  Feeling benevolent, but oddly detached and very happy.  Still laugh a lot, but not interested in being creative very much."
