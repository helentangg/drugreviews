"20mg Citalipram was prescribed by my doctor for depression.  A few things, one of them maybe odd, that I&#039;ve noticed over the past two years of being on it.

I felt queasy and had slight nausea the first couple of weeks but then that settled down to a nice sheen of calm over me or something. Very nice.  But I began having difficulty getting an erection or ejaculating strongly. I figured a permanent side effect.  The thing is that around 6 months later, I started having very strong erections and deep orgasms.  Much stronger than I&#039;ve historically had.  When my doctor eventually decreased my dose to 15mg and now 10mg, orgasms are now much less intense.  It seems my side effects differ from others sexually."
