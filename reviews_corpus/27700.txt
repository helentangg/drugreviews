"I had a terrible experience on this drug. It resulted in me having regular panic attacks, heart palpitations, caused me to become trapped in negative state and paranoid. I&#039;m not one who reviews meds very often but this medication proved to be very dangerous for me. I spent a lot of time in a state of paranoia. My Dr did not listen to me when I kept stating it wasn&#039;t right for me. In the end I reduced my dose ( I don&#039;t condone this though ) and have been off it for around 4 months now. I can honestly say I&#039;m doing much better , able to function, don&#039;t stay on states of paranoia etc. I&#039;m also able to make clear choices etc."
