"Out of all the serotonin based drugs that literally have nothing to really do with true clinical depression; this is the better of the SSRI and SNRI class. Not anywhere as dangerous and toxic as Cymbalta; although this medication is something I want to warn everyone about: Effexor very quickly makes you its slave. Probably by purpose it has a very short half-life which makes even missing one dose produces horrendous withdrawal effects I would have to say are just as bad as abrupt benzodiazepine withdrawal (which is documented to be as bad as kicking heroin!). I will admit I do think it did help me but I have to stress even the XR release only has a 24 hour half-life. So 8 AM rolls around; you have no choice."
