"Viibryd has had a really positive impact on my life. In January, I had a suicide attempt while being on Effexor. After hospital, I was taken off Effexor and given Viibryd, starting with 10mg. Of course, you don&#039;t feel a difference for a while, but you know when you do. The other antidepressants I have been on, Prozac, Lexapro, and Effexor all had little positive effect on me. In fact, they made me feel numb and more emotionless than my depression did (leading to the events early this year...) Viibryd, however, has made me feel close to normal. I feel emotions better than I did on the other drugs. Side effects: terrible diarrhea, night terrors, and low sex drive. Tolerable, though."
