"6 months on Lex for Anxiety . First days terrible but can not describe how amazing this drug is. It has brought back the old me! I am a hard worker again. I am the fittest and leanest I&#039;ve been. I no longer suffer over eating which was a side effect of my anxiety. Happy again! 
Definitely suggest taking 5mg at first and working way up. 
If I&#039;m having a hard time at work I sometimes up to 10mg but 5 is good and doesn&#039;t ruin my sex drive (it does die on 10mg though!)."
