"Lexapro has completely changed my life. I am a stay-at-home mom with 2 daughters under the age of 2 and my husband works very long hours. I had desperate feelings of isolation and sadness. I waited 2 months before going to the doctor because I wasn&#039;t sure that I had a problem, and after feeling the effects of Lexpapro I can now see that I obviously needed help. Lexapro makes me feel like I am able to breathe again and handle the situations in my life that cause me so much anxiety. Side effects- I am tired/sleepy all day long. I drink coffee and that helps. I should have started this medication years ago for other anxiety issues I now realize I have, after being on Lexapro. If you suspect you have postpartum depression, see your doctor!"
