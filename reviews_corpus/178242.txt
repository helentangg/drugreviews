"I have been off and on Cymbalta for over a year now. During a really stressful time in my life I was started on Zoloft and then Klonopin. The Zoloft gave me restless legs and Klonopin made me severely depressed. After a period of nothing my Doctor suggested Cymbalta. After just a few days things got so much better. I relaxed and was able to eat and sleep normally again. The side effects were very minimal and lasted less than a week. After hearing horror stories of stopping Zoloft. I quit by counting the granules and tapering down over a couple of months. It worked fine for me. I usually try to take it around noon with lunch for the best sleep at night."
