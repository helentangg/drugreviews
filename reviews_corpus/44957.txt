"after about 3 weeks on prozac, or as I like to call it CRAPZAC.
I was more depressed than ever before. Before crapzac I had only considered suicide a few times,
But after my 4th week I actually attempted it.
Thankfully my sister found me and brought me to the hospital, where they asked if i had been on any medication, and ordered me to stop taking it.

And I was trapped at the hospital in the psych ward for 9 days, having 2 sessions with the counsellor every day, strapped down to my bed for the first few days, and not allowed to use the bathroom for 2 days, this stuff made my life into a living hell.

After being released, I have now started seeing a therapist and now I&#039;ve been practicing yoga and meditation, with no meds, and I feel great"
