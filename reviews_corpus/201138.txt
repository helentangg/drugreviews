"I&#039;ve had panic disorder with agoraphobia for years now and have been going through medications, trying to find the right medicine and dose.  Zoloft (the generic of Zoloft) was the third medication I&#039;ve tried.  I started at a lower dose and went up to a dose of 100 mg daily.  I had no significant side effects on the lower dose, but experienced bad side effects at the higher dose, such as night sweats, very dry mouth, and issues in thought (such as losing my train of thought fairly frequently).  I weaned off slowly and experienced flu like body aches for a couple of weeks as I came off of it.  I don&#039;t recall any benefit that I got from being on this drug.  Unfortunately, this medicine did not work for me."
