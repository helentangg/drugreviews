"My Dr. started me on 50mg then slowly went up to 100  then 150 and now 200 mg within 3 months. I had anxiety for about 15 years and didn&#039;t realize I was that bad. My general practioner had me on Ativan and I have been on that for a good 10 years. I thought that was the end all/be all because it took away the panic for the time being - instant fix. I&#039;m 42 years old, like to excerise, working mom with a full life and I hated having panic attacks at the mall, small spaces, etc. I really thought I would always be that way and just had to deal with it but honestly the Zoloft saved me. It makes you so positive and you don&#039;t focus on the stuff that would bring on anxiety. I wished  I would&#039;ve had this long before now. Give it time.. it WILL work"
