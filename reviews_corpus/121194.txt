"I have been on this med for about a year and a half. I started taking 80mg and my anxiety got so much worse the first few weekz (very common) It didn&#039;t seem to be helping much so I upped my dose about 3 months later. Went up to 100mg and had to up it once more. I&#039;m currently on 185mg a day and it seems to help when I take it every day! (try not to miss a dose!) The symptoms I experienced are dry mouth, sleeplessness, no appetite, and no sex drive! After a while these all vanished besides the low sex drive (sadly). If I miss a dose my anxiety comes back full force (its severe!) It is a pretty good medicine if taken correctly but may have to be increased over time. Dont give up!"
