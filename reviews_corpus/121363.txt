"This is my first experience with any sort of medication like this. I&#039;ve been diagnosed with Late onset PTSD.  My medical support team and I are still finding a correct dosage, I&#039;m on 225/day now along with Ativan as needed and trazodone  to help me fall asleep.  I&#039;ve seen some improvement in my functioning, but I&#039;m not quite where I need to be yet"
