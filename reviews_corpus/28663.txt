"Hi, I&#039;m a recently divorced dad with 3 children. My entire life was turned upside down and inside out. I lost all my friends, went from being financially secure to having a 500k mortgage at the age of 47. I was living in total darkness and totally dysfunctional, finding faults, especially in my current partner and her children. My self esteem was non existent. I&#039;m taking Lexapro 10 mg a day and now I feel like I could carry the entire universe on my shoulders and could concur the world."
