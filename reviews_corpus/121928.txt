"I started taking the generic venlafaxine XR about one month ago for anxiety attacks and feelings of being overwhelmed. It started working within a few days. I have had a positive experience, although my sex drive is depleted and I&#039;m having much more difficulty reaching orgasm (I&#039;m female) I am now waking 3-4 times a night and although I can go right back to sleep feel tired every morning. I already take 1mg Klonopin at night and 350mg of Soma as I have degenerative neck disease. I am still waking up. I hope my doctor can give me some pointers on sleeping through the night, but other than that (oh and increased sweating at night!) I do feel great. We&#039;ll see how the sweating goes and the sleep disturbance."
