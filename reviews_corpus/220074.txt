"I went to see my Dr about restless legs at night which is quite painful. She prescribed 25mg at night before bed. It&#039;s was working well..no pain. However I fell over a couple of times which I thought was odd but didn&#039;t set any alarms off. I began to feel stiff and unable to bend over to pick things up. I was afraid I would hurt myself. Not realizing this was the drug. I figured this is what happens when you are close to 50. The worst side effect was the weight gain. I was on the drug for 3.5 months and gained 30 lbs.  Once again I figured it was because I was getting older. So the drug certainly helped my leg pain...but altered my body to look like the pilsner dough girl."
