"Started taking Celexa when I experienced depression and anxiety. It works well, and also helps my PMDD.  I tried other antidepressants but would recommend Celexa because it really helps me function. I give this med a 9 because sometimes I need to take two 10 mg tablets to give me a little extra boost. Overall though this med is excellent."
