"I have been using amitriptyline for about 6 months. I have spinal arthritis and am in great pain daily. Some days pain is really bad. I now take 75mg at night time. Although pain is still there at least I know I&#039;m going to have a good sleep. I do suffer from very dry mouth from this tablet and have also put on weight which again is a side effect. I feel this medicine has its uses but it didn&#039;t ease the pain for me."
