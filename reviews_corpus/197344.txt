"Paroxetine worked absolute wonders for me when I first started the paroxetine 6 years ago.  My mood elevated so high to the point of work colleagues questioning my &#039;nightclub activities&#039;. The &#039;serotonin high&#039; also made me aggressively confident and involved a few flashpoints including a physical fight- my first for 15 years. While it worked it was GREAT.  However, it lost it&#039;s efficacy suddenly a few months ago and I was prescribed sertraline/Zoloft which was a disaster.  Headaches, Nausea and insomnia was my bodies reaction to this medicine.  Have now been put on citalopram and hoping this will be effective.  My doctor suggested I may try paroxetine again if I don&#039;t respond to citalopram."
