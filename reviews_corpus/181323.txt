"They say this is supposed to take several weeks to kick in, but I noticed positive effects within 3 days of taking 20mg. Less irritable, less anxious, and feeling a bit more happy-go-lucky. I have noticed an increase in appetite, but I can&#039;t confirm if it&#039;s a side effect. I tend to eat more when I&#039;m happier, and lose appetite when depressed."
