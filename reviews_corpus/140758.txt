"I&#039;ve been taking Escitalopram for 16 days. I started on 2.5mg but it made me very tired, In fact, exhausted! Plus I couldn&#039;t sleep. I played around with the time of day I took it. Still tired!! I decided to start weaning off but within 3 days I was feeling suicidal again so I took 2.5mg again, then 3.75mg.  Within 2 days, feeling ok. Lots of energy. Cleaning. Visiting family. I actually feel too wired and have tremors so I&#039;m going to drop down to 3mg. this is a very powerful drug. Go slow. It&#039;s the fastest and most effective antidepressant I&#039;ve ever taken."
