"Started 10mg of lexapro today in addition to 10mg of buspirone twice a day which I have been taking for months, and xanax as needed. Thank goodness I took lexapro on my day off around 3 pm. The side effects took place just an hour after taking it and I&#039;m still battling them at 5 am the next morning! First I could barely keep my eyes open, I felt like I was going to fall asleep. Then I dealt with unbearable nausea, diarrhea, 10x worse anxiety, dilated pupils and now insomnia. I really want to give this drug a chance after reading all the great reviews, but I just don&#039;t know if I am willing to suffer through these side effects especially since I have been able to sleep very well recently which is something I have NEVER been able to say."
