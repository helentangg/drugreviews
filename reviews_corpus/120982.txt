"I tried just about everything for depression and venlafaxine was one of the only drugs to help. I was so depressed that I jumped off a building for a suicide attempt. I wound up paralyzed in a wheelchair. Venlafaxine took a while to work about 3 moths or so. I first took 75mg but didn&#039;t do much. It wasn&#039;t until I reached 375mg that I felt the true effects of the drug. Very very strong antidepressant effects. My mind is clear and I&#039;m feeling a warm glow all day. My depression so anxiety are gone even though I&#039;m paraplegic I am happy. Wish they gave this drug to me a long time ago I would not be In a wheelchair. You have to really be patient and find the right dose abs then one day you&#039;ll wake up and feel great."
