"Every drugs works differently for each person, but I have personally found Trintellix to be very helpful to my life. I have been taking 20mg for 4 months and it has helped so much with anxiety and depression. I&#039;m not &quot;cured&quot; of being an anxious person, but it no longer consumes me. Even if I worry about things, I don&#039;t have the physical, gut wrenching worry that I always had. I feel more positive about life and more positively about things I used to panic about. I&#039;m able to think rationally and manage. I had gotten to the point where none of the things I used to enjoy did anything for me. I have that back now after being on this medication. I laugh at things again, I don&#039;t just want to stay away and sleep. I can say I&#039;m truly happy again"
