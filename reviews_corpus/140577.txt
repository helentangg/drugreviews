"For me, escitalopram has worked wonders. I have been on it for a month now and have not felt the need to increase my 10mg dose yet. I did experience side effects early on, a little bit spaced out and some jaw clenching but these disappeared by 2 weeks. Having tried citalopram for a week and experiencing increased anxiety with it, I feel escitalopram is a better suited to me."
