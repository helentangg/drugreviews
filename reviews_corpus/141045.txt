"I started this medication a little over a month ago &amp; was very weary. I have had PTSD and suffer from anxiety for almost 10 years. My doctor recently suggested I give this a try to combat both anxiety and a mild case of depression. The first week and a half was not fun - I was tired, nauseous, I had hot flashes everything. I read reviews online and they said to stick it out, so I did. So far, it&#039;s been a great help. I feel more in control of my life and my thoughts. I have read a lot of reviews about this medicine causing weight gain so I&#039;m worried about that, as my birth control does that enough. So far this is working well with me but everyone should remember we are all different and this medicine will work differently for everyone."
