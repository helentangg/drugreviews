"Lexapro is a double edged sword for me. I can finally live, now that I have it, free of anxiety. However, I can no longer live without it. I have tried numerous times to wean, all to no avail. So far after about 6 years of use, my labworks are still all fine and normal. Hopefully this will never change."
