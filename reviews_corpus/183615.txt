"I took this drug for a couple years. At first I was very tired all the time but that passed. It did help with the anxiety for the first 6 months or so but I always had the brain zaps everyone talks about. They were very frustrating and after the 6 months it was not effective. I didn&#039;t like the way I felt and quit taking it."
