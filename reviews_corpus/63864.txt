"I got prescribed sertraline 25 mg back in April. I take one a day to ease my bipolar disorder and anxiety. At first, it helped some but felt like I could really go higher on dose to be more effective but I wanted to try mixing other natural supplements to work synergistically. I would take turmeric daily, and eventually drink apple cider vinegar as well. At some point in the last month, either the effects of sert had worn off or the apple cider vinegar screwed up my mental health. I have quit sert for about a week and I feel crappy!!! I take fish oil, turmeric, 5htp, choline inositol, multivitamins and jeez idk what is ruining my mind, actual withdrawal or these sups. I feel worthless and guilty it&#039;s crazy and I wish I knew what causes it!"
