"I&#039;m male, 59, suffer from anxiety and panic attacks. It took a month for this medicine to kick in.  STICK WITH IT. I sweated like anything at night for the first 3 weeks but that stopped. I wake up briefly at 3:00 or 4:00 am (A side effect) BUT it is totally worth it. Previously I had knots, big suckers, in my stomach for nearly a year. I used to worry and then look for things to worry about and then initiate my flow chart of worry. No more. A positive side effect is Lexapro. Can also impact/stop obsessive compulsive disorder behaviors too (like counting this and counting that) I also was under-weight forever and have gained weight. A negative is a diminished ability to ejaculate - but again -so what."
