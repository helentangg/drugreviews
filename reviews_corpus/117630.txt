"I have been taking Pamelor for close to 4 years now. After a coiling procedure for an inoperable brain aneurism, I suffered constant migraines. The doctor who performed the coiling did not offer any solution, but a local neurologist in my home town prescribed it for me. It changed what was to be my new life of pain into a much more tolerable existence. A little dizziness is easy to live with. I take 50 mg every morning. Life is good again!"
