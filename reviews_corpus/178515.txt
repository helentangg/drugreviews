"I have been on anti-depressants for 6 years now after a car accident.  This is the third time my medication has been changed because they stopped working.  I take wellbutrin in the morning and cymbalta at night.  The only side effects I have had is increased sweating.  I sleep much better at night, used to just about fall asleep on my way to work - now I am much more awake, much calmer and loving it.  Hopefully this will keep working because I get to the point where I can&#039;t stand myself."
