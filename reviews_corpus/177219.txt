"I&#039;ve been in constant pain from osteoarthritis with some fibromyalgia on top of it for about two years and began taking cymbalta about 6+ weeks ago.  I&#039;ve been pain free for a month now with no need for any painkillers (I was taking a vicoden and tramadol  every day during that time).  Truly a miraculous recovery.  Interestingly my doctor told me that his wife who had bad osteoarthritis pain had the same result from the cymbalta.  Hope that it continues!"
