"I&#039;ve only been taking this tablet for one week so far. Sadly for me my problems of panic and anxiety have became so much worse. Causing me to now have to take a beta blocker. I&#039;m still on citalopram and my beta blockers and will see my doctors next week to see what I need to do. I will update you again."
