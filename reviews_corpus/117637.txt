"I have had Irritable Bowel Syndrome for 30 years and it has gradually gotten so bad that I told my doctor that I could no longer have a normal life and I hated what irritable bowel syndrome was doing to me. He prescribed 10mg of nortriptyline and I highly doubted it would help. I was already on another antidepressant. However, it helped so much...it is a God send! I can now enjoy life again. I can eat! I am not worrying about how I am going to get through the day with stomach pain. I can make plans to do things. I can enjoy my family and work again."
