"Been taking Brintellix for 2 weeks and so far feeling pretty good. I&#039;m a little worried about the weight gain and the price. I finally find something that works for me and it causes these side affects and ridiculous how pricey it is to feel normal! Sad to know that if I can&#039;t afford it or it puts weight on me that I&#039;m going to have to stop taking a drug that actually helps! I work out 4 days a week and had lost 22 lbs but I&#039;ve gained 4 in 2 weeks.Not acceptable! I will continue taking for another 2 weeks and see what happens!"
