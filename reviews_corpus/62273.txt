"I like it. Does have some persistent annoying side effects but, the pros far outweigh the cons. Started out with 10mg for one month. Bumped up to 20mg for the past 2 months. Much more sociable, in fact, I feel like I don&#039;t want to be alone now. Dressing better, super giggly, it feels great to laugh it off. And almost every other user reports loss of sex drive which makes me wonder why I feel so, quite the opposite of that all the time. Cons: brain zaps, shortness breath sometimes, dazey, shakey, sweaty, if I miss dose I feel cynical and don&#039;t like anyone because I think they are all rude. Paranoid? Weight gain. Still like it."
