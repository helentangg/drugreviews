"My doctor put me on Cymbalta for Fibromyalgia, and I have to say that it was really effective at reducing my pain, helping me sleep, and clearing up the brain fog. HOWEVER, I began having some side effects that became serious when my doctor increased my dosage - being clumsy, hot all the time &amp; sweating profusely, and agitation bordering on hypomania. I also noticed my blood pressure seemed to be high - around 150/94 - which was unusual for me. The last straw was the day my blood pressure went up to 170/120. Turns out that the Vyvanse I take for ADHD plus the Cymbalta caused Serotonin Syndrome. Then had horrible withdrawal coming off of it. Make sure your medicines won&#039;t interact before starting Cymbalta!"
