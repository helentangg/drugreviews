"I previously took Celexa for GAD; but it stopped working. Switched to Paxil. Paxil is great for anxiety but it gave me constant nausea that wouldn&#039;t go away. I switched to Prozac. The first 2 weeks on Prozac, it gave me more anxiety, nausea and unable to eat a lot. After two weeks, my anxiety/panicky was reduced, appetite is good again and sometimes I will get bouts of nausea. So far, Prozac at 40 is working pretty good. I also take Valium 5 mg as needed once or twice a week.  Valium is amazing. When Prozac is not working well on certain days, Valium is used to smooth things out.  Valium is a good rx since it will stay in our system for a longer time. If you use it scarcely, you can use Valium for life. Prozac &amp; Valium: Excellent together."
