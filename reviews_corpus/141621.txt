"This medicine truly saved my life, my job, my relationship with friends and more. I have suffered with GAD, prementrual despotic disorder, worrying constantly, on and off for over 20 years. When I felt great life was wonderful I could do 100 things at once but when depression hit I was totally disabled couldn&#039;t work, shut myself off from the world and just wanted to sink away. I started Lexapro and within 2 weeks I could get out of bed. After 30 days I had absolutely no side affects and felt amazing!"
