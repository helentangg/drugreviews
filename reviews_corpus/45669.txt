"I had suffered from anxiety for years, but was hesitant to try Prozac.  As I got older, my anxiety got worse.  I started having panic attacks on a regular basis, and it was getting harder for me to plan normal activities.  I finally asked my therapist to put me on an anti-depressant.  We decided on fluoxetine.

The first two months were VERY difficult for me.  I had every side-effect in the book.   But I hung in there, as my doctor said to give it two months.

Around 7 or 8 weeks, the side-effects subsided, and since then, my life has been SO much better.  I haven&#039;t had a panic attack in a year.  Little annoyances roll off my back.  But I&#039;m still me.

My advice is give it time.  It can be a frustrating journey, but well worth it in the end."
