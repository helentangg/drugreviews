"I never realized I had OCD until I saw a therapist after having my baby... my whole like I was labeled as &quot;high strung&quot; and to be honest I didn&#039;t believe the therapist when she diagnosed me. After a long and agonizing series of events I reluctantly started lexapro 10mg (didn&#039;t believe in taking meds). After 3 weeks I could not believe how much more relaxed I felt.I never realized how severe my panic and anxiety was until I got to experience life without it. My rituals even subsided (never knew I had rituals until I stopped doing them) In the end I am glad I started the meds. Only side effect has been decreased sex drive, but it&#039;s manageable and both myself and my husband are much happier now that I can function better and enjoy daily life."
