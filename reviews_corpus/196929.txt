"O M G   Where has this drug been my whole life?    I have only been on it for little over a week and already I am feeling &quot;more than functional&quot;!   So functional in fact that I am re-enrolling into school and getting my drivers license back. I feel like there&#039;s hope for me and i do in fact have a future, and people who love me.   

like i said, i&#039;ve only been on it for over a week.  I hope this keeps rolling the way it is now!
but definitely 10/10


Other drugs I have tried that were NOT helpful:   zoloft, escotalopram, effexor.  Not saying you should disregard them though. i&#039;m supposing that different drugs help different people for different reasons. *shrug"
