"Zoloft has been hard for me. At first it was okay (besides the side effects, those were brutal) but now that I&#039;ve been on it for almost 2 years, im starting to forget things and my mindset is never balanced. Some days are okay, but some days I&#039;m panicky, shaky, can&#039;t remember much even if it happened less than a minute ago, and my depression starts back up. I really don&#039;t wanna move on to another medication because the withdraws of this medication is as brutal as the side effects but i feel like Zoloft isn&#039;t a long term drug for me."
