"Lexapro 10mg helped me SO much. In June of 2016, my dad passed away unexpectedly. I&#039;m 24 and a female. My life was turned upside down and I could not deal. I was a &quot;normal&quot; person w/o anxiety before this now I was experiencing chronic anxiety-panic attacks, mind racing, feelings of derealization, etc..It was chronic. I couldn&#039;t go to work and could barely even leave the house without having crippling anxiety. I tapered up from 5mg to 10mg over a few months and it literally saved me. I still had a few symptoms but nothing any different than just every day mild anxiety. It felt liberating. Lexapro 10mg saved my life."
