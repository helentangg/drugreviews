"I took Cymbalta for the first time last night. Within an hour I was falling asleep on the couch, which I never do. Usually I have insomnia, but I slept through the night. However, when I woke up I was violently nauseous and had to take an anti nausea medication (which I sometimes use when my anxiety is really bad cause it makes me sick). I attempted to go about my normal day, but found myself having to take two naps because I was excessively tired. I&#039;ve been watching and reading about this medication all day and I am terrified to take another dose because of the side effects and ultimate withdrawal I&#039;ll experience if it doesn&#039;t work out. I noticed today, through my headache and tiredness that I felt more calm. I&#039;m praying it works for me!"
