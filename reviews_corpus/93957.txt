"I have been on trintellix for over a year. I don&#039;t think it is the best medication I have been on (I have tried several), but it certainly helps. I do experience side effects if I miss a dose, especially for longer than 48 hours. I usually get very headachey and itchy, everywhere. Maybe this is a good sign, as it indicates maybe it does something. I don&#039;t feel very drastic, life-altering relief, but I do believe that if I weren&#039;t taking it, things would be much worse. I don&#039;t think you feel the support it provides in a strong way, but in a more subtle, long-term way."
