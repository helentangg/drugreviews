"I am a 49-year old female and have been on Lexapro for about 7 months.  I can&#039;t believe how much it has changed my life - I am so happy now!  I take 5 MG per day (1/2 a pill) - more than that at once upsets my stomach.  I had tried Paxil before and it was awful.  Lexapro has given me my life back."
