"I have been on this medication since last February, so almost two years. 
Wow, what a wonderful change it has made for me. I am so indebted and thank God so much that these medications are now available and are helping to make lives better.
I had severe OCD, crying spells daily due to the overwhelming constancy of the anxiety, heart palpitating constantly, I was a mess on the inside. I never felt at peace even though I tried many things to help feel more calmed. I am 21 years of age.I am now so at peace, I notice that when the OCD comes, which it still does, the overwhelming anxiety is not there anymore. I have less fear of the future. It&#039;s a miracle for me.
Side effects: Weight gain/sex drive/sleepy. I was 145 pounds and now I am 175 pound"
