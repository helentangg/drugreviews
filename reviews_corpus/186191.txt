"Dr put me on pristiq because I was having a bad time dealing with the loss of a loved one. It&#039;s my first medication and have been on it for 9 months, Although it has relieved my mild anxiety I have decided that this or any other medication isnt for me.The weight gain has pprobably been the worst and only side effect for me, after 3 months I piled on 10kgs. On my pharmacists advice I have been lowering my dose on alternate days and am now on my third day without taking it. I feel like im a little tipsy/heavy headed by the end of the day and that&#039;s all so far but is bareable and I still manage to go about my day as normal, hopefully this doesn&#039;t last long. I have never experienced brain zaps either"
