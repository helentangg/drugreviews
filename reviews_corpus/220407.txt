"I have fibromyalgia and take Tramadol 150mg daily. Recently had a flare of trigeminal neuralgia and widespread neuropathic pain and Tramadol was not working for this.  Doctor put me back onto Endep, which I had given up previously as the side effects were very strong.  Am now on only 5mg at 7pm and find sleep and pain relief much better.  Still feel hungover in the morning."
