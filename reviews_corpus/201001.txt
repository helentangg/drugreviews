"I&#039;m a 29 year old female. I&#039;ve been suffering from horrible social anxiety disorder and panic attacks for over 2 years.  I&#039;ve been on Zoloft (technically sertraline since I&#039;m on the generic version) for 4 months. The first 2-3 weeks I started with 25 mg and I had mild side effects like diarrhea and dizziness. I also spaced out a lot. After the 3 week mark the side effects started to go away and I felt so much better than I ever had in years. I had little to no social anxiety anymore and almost felt like I had my life back. After 2 months I felt I plateaued. I started getting the anxiety/panicky feelings back. So I upped my dosage to 50 mg. For now it is still doing the trick but it&#039;s nowhere near what it was in the beginning."
