"I have fibromyalgia and was in pain with body aches my Dr and I decided to use Cymbalta. I started at 30mg for a week then up to 60mg. The first day I felt a little strange I had no idea what it was the second day was worse and I wanted to stop taking it, so I found a site that talked about Cymbalta and Fibromyalgia most reviews said push through keep taking it you will be glad you did. I decided to keep taking the Cymbalta day three still felt strange but the pain was less 
Because I wasn&#039;t sure I did the 30mg for 2weeks until I felt comfortable then I went to 60mg. I haven&#039;t felt this good in a very  long time almost like I don&#039;t have Fibromyalgia But I missed a dose and the pain was unbearable. I won&#039;t do that again. I love Cymbalta"
