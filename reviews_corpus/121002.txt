"Effexor
I have tried many drugs but found that &quot;in my case&quot; they are not necessary.  I went for an ultrasound on my carotid vein.  The doctors said the flow was in the normal range but you could see that they were narrow. I went out of country to have them widened... No more anxiety and depression....drugs are cheaper and more profitable than minor surgery.  I will return for stents.
