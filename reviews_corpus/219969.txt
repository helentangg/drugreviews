"I am a mother of 3 kids 33 and have anxiety/depression  I was on Effexor 150 mg &quot; this should be illegal! &quot; didn&#039;t work and If a dose was missed it felt like few hours of a drug &quot;rush&quot; like speed or cocaine...intense night sweats highly addictive AVOID! , Celexa
 &quot; had bad sexual side effects&quot;, zoloft &quot;robot drug&quot;. I am getting back to Elavil 10 mg.  Elavil is great I feel happy on it . It makes me enjoy life and little things again. I don&#039;t  need to take much for it to work and I have no side effects at all on a  10 mg daily dose. I felt sleepy for two weeks when I started but it resorbs and you can then feel its full beneficial effects quickly general  mood elevation and good feeling&quot;. Anxiety is under control on it and I sleep better."
