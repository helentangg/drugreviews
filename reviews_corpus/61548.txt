"Since 2007, I&#039;ve taken Lexapro in varying doses from 10 - 40 mg. Now 2017, I believe it no longer worked as it once did. My Psychiatrist had mentioned Celexa to me, explaining it&#039;s basically the same compound construction but ONE Molecule. I  have marked Depression, but also suffer from Stress, Anxiety, Post-traumatic Stress, some OCD tendencies, ADHD &amp; sleep issues. I have been on 20 mg of this, Celexa, now for over a week and immediately, within 2-3 days, felt the difference, in a great way! My body is extremely sensitive to certain types of Psych meds. My body also metabolizes medications differently from season to season. I believe at the right dose of this, Celexa, I will be able to come off of the 2mg of Clonazepam. Give it time!"
