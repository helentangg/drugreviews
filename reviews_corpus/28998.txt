"Saved my life. I used to take 20 mg two years ago. I ended up taking myself off, (tapering) then I was fine for about 6 months. I fell into a relapse and now started on 10 mg. I would be so afraid of what to eat and if something was going to make my blood sugar to high. Now I can eat healthy but not have to worry that to much fruit will make me sick. I can have a soda every now and then. I love Lexapro. The first few days are different, headache, stomach ache and dizziness. Now I feel 100% better."
