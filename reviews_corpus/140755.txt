"I have only been on lexapro for 3 weeks now but I can say that it has truly helped me make it through everyday amazingly. I read all of these reviews as I contemplated taking it. And I can assure you it will help. I only had slight side effects on the first day, like dry mouth and feeling a little spacey. But it passed fast and has taken away almost all of my panic attacks. If you are really having trouble making it day to day, please at least try it. It was immensely worth it for me and I really hope it can help you too."
