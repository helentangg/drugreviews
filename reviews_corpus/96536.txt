"For years I suffered migraines and I swore they were menstrual related and no one believed me until finally a nurse practitioner discussed Prementrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) with me.  My severe moods and migraines were relieved as long as I stayed on Zoloft.  PMDD is worse than PMS and I find not as easily diagnosed.  I have been having more migraines lately but I am not sure if I have missed doses or need to increase.  Zoloft has definitly helped me."
