"I have been on escitalopram for 10 years, I am in full blown menopause, and my anxiety and depression has increased, the doc has put me on sertraline 50mg, I&#039;m on day 4 and feel sick and keep having bouts of tearfulness, just wandering how long it has took for this to pass, I hate having this all over again"
