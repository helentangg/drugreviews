"I have been on Zoloft for just over a year. I take 75-100 mg daily. I&#039;m definitely more comfortable in social situations. My only complaints are drowsiness and not really having ANY emotions. It did help a lot when I was downsized. I&#039;m still looking for a job but it seems to help with anxieties associated with job interviews. People say I&#039;m a HAPPY person now."
