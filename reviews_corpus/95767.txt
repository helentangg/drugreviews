"It&#039;s my third time returning back to Zoloft and I&#039;m 21. First time I&#039;ve used Zoloft I was only 15 and it was for Social Anxiety/Severe Depression and it helped me tremendously. Stopped it after one year and maybe... 6 months later my anxiety was back along with obsessive compulsive disorder.

Anyway, I&#039;m back on it and after 1 month I can say this IT&#039;S PERFECT. I&#039;m lucky to not have any side effects (except maybe a little bit of diziness but I don&#039;t care) and I feel so much better!!! 

I&#039;m way LESS ANXIOUS, OCD is diminished by 3/4 (I still need to follow therapy for this problem), no more black thoughts, I&#039;m also more focused at school and my thoughts are more coherent/clear. 

I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll ever stop this medication... For me, it&#039;s a life saver."
