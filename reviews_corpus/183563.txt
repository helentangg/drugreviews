"My mother started taking this medicine to help with her fibromyalgia and depression. A few weeks after she started taking it, she developed pain and stiffness (a rare side effect) in her right calf. (This was different from her fibromyalgia pain. Blood clots and various other problems were ruled out with dozens of visits to doctors).  She stopped taking the medicine but withdrawal was bad. Her doctor was of no help and was ignorant of the withdrawal effects. She still suffers from effects of withdrawal although most days are better than they were. However she still has immense pain in her leg and finally a doctor discovered that she had actual muscle damage. "
