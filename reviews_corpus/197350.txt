"I took Paxil for 5 years following the death of my father. I suppose I&#039;ve always felt moderately uncomfortable in size able groups and after my dad passed I was also very down in the dumps. Paxil helped immediately and made me way more sociable than ever before. I had confidence to say what I wanted to say and clearer thoughts than I&#039;ve ever had. I&#039;ve now been off for 4 months and am struggling again with the same issues. I&#039;ve tried turning to herbal remedies like rhodiola, St johns wort, 5-HTP, and fish oil. Together they make me feel alright I guess but it&#039;s just not the same. If it weren&#039;t for the sexual side effects, I wouldn&#039;t hesitate to get back on Paxil but I&#039;d like to get my wife pregnant soon so this is not an immediate option."
