"Cymbalta is a god send for me and all those people out there who suffer from depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, diabetic nerve damage, fibromyalgia, pain or what ever else it is used for. I myself have s. A. D [social anxiety disorder] and at times depression. I was taking zoloft and I still felt the anxiety so my doctor prescribed cymbalta and it took about a week 2 actually kick in and when it did I felt it and loved it and would recommend this medication to those who are trying to find a way to help them live there life with ease. It&#039;s not a cure but it is very helpful as long as you take it when you are supposed to. Cymbalta is the best. Thanks."
