"I tried this medication between Cymbalta and Trintellix.  Cymbalta did not eliminate my anxiety and caused stomach issues for me.

Viibryd&#039;s half life is short.  For whatever reason, I would have discontinuation effects late in the cycle.  Taking in half 2x/day helped, but seemed to weaken the effect of the drug.

Bottom line for me was that while it worked at 40mg part of the day, the end of the day would be very difficult, with brain zaps and lethargy.  If you have this experience like I did you simply may metabolize the drug too fast to take advantage of it properly.  It is unfortunate because other effects of the drug -- digestive, libido, etc -- were quite good."
