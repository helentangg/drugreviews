"I had panic attaches and anxiety for more than 5 months until I started on escitalopram. 
if feel much better after 2 weeks. i am still on this medication since 4 months a go. the Dr recommended to stay on this med for 1 to 1.5 year. i highly recommend this med to people with medium to severe anxiety and panic disorders.
What I also realized that my headaches nearly gone and i started eating and living well as i have not had any anxiety before."
