"I&#039;m 21 years old and have been suffering from chronic abdominal pain and Irritable Bowel Syndrome for almost two years now. I started the nortriptyline about a year ago after countless trips to the hospital to get a grip on my pain. Since last summer, I&#039;ve noticed a HUGE difference since being on the nortriptyline. There is still some pain, but the medicine really calmed everything down. The only thing that I frown upon is the fact that it makes me very tired. Even though I take it at bedtime. I take 75mg every night and I wake up feeling groggy every day. I&#039;m not sure if anyone else has had this experience and side effect. But I&#039;d rather be tired than in pain, good luck to everyone!"
