"Hi,

I was taking Citalopram and had the initial doses there from 10 to 20 to 30mg for GAD. I&#039;m not sure what triggered the anxiety but alcohol definitely makes it worse. I hated Citalopram as it often left me lethargic, and made my anxiety worse. I have been on Sertraline for about 6 weeks and I did notice an initial improvement but now I feel like my anxiety is taking its toll again. I am currently taking 50mg but I&#039;m unsure whether to increase to 100mg or switch to a different SSRI. Please can people share their views with me? I&#039;m a 24 year old male and I&#039;m eager to get on with life, but it just feels like my anxiety is the elephant in the room.

Thank you in advance and good luck everyone."
