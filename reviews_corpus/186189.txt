"I started Pristiq 2 years ago and have been on risperidone for about 20 years.  These two drugs have kept me feeling quite fuzzy and warm. There is not much that I can&#039;t tackle in a day. I am like Teflon when it comes to negativity. 100 mg a day. No worries. I have lost about 30 lbs and have quit smoking after 20 yrs. Pristiq has been my wonder drug. I don&#039;t plan on stopping this medication anytime soon."
