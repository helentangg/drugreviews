"My experience with amitriptyline I take 20mg in the evening, and it helps my pain tremendously. I can&#039;t take Lyrica, gabipenton due to edema side effects. My only complaint is that I can&#039;t wake up! It&#039;s causing problems with my marriage, and other family relationships. It&#039;s catch 20/20. Do I take only medication that allows me to function on daily basis with my chronic pain,or live in pain to maintain family relationships.  : /"
