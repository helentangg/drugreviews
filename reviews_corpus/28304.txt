"I&#039;ve found a lot of these posts quite encouraging.  I started taking Lexapro 6 to 8 years ago - 20mg and definitely felt it was a miracle for that entire 6 to 8 years.  I was really stressed and couldn&#039;t concentrate at work.  Sure, I still had stresses, but they didn&#039;t seem to be unmanageable. I was probably doing a little &#039;too&#039; fine because I tried to get off of it about 3 months ago because I want to see if I could actually go without medicines.  BIG MISTAKE!!  A couple of life stressers recently popped up and sent my anxiety into overdrive.  I immediately called my Dr. to get my prescription refilled.  Currently on day 4 and battling anxiety and insomnia, but hopeful that the magic will return soon! I think I&#039;m a lifer on this medicine!"
