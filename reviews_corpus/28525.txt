"I took Lexapro for 5-6 years started with 10 mg then eventually increased to 30 mg. It worked great for helping me keep calm, and helped my depression and was able to deal with stress, however the more I had to increase the dose the more tired I got, and I eventually got to a point I just could not function, it took everything I had just to get out of bed then maybe 2 hrs later I was ready for a 3-4 hour nap. My doctor then switched me back to 10mg and added Wellbutrin that worked good together but when I had to increase the dose of Lexapro I got to where I couldn&#039;t function again. Lexapro is a good medication at a low dose."
