"This is the 5th week that I have been on this medicine. I have been diagnosed with PTSD as a result of a traumatic incident 1 1/2 years ago.  I have suffered with depression for most of my adult life. I have had extreme nausea, weight loss which I do not need.  The worst thing has been the &quot;extreme&quot; anger and aggression I have been feeling. I have started swearing all the time, which is not me.  I cry at the drop of a hat. I don&#039;t have children but I feel like hitting my pets at times. I would never hurt my pets but these feelings scare me. I have recently stopped taking it. It may be a miracle drug for some but for me it&#039;s been a nightmare."
