"I read all the reviews and still thought I could beat the odds and it &quot;might&quot; work for me. The first day of taking it I was so shaky, nauseous, and it made me even more depressed than usual. I am not on any other meds so I figured I would try this first since my doctor just kept recommending it to me. NEVER AGAIN!!! Even if you think your that 1 in a million who won&#039;t get the side effects don&#039;t risk it!! There&#039;s so many others out there to try it&#039;s not even worth the one day of being suicidal and miserable"
