"I have been taking Cymbalta for 3 weeks for Peripheral Neuropathy, a painful disease that hasn&#039;t responded to any other meds. It blocks the pain signals to the brain and works wonderfully. I have about an 80% reduction in pain and rarely need a pain med. It also helps my mood and reduces my appetite. No side effects. It&#039;s great! On another note:NEVER go off an antidepressant cold turkey! It can be a nightmare. Work with your doctor to taper off slowly &amp; safely."
