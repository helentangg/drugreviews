"I have suffered 25 to 35 hot flashes day and night, heavily for around 2 years it has affected my quality of life in every way. 
My work uniform saturated. Then in winter I get chills after the flashes that last up to four to five minutes.  Sometimes just over. 
Anyway I asked the doc a few days ago for small dose of prozac. 
I feel odd for sure. But not to bad. My triggers that I know of are smoking, tea, coffee, soda, icecream, chocolate...spices, etc. Everything I love. 
Anyway I cut back on smokes and soda. Cut out heaps of spices.
This is day 2 of 10mg of prozac. 
Will keep updating this thread.

Now day 6.
Flashes have become shorter and less intense.
I&#039;m having maybe 4 at night. Compared to 12 to 15.
Through the day maybe 6.."
