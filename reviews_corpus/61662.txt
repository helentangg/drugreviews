"I was very depressed after experiencing loss of two family members within 2 weeks. Started citalopram 10mg once a day for a week then went to 20 mg once a day. 
The first week, there was no change in me. The second week was much better. I was always a quiet , non talkative person but now I speak a lot more and am more sociable (which I don&#039;t really care to be) but considering the alternative...
This drug definitely helped with the depression. I&#039;ve only been on it a little over 3 weeks now. I did experience side effects such as headaches, not being able to fall asleep, and I&#039;m very jumpy...a small noise or whatever will startle me. But I&#039;ll gladly put up with those for the relief this drug has given me."
