"I started taking Cymbalta in April 2011, and when I first started out on it I experienced, extreme tiredness, insomnia, dry mouth, constipation, hot flashes, strange dreams. I still get very odd sometimes disturbing dreams but I think a lot of it has to do with recent stresses in my life (grandma having a stroke, work stress) and still experience constipation, hot flashes, and night sweats but it&#039;s not the end of the world. It has so far been the only antidepressant medication that has really helped me and I have been on lots of different SSRI&#039;s and atypical antipsychotics. I have good and bad days like anyone does, but if I do get sad and cry it doesn&#039;t seem to last long. So in my opinion the benefits outweigh the side effects."
