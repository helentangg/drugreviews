"I have been on 20mg amitriptyline for some years now due to really bad insomnia. I don&#039;t really know if it works as some nights I sleep ok and others hardly at all. However never felt groggy in morning nor had a dry mouth (unlike when I have taken  zopliclone and other sleeping pills). This week for example has been awful. Every night hardly slept a wink. So went docs yday and he said to increase dosage up to 50mg. Took 40mg last night and will see how that goes. Insomnia is just the worst thing ever, really envy those people who can sleep on a washing line!"
