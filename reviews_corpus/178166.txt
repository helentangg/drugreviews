"Took Cymbalta and for a few weeks. It seems to help with the pains of fibromyalgia but I had hot flashes that got so bad it made me crazy. Also my fiber fog got really worse, I couldn&#039;t concentrate anymore and forget sleep, to hot to do that. I finally gave up after 9 weeks and stopped cold turkey. No sleep for a few days but now after 2 weeks back to myself. I guess Cymbalta is not for me."
