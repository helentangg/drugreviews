"On my 14th day of sertraline and I finally see the light at the end of the tunnel. Admittedly the first week was pretty terrible, it worsened my depression and anxiety quite alot but now that&#039;s eased, I feel wonderful! I was in such a state before, nothing made sense - I literally couldn&#039;t enjoy anything. I finally feel like I&#039;m going to get my life back, and can once again enjoy the sun on my face."
