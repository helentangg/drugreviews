"At first, I thought this medicine was working. I&#039;ve been on every antidepressant known to man. Nothing ever worked. So my doctor gave me a sample pack. When I hit the 40 mg mark, I started have the &quot;brain zaps.&quot; They are very real. Very frightening. One night I thought I was having a seizure in my sleep from so many zaps. My husband has to hold me down when I finally do fall asleep because my body is constantly moving. The problem is that I&#039;ve been taking the 40 mg for a month and am now just realizing the cause of my &quot;brain zaps&quot; and lack of sleep. So now I have to wean myself off of this drug from the devil himself. I would NEVER EVER recommend this drug to anyone. Nothing good came from it. Nothing at all."
