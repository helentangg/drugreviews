"My anxiety got to the point where treatment wasn&#039;t an option, I had to try something. I gave Lexapro a chance. Its been good for me. The drug has slowed down my anxiety. I feel less anxious around people and in general I feel like my internal monologue has slowed down a bit. I&#039;ve noticed when I&#039;m around people I&#039;m less reactive whereas before I was jumpy and unsettled. 

I am on 10mg. About a decade ago I tried zoloft and effexor both with mixed results. Currently I take Lexapro and Adderall. It seems to be a good combo for me. There have been some side effects. My sleep is disrupted at times, I have trouble reaching orgasm and sometimes I feel a bit lethargic. This drug is working well for me, I hope it continues to be effective."
