"I take Elavil for migraines and have not had a single headache since starting it. Elavil also makes me sleep wonderfully. I (and everyone in my family) have always had trouble sleeping, and I didn&#039;t think there was a medicine out there that would make me sleep on a reliable schedule. This is amazing.

Negatives: Miss a dose and you&#039;ll have a bad migraine. It makes you extremely drowsy for the first week, but that will pass. I keep a bottle of water by my bed because of the dry mouth. Cravings is a side effect so if you get them you should monitor your diet to avoid weight gain. Also I drank half a beer after taking it and felt like I&#039;d drank 15. Approach alcohol use VERY carefully."
