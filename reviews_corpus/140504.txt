"I&#039;ve been taking 10mgs for two weeks now, the panic attacks are crazy getting them as soon as I wake up and twice as bad. Now my Dr upped me to 20mgs I went through hell when I started now I&#039;m going through it all over again. With my brain feeling like it&#039;s jelly feeling like I&#039;m going crazy and shaking so bad. I freaked out and called the hospital as they told me don&#039;t quit it&#039;s just side affects and stick it out. But thinking I&#039;m just going to stick to the 10mgs and hope the panic attacks will go away but with the higher dose I feel a panic attack starting and it goes away as soon as I feel it started"
