"I&#039;m currently 18 and I have been on paxil for a few months, it&#039;s my first try on an SSRI or any medication for anxiety. It works really well, I&#039;m on 20mg and its not that I&#039;m never anxious but my life feels liveable and that&#039;s what matters to me. Despite at first always being super sleepy it was nothing compared to thinking wow this is how life is mostly supposed to be like. For me it works, but falling asleep a lot was poo,and there are still certain triggers that I still don&#039;t/can&#039;t stand but its much better now. Please note people that you don&#039;t just quit an SSRI! You have to talk to a doctor on getting off of it or else your brain will be like what is going on. Thus the side effects of withdrawal and so on."
