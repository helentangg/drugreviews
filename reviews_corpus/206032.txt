"As others have described I have seen a huge change after the first 2 doses.  Recent emotional and mental stress along with going through menopausal changes threw me completely off balance. My doctor prescribed Pristiq and I cannot believe the huge change. My head is so clear and balanced, I feel like the slate has been wiped clean. My eyesight also feels clear.  I suppose that is because my brain is in better balance.  I believe this to be a wonderful improvement on this type of anti-depressant and I will continue to take it for as long it helps.  The only side effect I have is slight nausea which should subside in a week."
