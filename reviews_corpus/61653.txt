"After toughing it out with anxiety for many years I went to a Dr,. he prescribed Paxil I took it and it increased my problems 10 times. I never went back so I&#039;ve lived with anxiety with the help of kolonopin up until 6 months ago when I couldn&#039;t take the 3 am panic attacks anymore and the daytime paranoia, &quot; OMG what if anything happens&quot;
My new Dr. prescribed Celexa, I took 10mg and couldn&#039;t sleep for 3 nights, I went back to the Dr.
and he reduced the dosage to 2.5 mg. Within three nights the panic attacks stopped  and I could sleep. I went back again and we increased it to 5 mg.Three months later increased it back to 10 mg.We will see where this all goes, but I do feel better and plan to stick with this Dr. and this medication."
