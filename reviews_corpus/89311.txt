"I (VERY reluctantly) began 10 mg of Celexa (for anxiety) for a week, then 20 mg for the next week, and now I&#039;ve been on 30 mg for a few weeks now. I had anxiety about taking  the anti-anxiety meds!  Honestly, the first week was AWFUL. My anxiety was heightened, I couldn&#039;t sleep, bad headaches and felt like something was tickling my brain. By the second week, those side effects were gone. 

My anxiety was resulting in constant physical dizziness, floor &quot;bouncing&quot; (feeling like you&#039;re on  a boat/elevator when you&#039;re just walking around), racing thoughts, sleeping just to avoid it all, etc. My dizziness is mostly disappeared, and usually the floor feels like it should. PLEASE DON&#039;T BE SCARED! It can be a lifesaver."
