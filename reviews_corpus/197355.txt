"I have been taking Paxil 20mg for about 4 months now. I suffered with anxiety which caused lightheadedness and shortness of breath for two years before I decided to try medication.  When I first started, I had more anxiety than ever and some depression which I never had before taking this medication. It took about six weeks to feel the effects and it works. To those out there struggling with this medication just give it the 6-8 weeks to work before giving up. Also, try relaxing things like baths and reading and even exercise.  I finally feel like myself again. I have some rare moments of anxiety but nothing at all like I had before seeking help. This is a good medication."
