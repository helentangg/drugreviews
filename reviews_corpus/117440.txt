"It took four months before I could titrate up from 50mg to 75mg.  I&#039;m on it for Dysautonomia, nuerolgia, fibromyalgia, depression. At that point I felt significant improvement from the depression and panic attacks. I weaned myself off at one point for fear that I was having a bad side effect. I had forgotten how much pain relief it provided until I was off of it. This is one of the most helpful medications I&#039;ve ever taken! It helps with pain, dysautonomia and depression! I don&#039;t think it gives me bad side effects. I&#039;ve had serious bad side effects from SSRI&#039;s so I was very nervous but had to try something. I&#039;m also on Gabapentin which helps with sleep and pain but coupled with this drug I&#039;ve done so much better."
