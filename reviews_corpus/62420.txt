"I take citalopram for PMDD.  I only take it when I have the PMS symptoms and it works great.  I haven&#039;t had any side effects.  I just had the doctor put my daughter on it because the medicines she was on was not helping her anxiety or irritability related to her Autism.  She&#039;s only been on it for 5 days and we noticed a difference in her almost immediately. It&#039;s amazing! She&#039;s smiling and hugging me and telling me she loves me.  For one Autistic kids don&#039;t hug their moms at least without you asking first and now she wants to hug me.  I love her cheerful mood.  It&#039;s been tough lately with her attitude and now it gives me hope that we&#039;ve found the right medicine to help her."
