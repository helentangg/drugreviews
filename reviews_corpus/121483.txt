"I had a major trauma happen in my life about 11 yrs ago. Although I have been depressed for most of my life I went to the doctor for extra help during this stressful time. My doctor prescribed Effexor XR and I was on 75 milligrams per day and then within the last 4 years to 150 milligrams. I truly do not know what I would do without this medicine. It really has improved my life, my mood and lessens the depression. I too once tried to wean off on my own and it was very emotional time. I will never do that again without my Drs knowledge and help. Effexor xr has changed my life and improved it greatly. I say try it and if it doesn&#039;t work for you, continue to consult with your Dr to find a medicine that helps your depression. Best wishes."
