"I have been on this medication for about a week.  It was prescribed for severe depression (PTSD). I also have severe anxiety attacks that would cause me to have outbursts of anger, nothing physical, but verbal altercations with people. 
The first day I took escitaloprom, I felt totally relaxed and with no signs of anger and anxiety.  I do get sleepy, and feel a little lethargic.  I have been on many different drugs for the same reason, and I now ask why was I not prescribed this medication years ago.  Too early to notice any change in weight gain.  I was able to stop taking my anxiety medicine, and reduced my sleep medication by half. A great medication that is helping me recover from years of useless depression and anxiety."
