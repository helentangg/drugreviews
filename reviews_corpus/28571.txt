"On the 25th I was on day 3 and feeling awful and yes, it was like having a bad flu, vomiting, shakes, anxiety at an all time high because I wanted to feel better and the sickness just made me feel that I never was. But now day 6 and like the first time, I&#039;m glad I stuck with it as I feel just great today and feel &#039;normal&#039; so the side effects are very hard but it is worth it in the end."
