"About 6-8 weeks ago my doc prescribed 10 mg paxil (Now up to 20 mg) &amp; 0.25 Xanax. The first few weeks I was very, very fatigued! But since I was depressed, I was okay with sleeping the rest of the day after returning home from school. I did experience headaches, nausea, increased anxiety (Xanax helped alleviate anxiety). Within the last 2 weeks, I haven&#039;t taken Xanax, my anxiety has dramatically decreased! Depression has also decreased. A few months ago I was scared to leave the house, be around people, an emotional wreck, no motivation to work out. Now I&#039;m happy to go to school, exercise, and be social again. Keep praying and hang in there! "
