"Zoloft saved my life. It&#039;s been like waking up from a life-long nightmare. A lifetime of panic attacks, stress, and anxiety warped my perception of what &#039;normal&#039; was. 

I still feel normal stress and anxiety, but only that which stems from rational causes (car broke down, lost job, etc). There&#039;s no feeling quite like feeling in control of your life and your self again."
