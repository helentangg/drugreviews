"I was diagnosed with GAD and panic disorder three years ago. I have tried ever antidepressant out there. None ever gave me relief except for paxil. I truly credit paxil for saving my sanity, and stopping most of my panic attacks. Although I still have anxiety from time to time, it is nothing I can&#039;t manage. I&#039;ve been taking 40 mgs of paxil for about 9 months. I finally feel like my normal self again."
