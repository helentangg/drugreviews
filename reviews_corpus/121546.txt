"I&#039;ve been on this medicine for going on 5 months now and it&#039;s helped and not helped at the same time, I ran out and the 3 days I was off of it my head started feeling funny and I started feeling sick along with suicidal thoughts it was horrible and now I can&#039;t get off it, my aunt is on it as well and she&#039;s been on it for 20 years her doctor fought to get it off the market for being an addicting drug and potentially harmful as well. But when I&#039;m on it I feel fine for the most part, but if I had to do all over again I would&#039;ve told my Dr to put me on something else."
