"Have been on the Sandoz Citalopram for three months and it has been a Godsend. Virtually immediate effect on depression and reducing anxiety to almost zero after two months. My doctor has encouraged me increase my dose from 20mg up to a max of 40mg per day if I feel like I need the extra cover. My ideal dose at the moment is 30mgs.  Was taking it at night but switched to morning due to some sleeping issues. This drug has given me back my peace of mind and I am so grateful to my doctor for prescribing it."
