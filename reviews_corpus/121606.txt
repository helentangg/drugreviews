"Been on Effexor since July 2014. I take the lower dosage 2x a day as the higher one all at once made me feel sick. I have severe anxiety to the point where i didn&#039;t want to leave the house.   I am also on Ativan for moments i know when i panic...way better than Xanax.  I was on Paxil, Wellbutron...neither worked, made me feel like a zombie.  The only drawback with the Effexor is that I am exhausted!!"
