"Cymbalta has helped me so much with horrible fibromyalgia pain.  It has also helped a great deal with anxiety.  However, I no longer believe I can handle the side effects. I have gained over 20 pounds in less than 4 months, despite exercise and calorie restriction.  I have severe constipation, very odd dreams, and hot flashes.  It is such a shame, because my fibromyalgia is so much better with Cymbalta."
