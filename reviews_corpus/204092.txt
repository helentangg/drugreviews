"I started to suffer from depression and bad anxiety which I&#039;ve never had before, I decided to get help as it was really impacting my life. I started taking escitalopram with the belief that these things don&#039;t work, honestly after 3 days I started to get up and enjoy myself out of the house more, I soon felt like a normal person not over the top happy but certainly not anxious and depressed FAR from it. I had the slightest headache barely worth mentioning, same with being nauseous. The worst part for me was feeling tired but it was easy to over come by taking the tablet at night, which also solves the nausea and headache."
