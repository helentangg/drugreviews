"I had blissfully forgotten how much pain I had been living with before taking Cymbalta, until I ran out unexpectedly. Pretty short half-life. The pain was debilitating and constant; much worse were the very unpleasant withdrawal symptoms which took hold very quickly - won&#039;t list them as they probably were related to my brain trauma. Obviously it&#039;s best not to run out, but if so, be aware of the withdrawal symptoms and pain returning. The good news is that all that unpleasantness is gone relatively quickly: 2-3 days. 
Another point: not covered by my insurance, and I take 90mg/day ($$$), but my G.P. spoke to Lilley (manufacturer) who agreed to provide me with 6 months worth at a time - gratis! Worth checking into."
