"I have been on Pristiq for about 8 months now for depression and still have bad mood swings but do have a boost in my energy level.  I am going to have to discontinue it in the next 2 months because their co-pay program ends and I will have to pay $130.00/month for it.  It&#039;s good but I cannot afford it."
