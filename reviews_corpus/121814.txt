"I was diagnosed with Celiac&#039;s disease 3 years ago although I probably had it for about 7 years. My body didn&#039;t absorb many nutrients so I had anxiety about everything. I am on high doses of B12 and Vit. D and the doctor
thought I should try Effexor.  I first started on a small dose and then she tried me on 75 mg which is still a small dose. This really works for me. I&#039;m not jittery or have negative thoughts.  I&#039;ve only been on this for 6 months but everything seems okay."
