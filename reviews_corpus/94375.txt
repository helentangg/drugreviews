"Was placed on this medication 5 days ago in addition to being on 100 mg trazodone for insomnia. First day was amazing, placebo effect I am sure. After the first day my chest started hurting and I was sleepy and sluggish. I normally am at the gym 6 days per week. I have been once and was so weak feeling I couldn&#039;t push half the weight I normally do and it cut 20 minutes from my lifting time. The last few days I took myself off the trazodone fearing it was what was causing the problem after reading that the two medicines should not be mixed. It didn&#039;t help. I became angry and noticed stiffness in my thighs and neck. I also have been eating everything in sight. This has made me miserable very fast. I start coming off tomorrow."
