"I&#039;ve been taking Lexapro for about 5 months now. They started me at 10 mg and three months ago bumped me up to 20 mg. I&#039;ve struggled with chronic depression for about five or six years now. Used to be a self harmer but with Lexapro things don&#039;t trigger me as much as they used to. Today I missed a dose and honestly feel like totally poop so I was just looking to see if that&#039;s normal. Feel kinda suicidal because I didn&#039;t take it today but that&#039;s pretty normal anyways. I feel like Lexapro is not really a crutch as much as something like Xanax is. I have a prescription for Xanax as well. Would recommend Xanax for anxiety. But I have depression and anxiety, so I need both. Hope this helps. Would definitely recommend Lexapro. I feel tons better."
