"Efexor has been instrumental in controlling my hot flashes and my mood. The only drawback I find is when I have a lapse; besides the hot flashes getting worse; is brain-zaps, they are annoying but I learned that they are not dangerous. Also the generic is not as effective for me as the brand name. I highly recommend it."
