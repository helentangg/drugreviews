"Was taking all kind of pain medicines then my pain doctor put me on the generic of cymbalta ,I could not believe I was not hurting ,I take 60 mg at night just before bed.when I awake in the morning I&#039;m in no pain. And I get better sleep now then I have in a long time .I have degenative disc disease,fibomy,thinning of the bones,bulging disc,sciactic,.they were taking me into the surgery room and giving me injections in my spine ,it helped the right lower back but did nothing for the left side of my back.could hardly get out of bed in the morning. Now everything is much better since I started the cymbalta.I just hope I do not get the side effects they are speaking of so far so good."
