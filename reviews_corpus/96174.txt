"I am 18 years old and have only been on Sertraline for 3 weeks so far but over the last 2 weeks I have seen a drastic improvement in my mood, and anxiety does not have nearly as bad effect on me as it did before. I used to take Citalopram which I just found made me worse, my mood was more irratic, I gained lots of weight and became suicidal. That is why my doctor changed the medication putting me on a 100mg of Sertraline. It has done me the world of good I would never go back. Also it has really decreased my appetite significantly, I can easily get by on one meal a day and have already lost 11lb of the weight I gained on citalopram."
