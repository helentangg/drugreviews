"The physical experience of sertraline is awful, I struggle waking up in the mornings, I have tremors, constant dry mouth, tight jaw muscles, sensitivity to light, difficulty sleeping and horrific spells of heartburn.
The mental effects however are fantastic, I can leave the house with ease, my BPD characteristics are almost none existent apart from the occasional short lived &quot;meltdown&quot; but compared to before I began taking Sertraline are nothing in comparison"
