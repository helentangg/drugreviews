"At first I felt better, but eventually depression was MUCH worse.  (FYI~ do NOT drink alcohol on this med~ the next day I was almost suicidal). The side effects were terrible, ranging from random weird twitches, insomnia, over-eating, diarrhea, to exacerbating my original condition in the first place. Glad it helped some people but it was not for me."
