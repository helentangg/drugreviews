"I started taking Lexapro about 6 years ago for anxiety and social phobia. It worked wonders with few to no apparent side effects. Its not a cure but has helped me manage my condition better than other medications I have tried in the past. It does get me a little sluggish every now and then, but the benefits outweigh the minor side effects. The main down side is the cost. Being that is not covered by insurance and no generic available I&#039;m forced to switch to Celexa. My doctor okayed to try the switch and I&#039;ve read decent reviews by people who use Celexa for anxiety."
