"My experience with Effexor was absolutely terrible. I was prescibed this for my depression (3rd medication I tried) The reason I gave it 2/10 was because I didn&#039;t feel any worse mentally on this (did not feel the slightest bit better either), but if it wasn&#039;t for that I would have given it a 0/10 if possible. The side effects and withdrawal was absolutely terrible. The head &quot;zaps&quot; started to cause unbearable migraines, I had no appetite, and my vision was blurred some days. The withdrawal was something I&#039;ve never experienced before and I hope that I will never have to go through it again. I was completely bed ridden due to the unbearable migraines, sweating, and vomiting. Everyone is different, but this did not work out for me."
