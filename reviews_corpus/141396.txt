"Really helps to stabilize the constant anxiety I&#039;ve experienced before starting this medicine. I&#039;ve noticed that the dose that works best for my generalized anxiety disorder is 20mg, but I&#039;ve also gained 20lbs since starting this medicine despite being active. I&#039;m curious to know what dosage of this medicine has worked for your condition and how you manage the weight gain on this pill."
