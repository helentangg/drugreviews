"I was prescribed 50 mg to start, and went in with an open mind. After one day I decided it wasn&#039;t for me. Maybe 50 mg was too much for me, as I am sensitive to medicine? Anyways, I felt so miserable all day. My head was super foggy and I couldn&#039;t think clearly. I don&#039;t know how to describe other than just feeling so horrible and wanting to feel normal again. I couldn&#039;t do much of anything all day except lay on the floor or bed and feel miserable. I also experienced major TMJ jaw- I wasn&#039;t able to get my jaw to relax. I took a hot shower and almost fainted. It was hard for me to see how this would make me feel better ever, even though I know some people do have success with it. I just couldn&#039;t bring myself to take it again the next day."
