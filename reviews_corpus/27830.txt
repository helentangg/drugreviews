"The reason for my review is in hope that I can convince someone out there who needs help with their anxiety to try this medication. It seriously has been changing my life. It&#039;s only been 2 months and I&#039;m already feeling &quot;normal&quot;. It took a little less than a month for me to really start feeling happier and less anxious. I used to be very negative because of my anxiety. I never wanted to socialize or do anything. I started a new job, which used to be one of my biggest anxiety triggers. But it has been going so well! I&#039;m social and can talk to my coworkers and customers with confidence and my negative thoughts aren&#039;t really there anymore. I&#039;ll admit the side effects the first few weeks were horrible! Just stick it out, I promise it&#039;s worth it."
