"I&#039;ve had anxiety for five years,and started taking Paxil since my first anxiety attack. In all this time I&#039;ve been on Paxil, I only had about 2 to 3 attacks. The problem that I have is feeling dizzy or light-headed since my first attack. It wont go away and it makes me feel tired and lazy. Paxil has helped me with the attacks dramatically, but the light-headedness is still there. "
