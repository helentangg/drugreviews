"After trying around 8 different drugs for my GAD (General Anxiety Disorder) this one seems to be helping.  I don&#039;t want to jump the gun too quick, it&#039;s been a month with a 30mg every other day and about 3 weeks at 30mg a day, but I think it&#039;s working somewhat, still don&#039;t like the idea I have to take it, and always worried about side effects and getting off it, if and when I&#039;m ready.  Have had some bad withdrawal symptoms with some of the others that rivaled getting off pain medicines...no fun!"
