"I have been pretty medicine resistant to most medications, the best medication for me was Zoloft until it lost its effectiveness on me.  I have been on Brintellix for about a month now, was upped to 20mgs last week, and it is just amazing for me. I feel a sense of happiness and hope that I haven&#039;t felt in a long time, I really didn&#039;t see as much improvement until the medication was upped to 20 mgs, then so far it has been awesome, I have had no side effects other than the first few days I was a little antsy and lightheaded."
