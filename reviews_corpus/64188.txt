"started zoloft 25mg but was told to brake  in half for three days then go to the 25mg for two weeks then to 50mg , the first week was hell!!! Was throwing up none stop, horrible diarrhea made my anxiety so much worse, I weighed 85 pounds and went down to 73, was in and out of the er because I needed fluids, after week too I could tell my depression was better but my anxiety was still bad got to the point I couldn&#039;t leave my bed, my son missed basketball games had to have my mom go to the store for me, after week 3 on the 50mg doctor  prescribed me  xanax (one a day if needed) it helped a lot with my anxiety but my side effects keep getting worse so the doctor got me off the zoloft, a lot better now off the zoloft and haven&#039;t had anxiety in a week,"
