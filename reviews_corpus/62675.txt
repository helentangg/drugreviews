"I have been on citalopram for a week now, the side effects flared up around 2-3 days and then subsided after about the 4th day to a manageable level. I constantly feel tired like I pulled an all nighter, but mentally clear and alert. Slight nausea and dizziness/feeling like fainting faded after about the 3rd/4th day. Still waiting for the anxiety to disappear but I&#039;m told it will take at least 2 weeks."
