"My first migraine came at 16 years of age.  Extreme headache pain, optical halos that would move over my eyes for 45 minutes, vomiting, serious aversion to light and smell.  At age 32 the migraine events became a daily experience.  My doctor prescribed 25 mg of Amitriptyline at bedtime.  The headaches disappeared and very rarely does one break through.  However, when it does breakthrough all I get is the optical side of the headache which lasts 45 mins.

I have tried to wean myself off the medication but after a week the headaches start again.  Today I have been on the medication for 29 years and I am very happy that this low dosage of this drug allows me the ability to have a great life, free of that horrible pain and suffering"
