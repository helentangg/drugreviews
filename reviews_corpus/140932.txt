"I was prescribed Lexapro 1 and 1/2 months ago for Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Depression.  The first day I took it, I was a bit nauseous but that never happened again.  After a week my depression improved quite a bit, but my anxiety remained.  It took, I&#039;d say, about 5 weeks for the anxiety to improve.  It&#039;s not completely gone, but I am finding that I am 1. in a much better mood than I have been in a long time and 2. My worry/anxiety has definitely decreased.  It hasn&#039;t changed ME, it has changed the way I look at things.  I have had no other side effects, and the medication is definitely working."
