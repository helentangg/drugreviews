"Took about 3 weeks for this medicine to kick in before I noticed anything. When it did, the pain was intense for a couple of days but I stuck with it hoping things got better. They did! I was able to stand longer, walk longer, sit longer, and lay on my side all without intense pain. The pain was still there, but it made dealing with the pain more tolerable. I&#039;ve been on this medicine for about 10 months now but dealing with this terrible pain for nearly 3 years. I&#039;ve tried just about every medicine available and this medicine with Elavil and Oxycontin/Oxycodone  works like magic. I now use Cymbalta with Elavil and Morphine and have had no issues. "
