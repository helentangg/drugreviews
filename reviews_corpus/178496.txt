"I have been on Cymbalta for a year. Has helped with depression and overall my moods have been better. It doesn&#039;t take much to make me sad, angry, or to cry though.  I suffer from constipation, dry mouth, decreased libido, very hard to get orgasms, nausea, forgetfulness and a few other minor side effects. Wish they (most antidepressants) weren&#039;t so hard to go off of. I seem to go deeper into depression with any attempts to go off the medicines."
