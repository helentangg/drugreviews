"After trying several SSRI&#039;s and suffering horrible side effects, I was scared to try another. After doing a bit of research, I came across liquid Prozac and asked my Dr. about it. I have been on it for a week at 3mg and already feel better. I am slowly moving up to 5mg, but as of now, 3mg is working out just fine.  My anxiety has lessened and I can focus and concentrate without my mind running wild."
