"Took 75mg approx 2 years.  Began to to have hair loss and decided to stop med.  Titrated dose over 2 week period.  Severe withdrawal symptoms but determined to come off med.  Had extreme headaches, walked on tip toes almost 2 weeks because brain felt like it was bouncing against skull with every step I took.   Got better with time but now 6 months without med and I am having headaches and phantom smells.  Smelling cigarette smoke and we are smoke free family.  The smell wakes me sometimes and yesterday during church service was smelling smoke.   It seems more noticeable when air conditioning is running.  Doctor wanted to have head MRI done but insurance denied.
Anyone else experience this?  Wish I had never swallowed the first capsule."
