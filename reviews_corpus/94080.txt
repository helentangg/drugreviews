"Was on this for about 6 weeks, did absolutely nothing for my depression (possibly even made it worse). 

The nausea was horrific, I had to start taking Ondansetron (a drug that chemotherapy patients take!) just to get through the day/night without throwing up. Tried taking it at different times and nothing worked.

I had high hopes for Vortioxetine due to the research I had done on clinical trials etc. so I&#039;m sure it does wonders for some people however did nothing for me unfortunately.

Also important to note; it is quite pricey, and for those in Australia; it&#039;s not on the PBS so make sure you buy it at chemist warehouse (it&#039;s at its cheapest here for about $70AUD per box)"
