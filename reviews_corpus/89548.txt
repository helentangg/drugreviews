"I used Celexa for postpartum depression and it was like a miracle!  I had a sick baby and just thought I was a &#039;bad mom&#039; and couldn&#039;t handle the stress.  My marriage took a big hit and my husband refused to have a 2nd child with me due to the depression/anxiety.  I spoke to my doctor when my son was 7-8 months old and went on 10 mg of Celexa.  It was like turning on a light in a dark room!  I sure wish I would have figured out what was wrong with me sooner!  I tried to go off after about a year, but the moodiness and irritability came back, so I went back on for another 6 months or so before successfully stopping.  Few side effects for me.  I would recommend!"
