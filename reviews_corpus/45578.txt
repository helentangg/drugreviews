"I have been on Prozac for about 12 years. I&#039;m a small person (about 5 ft tall, 115 pounds). I take 10 mg every other day. My Doctors say this dosage is a placebo, but I highly disagree. I use to suffer from mild, sometimes not so mild depression. Never have had it while I have been on Prozac. It just cuts off strong emotions. No rage, no crying, and sometimes no feelings! This is the only problem, I am basically numb on emotions. I only cry when things really hit me hard. It has to be hard! I must say, I love alcohol on Prozac, it only takes one drink to lighten me up. This drug has been a life saver!"
