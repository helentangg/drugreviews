"Took this med for a month at 20mg and I was one of those who began to notice positive effects overnight. It improved my mood exponentially and since I&#039;ve never had a sex drive (from depression) I actually gained one while on Paxil. Sex was much more pleasurable. Unfortunately I thought I could find a med that was even BETTER, so was put on Cymbalta and Abilify, but have had miniscule improvements. Tomorrow I&#039;m going to start back up on the Paxil."
