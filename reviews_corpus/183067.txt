"I suffer with arthritis in hands, knees, elbows, and hips.  In 2013 I underwent a total left hip replacement and worked hard in rehab to become active again.  However, as time progresses, my joints continue to &#039;talk&#039; to me loudly.  In the mornings, I look like a crone hobbling around until from moving they begin to become fluid.  Ridiculous!  My doctor put me on Cymbalta back in December of 2014.  Wow.  What a difference.  I did have some struggles on learning when to take it without suffering with nausea, dizziness, etc.  For me, morning time seems to be the ticket.  Mid day or evening caused stomach and head issues. I am on a  lower dose compared to what I have read, but I give this a A+.  Within 15 minutes of taking my dose, I am fine."
