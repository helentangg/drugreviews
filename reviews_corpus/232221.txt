"I had been taking Sertraline for anxiety. Started on paroxetine for the hot flashes as the recommendation of my doctor. Hot flashes reduced significantly, but an occasional hot flash wasn&#039;t as bad. BUT, then I started having what I would call side effects: itching on my scalp, my underarms, eye brows and other warmer, damper areas. I went from fanning myself to scratching. Not attractive. I tried weaning myself from paroxetine and the itching subsided,  but now the hot flashes are returning.My libido went from poor to nothing on this medication.  I didn&#039;t think much about the brain fog and zaps until I read this blog. Since being off of it completely, my emotions are out of control (crying, anxiety..) Don&#039;t think this is for me."
