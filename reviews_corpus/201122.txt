"Half the reviews on here are a load of garbage. They range from &quot;the side effects are too awful&quot; to &quot;It gives me more anxiety&quot;. Do yourself a favor and do not read to any review from anyone who has taken this drug for less than 8 weeks. If you are serious about reducing your anxiety, then grow some balls and give zoloft time to work. 

Yes, you&#039;re going to have a number of side effects in the beginning, ranging from drowsiness, nausea, sexual disfunction, loss of appetite, and even increased anxiety. Guess what, nearly all of these are going to disappear after the first two weeks. In fact, all of the side effects disappeared for me, and it wasn&#039;t until around week 8 that I felt the glorious power of this drug.
