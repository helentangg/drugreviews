"Initially, I was put on Lexapro and Klonopin (.5 mg 4 times a day) for panic disorder. After a few months, I was able to take the Klonopin as needed, usually once a day, and experienced very few symptoms of panic. After a year, I was feeling a lot better and decided to come off of it. The Lexapro really did help so much with my panic attacks, but I still had generalized anxiety. After a lot of therapy and lifestyle changes, my GAD was very well-managed and I was able to come off of Lexapro. 2 months down the road, I had a huge relapse due to a medical crisis and my doctor put me back on Lexapro. It pooped out and I was experiencing severe anxiety. I was on this medication 3 times for a total of 5 years."
