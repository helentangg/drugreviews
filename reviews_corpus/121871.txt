"Been on this medicine for Fybromyalgia for 4 days and it has made a lot of difference already.  I am on the very low dose at the moment 37.5mg and am titrating up to 75mg after the first week. I feel sick in the morning before I eat (which I don&#039;t usually do until lunch time) but after a coffee this feeling subsides enough to manage.  I have tried about 6 other medicines over the past 12 months and the side effects of them all were intolerable.  However if I can take this medicine with the effect it has already had then I will be happy."
