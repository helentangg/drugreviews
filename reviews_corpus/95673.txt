"Looking back I realized I&#039;d been suffering depression plus social anxiety for the best part of 3 years. This spiralled especially over the last year in severe anxiety, being unable to speak to people, crying obsessively and having no motivation or energy to even get dressed. It became choreful and frightening to live a normal day out, even talk to my family and for most part I would use alcohol and sleep to escape. I had no concentration, was emotionless and numb. I was very skeptic however accepted 50mg as a starting dose, 2 weeks later going up to 100mg. It was gradual, although I&#039;m now in a position to say when I can finally feel relieved and extremely hopeful about the future! I enjoy going to work and can laugh again! Miracle medicine."
