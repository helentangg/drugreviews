"I suffered from moderate depression. This medication balances me out pretty well overall. I don&#039;t have the horrible anxiety filled days that I previously had before taking this. I have been taking it for about a year now. The only side effects I had weren&#039;t too serious. I&#039;d occasionally get an upset stomach but I figured out that&#039;s avoidable if I take it with food. Also I had (and still have) crazy vivid dreams nearly every night but that&#039;s harmless."
