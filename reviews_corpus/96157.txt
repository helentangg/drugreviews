"I had always been a very shy, quiet, depressed person and also struggled with fatigue.  After taking this medicine for 2 weeks at 100mg I had what I would call a severe emotional release and then a &quot;coming out of my shell&quot;. It was very exhilarating. I began to approach women which had always been a problem for me, then started to have a lot of girlfriends, very happy for a while, felt like I got my life back. But then I started to do some strange things, began to act very aggressive physically and sexually, took A LOT of dangerous, crazy risks, went out to parties every night and had urge to drink myself out of my mind. Very strong urge to drink, and then sleep for majority of the day."
