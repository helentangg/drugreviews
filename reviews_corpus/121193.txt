"I have been takeing this for a few years. My life has improved so much. I have some side effects and it is easy to deal with. I understand that no drug is perfect and all people are different. However for me this drug has changed my life for me and my family. Im able to deal with the side effects as long as im able to keep my family. Lots of negative info about the drug is online. I get it. Every one has a story. I would recommend this to help others as long as they address thier issues with a positive attitude."
