"Had been on Prozac - that pooped out.  Then Effexor, its was okay.  This okay, but I get the dizzies every evening as the product wears out.  Doctor tried Wellbutrin - not a good fit as I got just plain mean.  I wish I could find a good medicine that sticks with me, doesn&#039;t have me put on weight, and drag me down.  Mood is okay, but just okay.  Not interested in much as I used to be."
