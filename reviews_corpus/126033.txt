"I have been taking Viibryd 40mg for 6 weeks. From about the third day I felt an improvement in my mood and energy. But starting around week four my mood started to change for the worst. I was grumpy and had zero patience for anything. My husband, my two year old, my dog, the list went on. Now at week six I&#039;m ready to jump out a window. I have a Drs. appointment this upcoming week. I need to take myself off of this. I had high hopes for this back to square one."
