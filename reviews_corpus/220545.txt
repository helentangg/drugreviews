"I have tried Cymbalta, tramadol, gabapentin, Lyrica, and other but this medicine took all my pain away. This pill only took my pain away for 8 months then it wasn&#039;t as effective. Also made me gain a lot of weight. I still take it because it removes my pain after taking it last a few hours. Also the medication helps me sleep. It will knock you out."
