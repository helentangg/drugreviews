"Been on Paxil for about 1 month starting my second it&#039;s been helping me a lot with my panic disorders &amp; social experiences. My mg for Paxil is low 10mg. However, whoever is starting this medication don&#039;t get discourage it will take time for Paxil to kick in but it will be worth it at the end just set a daily reminder everyday to take it."
