"My doctor prescribed Citalopram to deal with my anxiety, after nearly 2 weeks of taking them I&#039;m feeling a lot less stressed and calmer with every day life and children (girls 15 &amp; 9). The only down side I&#039;ve experienced is that I am quite lethargic/sleepy but that maybe down to me being off work and having that chilling out time on my own at home. Citalopram has definitely put me back on track in my own frame of mind."
