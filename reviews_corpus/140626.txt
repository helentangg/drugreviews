"I was on Effexor XR for over 9 years and it finally pooped out on me.  My Anxiety and Panic Attacks came back with a vengeance!  I was barely functioning, always afraid that I was going to drop dead.  My psychiatrist recommended a tricyclic antidepressant but I am afraid of those medications.  He then recommended Lexapro.  So I&#039;ve been on Lexapro generic 10 Mgs for 2 and half weeks now.  I have mixed feelings about it right now.  The first week I felt no difference in my anxiety. The second week, I felt great! Hardly felt anxious and hardly reached for the Ativan.  I was sure this was the med for me.  Now I feel out of and a bit anxious again"
