"I have started my journey on this medicine when I was 17, I am now 27 so it&rsquo;s been officially 10 years. I started on it at a 10mg dosage and have made my way up to 20mg over the years however this medicine has really worked for me. I have had severe anxiety which began after I was a victim of abuse and soon after I started having horrible issues with my stomach which was generalized as IBS. Things got so bad that I ended up needing to take a break from college, would have to call out from work because I would get severely anxious and sick with my stomach. Since starting this medication it didn&rsquo;t fix the IBS but it did help with the anxiety which makes the stomach problems much worse. It&rsquo;s not a miracle drug but it has worked for me!"
