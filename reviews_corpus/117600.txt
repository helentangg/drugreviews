"I was getting extreme migranes everyday all day with no relief for over three months going to back and forth to the ER, even had an scans because I thought I had a tumor or cancer finally went to see a neurologist he gave me nortiotyline for 3 months and tordal for pain, within days I was feeling better and and by two weeks they were completley gone.. This is the best medicine."
