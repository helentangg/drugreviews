"The first couple of sites I went to ten days ago when my Dr gave me 3 wk sample of Pristiq, I read all negative things and was apprehensive to take it.  Now, on day 10, I find this site, and I am really happy to read where so many of you have good things to say about Pristiq.   So far, I&#039;m experiencing good things.  I&#039;m more focused at work, I don&#039;t have the hunger pangs I had to eat all the time, and have lost six lbs in 10 days.  I also have a little more energy.  I&#039;m looking forward to when it really kicks in.  But so far I do feel better and I am thankful for that. "
