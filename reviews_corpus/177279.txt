"I have fibromyalgia, and have had this condition for many years. I tried Cymbalta for about two weeks, and never felt like I was in my right mind at all during the time I took it. I would much rather deal with my pain, and feel somewhat alive and painful, rather than a zombie. I do not recommend this drug: it&#039;s hard on the liver, your urine will smell very bad, you&#039;re going to be extremely sleepy, and a feeling of being not quite right. If that&#039;s what it takes to take pain away, I&#039;d much rather work on massage, de-stressing techniques, walks, and praying than to feel like half a human being. That&#039;s been my experience, I glad I had the experience, as it taught me there&#039;s no easy route to pain relief. My hope is the new sodium-blockers!"
