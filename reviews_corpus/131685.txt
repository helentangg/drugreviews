"I was prescribed effexor for anxiety which interfered with sleeping - worry about getting to sleep meant that I wouldn&#039;t sleep which made me feel exhausted, depressed and useless. I&#039;ve also tried Zoloft and Luvox which didn&#039;t do anything. CBT and mindfulness were also pretty useless - just made me slightly more obsessive about my weird problems with getting to sleep. 

Effexor has been amazing. Apart from some insomnia and lightheadedness during the first week I don&#039;t have any side effects. I don&#039;t have the same obsessive and weird anxious thoughts over getting to sleep or other minor things which preoccupied me and made me feel dreadful. I sleep well and my head feels so clear."
