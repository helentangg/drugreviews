"At 47 and pre-menopausal. In addition to having a lung cancer scare (being monitored and if anything were to come out of it, it&#039;s early days). In addition to it a suspicious mammogram and an upcoming colonoscopy (my second) monitoring due to my father passing on from this disease as it was not diagnosed early enough. I was crying for no reason and had no interest in anything.  On Pristiq 2 days now and I feel &quot;different&quot;.  My mood is lighter and I&#039;m not going off on angry tangents for no good reason.  I&#039;m glad it&#039;s not supposed to put on weight - I&#039;m 140 lbs at 5 feet 7 and as I just quit smoking, I will be putting on a few pounds from that.  So far, it&#039;s pretty good."
