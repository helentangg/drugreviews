"This worked really well for depression, in combination with wellbutrin and lamictal. I see a lot of people complaining about sleep troubles, sleep paralysis, vivid dreams, etc. had all those side effects, started taking it both morning and night, and all the side effects went away. Try that, and give it a chance to work."
