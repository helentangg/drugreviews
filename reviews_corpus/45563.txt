"I started on fluoxetine ~4 yrs ago in high school.  My panic attacks came sparingly and I fought it out for around 6 months. I noticed a difference 2 weeks into starting fluoxetine. I used to get a panic attack and almost always throw up.  This is not the case anymore. I&#039;m on 20mg and I do great. I&#039;ll get heightened anxiety maybe once every couple of months.  The best I can describe panic attacks now is a &quot;buzzing&quot; feeling in your brain.  Most of the time I can just breathe and it will go away.

I have noticed no side effects."
