"I&#039;ve had &quot;a&quot; really bad headache for over 6 weeks now. On my right side.   I say &quot;a&quot; because it is almost constant, day and night every day.  Seldom have I had headaches my entire life.  I&#039;m now 60.  After 4 visits to a doctor, (the first one prescribed antibiotics saying I had a sinus infection-no help what so ever, the second guy Midrin, same thing). I was prescribed nortriptyline at 25mg once a day by my last visit with a new doctor.  It has been 3 days, so not much change, yet.  I can put up with any/all the side effects mentioned, if I get relief.  I will repost in a week or 2, when hopefully it has kicked in.  Scheduled for a CAT scan in 2 days.....we&#039;ll see.  Reading these posts has given me some hope."
