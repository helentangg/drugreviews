"I&#039;ve been taking it for 3 days, and I will begin CBT next week (therapy). I take 50mg for 14 days then 14 days off. 
I already find myself more in control of my feelings. I feel I want to get cross/angry but I am able to stop this feeling. It&#039;s sooo weird!! 
If I think about things that I know will make me sad, my mind snaps me back to reality, the here and now. 
Side effects so far include a bit tired, a little nauseous, my feet are not as tickily!, and I didn&#039;t get as much pleasure out of Aquafit today as I normally do. 
I was really nervous when starting this drug, but so far it&#039;s good."
