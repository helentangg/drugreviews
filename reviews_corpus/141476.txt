"Thought I would share my experience about Lexapro here. After transitioning from year 12 into university I started to feel down. I felt anxious throughout year 12 but nothing like how I was feeling in March. I was at my lowest and I wasn&#039;t enjoying any of my normal activities I was literally getting up to live a hopeless day. I knew that this feeling wasn&#039;t right so I got help. Doc prescribed me 20 mg of Lexapro in combination with counseling. Worked for three months now I&#039;m feeling the side effects. I feel there is a cloud over my brain. I can&#039;t feel the emotions good and bad. I can&#039;t cry, when I feel I need to. It&#039;s stunted my emotional empathy. I also feel extremely tired on it."
