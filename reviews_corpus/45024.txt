"I should have been on this sooner.  I&#039;m a 26 year old recent law school graduate enduring the bar exam- unfortunately twice.  My first round of studying I was crying daily, couldn&#039;t sleep, was irritable, extremely depressed, anxious- I am normally these things, but it was heightened by the bar exam.  My first time taking the exam, I didn&#039;t come close to finishing the exam on the second day.  I was crying and couldn&#039;t control my panic attacks.  Second round of studying for the test, I decided to see a psychiatrist who gave me Prozac.  I love it.  I feel like a normal person.  A better version of who I was.  I feel even, I don&#039;t have panic attacks, don&#039;t cry, I feel great."
