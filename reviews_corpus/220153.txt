"Am taking Co codomol 30/500 and Ibrufren 400mg x2 for 10 years as doctor could not find the reason for my pain. Had many scans and therapies but nothing so they just told me to take the tablets. When we moved house I changed doctors and went to him for a repeat prescription. He asked why I had been taking them so long and what doses I was taking. I was taking 8 x co comodal and 4 x ibrufen a day. He diagnosed me with fibromyalgia and suggested I try Amitriptyline. He suggested 10mg at first raising to 20mg if I had not side effects. He said to carry on with the pain relief when I felt I needed it. I took some time off work and went ahead. It was amazing. I slept through for the first time in 10 years. So happy and reduced pain meds by half."
