"IF YOURE READING REVIEWS RIGHT NOW, DEBATING TRYING THIS, DO IT RIGHT NOW. I was so anxious to try this, I thought I was gonna be a zombie. Its only my first day taking it and I just want to let you know the side effects are very doable. Slight nausea, slight headaches, a little confusion, a little more alert. Honestly, if I wasn&#039;t paying attention to them I wouldn&#039;t even probably notice I&#039;m having side effects....(I&#039;m  sensitive to medications by the way) I say give this a shot, I know new medications can be scary but you never know, it can be your miracle drug."
