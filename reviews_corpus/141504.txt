"I was prescribed Lexapro about a year and a half ago after suffering from severe depression and anxiety (female, 23). Started on 10mg and have just upped the dosage to 20mg. I get a yawn and get a bit of nausea, also makes me a bit frigidity/hard to focus. Even so, it&#039;s done wonders on my moods and how my brain seems to function. It helps me sleep, I don&#039;t have crazy vivid dreams any more. If I miss a dose or two you can really tell the difference. It definitely mellows me out and I feel like I can manage basic day to day things since starting it. I have had some trouble with orgasming, however not always. Can&#039;t drink any alcohol on it because it goes straight my head and makes me go silly. Lexapro has changed my life."
