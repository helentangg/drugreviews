"I have been on Pristiq for 10 days now.  The first two and a half days I felt sick, dizzy and fuzzy.  I have had no side effects since.  Lost 2.5 lbs the first week, which is a plus. Was on Lexapro a few years ago and gained a lot of weight.  I also suffer from panic attacks and am taking Xanax when needed.  Going through divorce, 23 year marriage."
