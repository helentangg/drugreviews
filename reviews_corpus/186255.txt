"20 yo female. I had my first dose at 50mg this morning. After battling depression and anxiety for about 3 years, I made the choice to start meds when it became too much to bear. What I can tell you about my day is that it&#039;s been an experience! Feeling foggy, dizzy, slightly nauseous. The strangest side effects were the extreme hour long high, fidgeting, and a huge compulsion to clench my jaw/grind my teeth. Regardless of the side effects (remembering it is only day one) I have felt not only happiness, but joy, comfort, and decreased anxiety. Before today I can&#039;t remember the last time I had a good laugh. "
