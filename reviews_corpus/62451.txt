"I&#039;ve been on Celexa 20mg for 15 years now and I love it.  I started with Paxil and then try Zoloft and Wellbutrin.  The last three medication made me feel like a zombie.  But Celexa is different.  Celexa made me feel like myself again, no side effect.  I had a big depression (due to baby blues and multiple surgeries and lots of pain for long periods of time).  Celexa SAVED MY LIFE.  I&#039;ve been on 20mg for all this time and didn&#039;t have to increase the dosage.  If I try to stop, I become suicidal again (with no reasons at all) so I will keep taking this wonderful life saving medicine forever.  Thank you for saving me. You cannot &quot;control&quot; depression with your &quot;will&quot;.  Depression is a sickness, like diabetes or heart problems, and Celexa is the best."
