"Have been using the 6MG patch for 4 weeks now with absolutely no results. No side effects. No skin irritation. Nothing. Doctor says I should be patient and wait till the 6 week point where it might finally kick in. If it doesn&#039;t we will go to the higher dosage. Probably just double it to the 12MG patch. Not looking forward to the dietary restrictions but it&#039;s a trade off I&#039;m willing to take for relief from 30+ years of despair."
