"I just started Pristiq Exrelease 50mg about 6 days ago. I am just learning more about this drug.  All these comments are very helpful, I have much, much hope.  I have anxiety issues, panic disorder, and some depression. I have also noticed decreased hunger.  Please continue writing in it can make a big difference to people like me.  Thank you!"
