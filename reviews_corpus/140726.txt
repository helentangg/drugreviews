"I started taking Cipralex about 7 months after my brother died. I was having terrible thoughts about something happening to my son and I felt so overwhelmed with anxiety. I was very irritable and felt that I was never going to be happy again.
I started at 5mg and it was amazing how quickly I felt better. Doc said to go to 10mg which continued to help. After almost a year, I got pregnant with my second child and went off Cipralex for the baby&#039;s health. The side effects were terrible and even though I tapered off slowly I had awful brain zaps and the headaches were unbelievable. I was so sad and my anxiety was worsening. Got through it for my baby and had a healthy girl. Back on and doing well after PPD"
