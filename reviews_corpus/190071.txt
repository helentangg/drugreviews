"I took this drug for over 20 years.  It worked extremely well for me.  Dry mouth was my only side effect.  I was told by my pharmacy they could no longer get it.  I took the generic for a while but it never worked as well.  I was surprised to read others have taken it recently.  How sad something that worked so well for many is hard to get.  I would switch back in a heartbeat."
