"I have taken Cymbalta for about a year and a half for fibromyalgia pain. It is great
as a pain reducer and an anti-depressant, however, the side effects outweighed 
any benefit I got from it. I had trouble with restlessness, being tired constantly,
dizziness, dry mouth, numbness and tingling in my feet, and horrible sweating. I am
being weaned off of it now. Went from 60 mg to 30mg and now to 15 mg. I will be
off completely in about a week. The fibro pain is coming back, but I would rather deal with it than the side effects."
