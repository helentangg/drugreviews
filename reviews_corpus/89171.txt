"My mother is 100 1/2 years old and has been living in a nursing home for the past 10 years.  Last year she developed severe anxiety (not really depression), fearful of almost everything around her.  Totally irrational.  At the request of the family, the nursing home put her on 20 mg Celexa and her mood turned around almost immediately with no side effects.  She was cheerful again and was willing to take life as it came her way.  To see if she could function on a lower dose, about a month ago they dropped her dose to 10 mg and the anxiety returned.  Today her dose was brought back up to 20 mg, and we are anticipating a return to her non-anxious self."
