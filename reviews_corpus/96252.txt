"I&#039;ve been on Zoloft for 3 months. 1st 4 days were awful. Worked perfectly in 14 days at 50mg. After 1 month stopped working, raised to 100mg then it worked again after only two days. I&#039;ve been on 100mg since, and I feel good. I&#039;ve had only three very short panic attacks (seconds) but sometimes I feel down and bored. I don&#039;t know if that&#039;s because of the Zoloft or my condition or just due to normal daily life stuff. Overall, I feel good and back to normal. I am writing this because I was here once 3 months ago and it felt really good to read the reviews. It&#039;s totally normal like any health condition."
