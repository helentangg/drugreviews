"I am 16 years old and have had migraines off and on since I can remember. They get to the point where I can&#039;t function, can&#039;t eat, sleep, think of anything and they last for days some times even weeks. I have been on amitriptyline for just over a month and it has helped so much! I can already notice that I&#039;m in much less pain, and not getting migraine&#039;s half as much. This is an amazing thing and is very very helpful."
