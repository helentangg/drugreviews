"Having a history of family heath problems it was my time to develop one of my own, i was diagnosed with moderately severe depression and was placed on a moderate dose of Prozac. Weeks in i became extremely lethargic , my mood hadn&#039;t stabilized one bit, i presumed i would need a higher dose and that followed.
Eventually the dosage had quadrupled and showing no improvement, i beg to view the world in a haze, nothing seemed real and i didn&#039;t recognize myself . I was incredibly suicidal.
If you are not feeling this drug is effective do not continue using it, otherwise suicide is a very genuine threat.

I have found Sertraline effective as opposed to this freakish medicine."
