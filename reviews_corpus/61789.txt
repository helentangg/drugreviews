"I took one 10mg tablet at 7:30pm, I slept from 9pm-1am and then woke up with extreme nausea, diarrhea, high anxiety, dry mouth and what I think were night sweats and insomnia. I plan to call my Doctor in the morning to see if there is an alternative. I can&#039;t imagine feeling that horrible for weeks on end."
