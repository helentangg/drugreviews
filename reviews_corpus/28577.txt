"I have only been on Lexapro 10mg for 5 days, but already my anxiety is better. I am a 16 year old, 5&#039;8 female, 280lbs. The side effects were pretty bad the first 3 days or so, nervousness, increased sweating, nausea, headaches, etc., but I&#039;m definitely starting to feel better. One positive side effect is that my appetite has decreased dramatically. Sometimes I have to make myself eat, and I can&#039;t eat as much as before. Of all the side effects, I hope this one stays!"
