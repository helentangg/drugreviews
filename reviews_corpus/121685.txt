"First off, everyone will react differently to each med and bottom line is that you have to try it for yourself. I&#039;ve read horror stories about Effexor but quite frankly, it&#039;s worked great for me, and luckily it was the first one prescribed. I had to build up to the 37.5mg  dose over 1.5 wks otherwise it made me nauseous. After a few weeks I felt fine, other than occ. hot flashes &amp; had to take at exact same time every day. Was on it for about a year, then weaned off slowly and had no issues at all. Was fine for 4 years until I lost my job, then had to go back on for anxiety/panic attacks, this time at 75mg. Only real problem for me was weight gain. Trying Cipralex now but I don&#039;t like it; will likely switch back and just deal with the weight"
