"I had tried every medication in the books, but with no success and really bad side effects. I now take 20MG escitalopram first thing in the morning.  But around 5pm my anxiety kicks in and I feel panic attacks coming, but that is when I have it timed out to take 1MG clonazapam.  Then around 9pm when I am ready for bed, I take 150MG Seroquel.  This is absolutely the PERFECT combination to balance out my day.  I have had severe depression for about 12 years with nightmares and panic attacks. I felt like life was hopeless. I was unable to make any friends because I was overwhelmed with anxiety and couldn&#039;t establish relationships.  This combination has finally given me hope.  I am able to be social now. I am able to feel good.  Thank you!!!"
