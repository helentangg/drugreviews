"I&#039;ve been taking it for less than a month and I already want to stop. I would rather be in pain than be how I am with this medicine. It makes me foggy and extremely tired, and depression symptoms I haven&#039;t had in months are coming back. I can barely do anything because all I feel like doing is sleeping. My fibro pain isn&#039;t horrible anymore, but this is worse. I&#039;m going to stop now while I&#039;m still on 20mg before weaning off becomes harder."
