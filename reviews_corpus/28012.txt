"Lexapro has literally saved my life! Before starting the medication, I was terribly depressed &amp; suicidal.  I finally got the courage, with the help of my husband to talk to my physician.  I initially began on the 10mg dosage. The first week was rough with bad headaches, nausea and extreme fatigue. By the second week, the only side affect I had was a little spaciness that I feel was from the fatigue that had continued.  However; at week 2, I felt so much better. Now after 2.5 months and moving to a 20mg dose, I have my life back! I haven&#039;t felt this much peace in years. I can sleep. I can laugh. I can smile.....and I can&#039;t imagine taking my own life.  Best of all: I can love others because I&#039;m happy and at peace with myself. Worth it all!!!!"
