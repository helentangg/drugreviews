"I&rsquo;ve suffered from longstanding low-level depression ever since I can remember, and have often pondered with the idea of trying an antidepressant even though I stay away from medication as much as I can. 
Everything has worsened over the last year since my youngest, fittest sister died prematurely of breast cancer with extensive liver metastasis (or whichever came first)&hellip;I was with her for the 7 weeks after diagnosis and watched her take her last 2 breaths; this pain has become more intense lately and I would find myself crying like a baby over my little sister&hellip;
My demented elderly father got a prescription for Zoloft (he must also be depressed because of my sister&rsquo;s death), but since no one at his home was giving it to him I decided to give it a try!
I&rsquo;ve been taking 25mg (elixir) for 2 weeks and have seen a huge difference in my crying spells; I still think about my little sister, but don&rsquo;t feel that overwhelming sadness as much&hellip;
The first week I took the Zoloft at bedtime, but started to notice difficulty falling asleep, so now I take it in the morning&hellip;I felt no other side effects!
I&rsquo;m far from being a peppy, energetic person, but at least some of my suffering has been alleviated, and that&rsquo;s what living is about; who needs to be in constant emotional pain!?
Good luck to all!"
