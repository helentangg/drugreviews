"Sertraline is the best thing to help anxiety I&rsquo;ve suffered for 10 years without knowing I had anxiety I would buy all different kind of over the counter medication and Herman remedy&rsquo;s and nothing worked thought I had IBS I didn&rsquo;t, then I  thought I had a brain tumour with all headaches and I didn&rsquo;t. My anxiety and stress made me worry more about my health until I went doctors they prescribed sertraline. I&rsquo;ve only been taking them a month and while the first 2 weeks was horrible while they got into my system I feel the best I&rsquo;ve ever felt.  I have more energy, less headaches, minimal worry about every day things. Sertraline is fantastic. I&rsquo;m on 100mg and feel great. If anyone who has anxiety I strongly recommend that that try this medication"
