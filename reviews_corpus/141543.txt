"LEXAPRO changed my life. I am so against medication and was scared to try anything but after 6 months of pure hell and not able to function I surrendered to Lexapro and am SO happy I did. The side effects were bad but by the help of my Dr. and this page I didn&#039;t give up. It took the 6 weeks to start feeling like a human again. The two things I would say to anyone starting is 1. Give it time, 2 months plus and 2. Pills are not miracles, you have to work on yourself and with a professional in addition but it&#039;s worth it.
Stay Strong."
