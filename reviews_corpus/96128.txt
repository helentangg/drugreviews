"I have been taking Wellbutrin for a while for my depression but it stopped working. My doctor prescribed Zoloft. It definitely worked well but the side effects are undesirable, I clench my teeth a lot my heart beats fast, I have nausea and I have delayed or no ejaculation. It&#039;s driving me nuts."
