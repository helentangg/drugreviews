"I have used Prozac (gained a lot of weight)  Now I am on a combination of Wellbutrin and Cymbalta.  What a difference.  No foggy brain.  My emotions are back.  Don&#039;t feel like a zombie any more.  Feel a little dizzy at times, but the benefits outweigh the side effects.  I lost 10 kg !!!  Look and feel great.  Will stay on this combination.  Great for depression."
