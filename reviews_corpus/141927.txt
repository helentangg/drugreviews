"About 1.5 years ago, I had a very serious, nearly fatal skiing accident. The six months following my experience, I found myself petrified to drive, extremely nervous and plagued by nightmares. My anxiety eventually lead to depression - I lost all confidence, became extremely self critical and was highly dissatisfied with my life. Exercise and &quot;positive thought&quot; helped, but did not restore me to my previous self. I began taking 5mg of Lexapro about 11 months ago; I still get nervous, excited, happy, angry, sad - but now the feelings of sadness and anxiety do not overwhelm me. I feel like myself again!
I have noticed a few side effects - dry mouth, some indigestion, periodic trouble sleeping (1x/month) and some trouble with orgasm.Not to bad!"
