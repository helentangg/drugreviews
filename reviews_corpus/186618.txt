"I am glad to see most people here on this forum had positive experiences with Pristiq. I have been on Pristiq for 7 long days. While I know it takes weeks for antidepressant medications to take effect I could not tough it out. My pupils were so dilated, headaches, severe diarrhea, chills, stomach pain. It&#039;s amazing how medications affect people different."
