"On Pristiq for my Generalized anxiety disorder I felt really positive, stopped wanting to harm myself, felt confident, was able to get to sleep, wanted to have sex, be outgoing, and not have the cyclical bursts of anxiety and rage. I didn&#039;t have panic attacks for a while on this medication until I had some situational issues that brought back my depression. As for the side effects, it actually forced me to stop taking the drug. Every night I was sweating PROFUSELY to the point I was waking up shivering and soaked in sweat; you would see an outline of my body from sweat on the sheets when I woke up. I also had EXTREMELY distressing violent nightmares. This occurred in conjunction when my depression came back, so it could be a possible reason for the sweating and night terrors."
