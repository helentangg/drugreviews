"The drug removed some of the empty &#039;raw&#039; feeling lonely feeling about life, as well as intrusive wincing thoughts.  I find it pretty sedating, can sleep through the weekend if not carefull.  Creates a kind of careless numb feeling toward everything, but that can be better than the alternative.  For the first few weeks I remember it can increase anxiety a little, have heard many people quit cause of this, and sleeplessness at start.  I wonder how bad they really were to start, I kept going because I couldnt go back, reminding myself how it was before starting.  Five years seem to drift by, yes it makes life easier, but probabally removes some of the motivation to change, complacency sets in."
