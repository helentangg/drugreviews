"Overall I love this pill, I have been on 75mg of Effexor for 8 years after being severely depressed and suicidal. I haven&#039;t had the same type of mood the whole time. The only downfall to this medication is the side effects, I have found that I have no libido and often very tired. Also if I miss one day I have very bad side effects like a really bad hangover. I am a little afraid of getting off the pill but I would like to try. Overall if you need help with your depression this pill is amazing."
