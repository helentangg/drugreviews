"Completely changed my life. I was having severe anxiety accompanied with frequent panic attacks and was feeling hopeless about improvement. 

First two weeks on Celexa were terrible, but I can&#039;t necessary attribute all symptoms as side effects because my anxiety was so bad it could have been that.  I was waking up with night terrors, had extreme fatigue, dizziness, and dissociation. But then at some point I forgot about my anxiety and was living a normal life again. 

I started at 10 mg and went to 20 mg before coming back down to 10 mg due to improvement.  After about 6 months I weaned off the drug completely and have only mild anxiety relapses currently."
