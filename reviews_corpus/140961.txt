"I am only 18 years old and I have been on 5 mg lexapro (Escitalopram) for 2 years now, haven&#039;t had any panic attacks or anxiety since I started it. I feel so much better and no more anxiety! If this medication is new to you, in the first few weeks you may have a few side effects until you get use to it but nothing at all to worry about."
