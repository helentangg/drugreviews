"I had a terrible reaction to Cymbalta called Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome.  Stiff muscles, couldn&#039;t stand let alone walk to the phone, couldn&#039;t feel my hands and feet, fever, blood pressure through the roof. After a family member found me on the floor drooling I was taken to the hospital in an ambulance.  I realize this is a rare side effect, but it does happen.  What&#039;s great for one person may not be great for the next."
