"DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICATION WITHOUT READING THIS.  IT CONFLICTS WITH MANY MEDICATIONS...including many common over the counter medicines. 5 years, 60 mg -120 mg day, suicidal and non functional much of that time and it got worse. Diagnosed bipolar 2 also BPD. Thank goodness for the drug interaction checker because I had 4 red lights. No wonder I was sick. I am going off Cymbalta. Remember: YOU ARE IN CHARGE OF YOUR HEALTH CARE,  NOT YOUR DOCTOR."
