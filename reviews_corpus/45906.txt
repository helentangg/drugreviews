"It took me a long time to realize that I had an issue with depression and finally talked to my doctor about it.  I have no excuse for depression, I have a wonderful life, two beautiful boys and a wonderful husband but I would get such an overwhelming sense of sadness that would just envelope me and I couldn&#039;t even smile.  Not every day, not even all day.  I have been on this drug for a month now and WHAT A DIFFERENCE. I don&#039;t get the sadness at all anymore and I&#039;m not as &#039;edgy&#039;.  It hasn&#039;t changed who I am but has allowed me to live my life.  I have been incredibly tired, but that could be due to illness and the other medicines I take for allergies and for Raynaud&#039;s (lose feeling in my hands and feet in the cold)."
