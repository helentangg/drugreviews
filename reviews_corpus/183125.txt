"I just started taking this medication last night and ALREADY feel so much better. I&#039;ve tried Prozac, Celexa, Zoloft, Buspar, Abilify, and countless others to help with my anxiety and none of them worked. This medication is a miracle in my opinion. I can&#039;t believe how quickly it works too. I&#039;m taking this along with Atarax to help anxiety and panic attacks. I like the Atarax too and have not needed to take clonazepam today. Very happy. Only problem was that I couldn&#039;t sleep last night. I was physically exhausted and couldn&#039;t open my eyes or move but my mind was active. Hopefully this will pass. I&#039;ve also had an upset stomach today with diarrhea but it beats anxiety any day!"
