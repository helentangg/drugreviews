"I started this in the hospital at 20 after a few days they upped it to 40. I felt weird the first week or so then somewhat normal
 I didn&#039;t have an appetite for the first couple of weeks
 The major side effect has been insomnia.  I woke up at 2 or 3 in the morning.  I don&#039;t fall alseep because I have to get up at 6 and my spouse will get up at 445 am
I&#039;ve taking my son to school and then coming home and sleeping. I tired tea, melatonin and some liquid sleep aid but morning has worked to help sleep through the night
I dont want to take another medication"
