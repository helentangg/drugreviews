"This is my second time on Zoloft.  The first time it was recommended and prescribed by my physician for Hep C treatment.  I had CRAZY side effects but back then I could not distinguish which medicine was causing this. I could not eat, trembling, sweats, etc.  Two years later and Hep C cleared (ya-hoo) I found myself anxious and severely depressed.  I was prescribed Zoloft 50mg and I have been taking it for two days.  I have lost two pounds cannot eat, sleep and my head feels likes it going to explode with worry and pressure.  I called my doctor but of course he was not in, so I got a professional opinion from a friend who told me to stick it out that the symptoms would subside.  "
