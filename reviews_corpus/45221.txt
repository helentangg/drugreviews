"The best thing that has happened to me in a long time. I&#039;m only on my second month but my PMDD symptoms have already reduced and the anxiety that I had throughout the rest of the month is pretty much gone!I feel like myself again and can&#039;t believe how much brighter everything seems.

Did get flu symptoms at the beginning, dry mouth and awful nightmares but after a couple of weeks they all disappeared, I&#039;m on 20mg."
