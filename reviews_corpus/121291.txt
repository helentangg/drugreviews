"I can&#039;t really say anything about how effective it is because it worsened ALL of my symptoms. Despression, considerably worse. Urge for Amphetemines, Alcohol and Cocaine (as well as valium on one occasion) were severly worsened and I havent touched any of those drugs (except alcohol) in nearly 20 years. Suicidal thought weren&#039;t even present until I took this medication and I was on the lowest dose available. All Symptomes of Restless Limb Syndrome were severly worsened. Derealisation was worsened to the point of depersonalisation. Anxiety was drastic to the point that I wanted Amphetemines against the Down AND Valium/Xanax against the anxiety.
 Urge for strong drugs and RLS symptomes were only tolerable after microdosing cannabis."
