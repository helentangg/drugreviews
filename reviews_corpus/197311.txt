"Paxil was an absolute life changer for me 8 years before &#039;pooping out&#039; last year. Alcohol abuse was almost certainly the cause of it&#039;s ineffectiveness &amp; I have learned my lesson. Many negative reviews on the web describe the severe withdrawal symptoms. I count myself lucky that Paxil worked wonders for me WITHOUT any withdrawal periods. Not everyone experiences this withdrawal so if you&#039;re here reading experiences &amp; worrying about possible future withdrawal don&#039;t assume it will happen to you. I am now on mirtazapine which is ok but I really miss the feel good &#039;boost&#039; &amp; confidence that Paxil gave me. I used to call this my &#039;serotonin high&#039;.  I hope to find another SSRI that worked similar to Paxil for me. Zoloft &amp; citalopram failed."
