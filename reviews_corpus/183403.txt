"I&#039;ve been on Cymbalta for depression and GAD since July.  I don&#039;t think it is working.  I am still depressed and have anxiety attacks several times a week.  Have talked to my Psychiatrist about this and he just says to give it more time.  I am changing Psychiatrists after the first of the year."
