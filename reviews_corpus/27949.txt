"I&#039;ve been taking 10mgs for about 8 months. About a month ago I went through some tough times that sent me to the mental hospital. After I got out I told the psych to cut the Lexapro because it was making me fat and it didn&#039;t keep me from going to the hospital. Within a week of starting it I felt overwhelming sadness that progressed to the point that I couldn&#039;t get out of bed and I would draw the blinds in the day and just sob. My psych is on vacation right now but I couldn&#039;t take the sadness anymore so I restarted my Lexapro and within 2 days I was feeling so much better. I&#039;m grateful for it now."
