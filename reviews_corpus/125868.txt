"I&#039;ve been on Viibryd for a year now. It&#039;s completely changed my life. When I went to the doctor I knew it was time to get help. I still have a bad day now and then but who doesn&#039;t. No more crying, staying in bed for days and hating life. I know medication works differently for everyone but this is what worked for me. No matter what don&#039;t give up get help!"
