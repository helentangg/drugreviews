"I suffered from common migraine most of my adult life and had gone through just about every conceivable medicine there was including Sansert. Nothing seemed to help prevent them but I did have Imitrex to take when I had a migraine. But I took it too often and got rebound headaches. Then, with the 4th neurologist within 25 years, she prescribed 50 mg of amitriptyline to take at night. Immediately I was free of migraines and over 10 years have never had to resort to Imitrex. Amitriptyline changed my life."
