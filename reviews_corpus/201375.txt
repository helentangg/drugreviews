"I was prescribed Zoloft 50mg about a year ago after giving birth to my daughter very prematurely. I did notice that during the most difficult times, I was actually very calm and could make rational decisions. Why did I stop taking it? I have no idea. Recently, I&#039;ve had horrible panic attacks that have landed me in the hospital, made me call out of work, and pretty much incapacitated me. I didn&#039;t want to go back on medication, but prayer, exercise, and talking just wasn&#039;t getting it. I finally went to my doctor and he put me back on Zoloft 50mg. Right now I&#039;m just taking 50mg once a day, but next week I start taking them twice a day. I&#039;m also on 0.5 mg Klonopin. Already, I have began to feel a little better. Hoping it continues."
