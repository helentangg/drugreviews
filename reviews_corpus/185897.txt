"Its been nearly 2 years on various doses of Pristiq, and 100mg each day works best for my mind. Thankfully.
I have some side effects that annoy me a lot, like no appetite, nausea, gut problems &amp; worst of all- killed my libido this whole time. It simply ceased to exist. 
I continue to take my meds. I&#039;m a widow raising a 12 year old for last 7 years after my Husband died suddenly very suddenly of swine flu. So much has been lost from that day. Inevitably it took its toll on me. 
Not a complete person anymore. Its like I feel asexual...
But I am alive and kicking"
