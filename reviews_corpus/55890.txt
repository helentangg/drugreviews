"I took Effexor XR for about 13 years.  It worked fine. I just went off it VERY slowly in February so that we could try and get pregnant.  Pregnancy did not happen an panic attacks came back.  I went back on Effexor and it is like a different medicine!  My vision has gotten so bad that I cannot drive.  I am sick all of the time and I have constant diarrhea.  One of my pupils dilated.  I find it strange that the same medicine won&#039;t work for me as before.  I have been on it now for 5 weeks.  "
