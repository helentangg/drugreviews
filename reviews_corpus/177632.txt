"I have suffered anxiety and depression on/off all my adult life. In 2013 I was prescribed Duloxetine, I suffered 20 days of hell due to the side effects. Suicidal thoughts, mood swings, and limb twitching. Side effects improved once I came off duloxetine but still suffered muscular twitches several months later. "
