"I was prescribed Citalopram (Celexa) about 2 years ago for panic/anxiety attacks. A panic attack is the worst feeling in the world, and I have no idea as to whatever brought it on. If I happen to miss a dosage or two, I tend to get a headache.  Other than that...no major side effects.  It has helped tremendously."
