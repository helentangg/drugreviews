"I was prescribed this after a nervous breakdown while an inpatient at the hospital. I have zero side effects, well perhaps I&#039;m a bit more &quot;flighty&quot;. It does not numb me like other meds have done in the past. I feel like I&#039;m living my life again and enjoying my loved ones. I&#039;m on 20 mg I hope the doctor will increase to 30 because I feel near the finish line but not 100% there yet."
