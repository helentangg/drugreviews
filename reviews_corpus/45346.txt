"Prozac completely changed my personality to worse. I was a worrying, anxious person and after 3 months of prozac I stopped caring about anything, starting having agressive bouts of being irritable, and also killed my libido.
Regret having taken this. Therapy is the answer for me and I am sure for maaaaaaany people who take this medicine."
