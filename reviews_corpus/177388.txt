"I had moderate depression, crushing anxiety, and probably fibromyalgia. (I&#039;ve never pursed fibro testing due to no health insurance.) One week ago I just could not go on. Depression, anxiety, and all-over aches and stiffness stopped me in my tracks. One day on 30 mg Cymbalta and it all cleared up. I could not believe it. It is a miracle for me. I&#039;ve been on it one full week and am now over the slight nausea, dizziness, and dry mouth. YaY! :-)"
