"I have been on 10mg of Lexapro (generic version) since 2012. It has helped me a great deal. I was prescribed the med for generalized anxiety which used to impair my ability to function - I could not sleep at all, extended period of sleep deprivation would trigger depression which was hell. I experienced panic attacks just as I would start to fall asleep; it would jolt me up and never able to fall back to sleep.  I could not eat and lost a lot of weight. I got a very good doctor and he prescribed a sleeping aid with lexapro until lexapro&#039;s anti-anxiety effects kicked it. I took the sleeping aid for about 5-6 weeks until I started to sleep 4-5 hours. One big adverse side effect is weight gain.gained 25 pounds in 3 years."
