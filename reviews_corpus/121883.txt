"My doctor prescribed this for my anxiety due to perimenopause, 37 mg.  I was always tired on it so he increased it to 75mg xr.  I&#039;m not as tired as I used to be and I no longer wake with anxiety and can sleep through the night.  My energy level is not as high as it used to be before Effexor.  My appetite has also increased.  I&#039;ve heard this can be due to a combination of the Effexor and menopause.  If I skip a dose, I get headaches."
