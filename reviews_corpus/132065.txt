"I can&#039;t believe how much this medicine helps.  Something tramatic happened to me last May which made me very anxious and my doctor tried to prescribe this but my insurance company is notorious for turning down any medicine that does not have a generic. Finally in October (after trying many other medicines) I was prescribed Effexor.  Although the underlying issues are still there for me, I am myself again."
