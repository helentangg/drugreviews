"I started on Monday taking Escitalopram drops. My doctor told me to take 10 drops  (10 mg). I read the instructions and opted to take 5 drops  (5mg) as the drug was new to me and I&#039;m a very little lady and was worried about the dose. Within a few hours I had the most throbbing headache that wiped me out all day. The following morning I took another 5 drops and again had a throbbing headache. I took various over the counter medicines to rid myself of this headache but nothing worked. Luckily a friend popped over and I made an espresso coffee for us both. Within 5 minutes of drinking the coffee my headache had disappeared completely. I was relieved and shocked that a dose of caffeine could put me back in the land of living again."
