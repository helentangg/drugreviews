"Not trusting the source (s) of reviews of this medication from &#039;company-friendly&#039; sites, hope this one actually gets published.
Zoloft was a nightmare, nine-day experience.  Kept reading the &#039;keep taking it!&#039; reviews and those were simply not true to me.  Most everyone will eventually cycle back to feeling much better, especially if they have support.
Zoloft will push you over the edge if you keep taking it.
Had every side effect - bizarre urination flow, horrible gas, insomnia, etc.
Would suggest people considering Zoloft to stick with something short-term and short-acting.  Feel better and wean yourself off and don&#039;t let one quack doctor talk you out of that mindset."
