"I had been on and off this drug for years and it significantly improved my depression and anxiety. It also helped me sleep (I took it at night because it made me nauseous). Unfortunately, it also contributed to weight gain, so I switched to Prozac and it made a big difference. On Zoloft now because Prozac gave me fog and I think it&#039;s my happy medium for now."
