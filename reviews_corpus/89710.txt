"I went on 20mg of Celexa following a nervous breakdown my senior year of high school. Into my first semester at college, I realized that while I was on this medicine, I just didn&#039;t care about anything. I was lethargic and tired all of the time and I could never participate in my classes. I went on for a while being almost completely unaware of my surroundings until I started experimenting a little with it. I would go off of it for a few days and when I begun feeling down again, I would resume. Obviously, this had horrible consequences and I found myself in the acute care department the night before my calculus midterm. Following the incident, I went to my doctor and insisted that I be phased off Celexa and since then, have been fine."
