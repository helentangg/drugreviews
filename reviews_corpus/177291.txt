"I took this drug for GAD. Of course it did its job. 

BUT PLEASE READ ABOUT ITS WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS BEFORE STARTING!!! 

I have stopped taking it 4 days ago and you can&#039;t imagine the things I am going through. I remember before taking it, I read reviews about this drug. And one of the reviews wrote &#039;DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG. IT IS HELL&#039; and I was like why so dramatic. And oh boy was he not!! I am reading about how to reduce the withdrawal symptoms. And after reading the users who are trying to stop Cymbalta on this page https://www.drugs.com/answers/long-cymbalta-withdrawals-747877.html?page=2, I found out that I have a long way to go. 

Please be careful."
