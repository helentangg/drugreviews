"I have been on Pristiq for about a year now, I have depression, and rage disorder, I have been a lot better but recently I am starting to feel as though I just don&#039;t care to go on. I am not sure if I am developing a tolerance to the drug but I am starting to worry about getting the blues completely back. I had an episode recently where I went straight to rage, no being upset or mad, just straight to aggression. I yelled and screamed but did not hurt anyone. I have not felt like this since before Pristiq. I am only posting this to warn of what may be down the road for some. I have an appointment with my doctor to see what is next. Just when I thought this was over."
