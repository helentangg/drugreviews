"I have severe  constant pain all over from rheumatoid arthritis which has me so crippled in my back, hands, fingers, shoulders, hips, ankles and knees. I am unable to walk and use a walker.  I also have fibromyalgia which causes much pain and mental confusion  sometimes.  My Rheumatologist started me on 10 mg of Lexipro at first two years ago . I felt a bit drowsy for a couple of weeks until my body got used to the medicine.   About four months ago had a hip replacement  and a nightmare arthritis flare up.  The flare up has not subsided yet , so my doctor increased the Lexapro to 20mg each morning and 20 mg each night.  I take it about 8 pm  a little before bed time. 
I haven&#039;t noticed any additional side effects .  This drug helps me."
