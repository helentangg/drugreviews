"I have been taking 40 mg of Celexa now for the past 2 weeks. I can tell quite a change in my personality and it&#039;s for the better. It&#039;s literally saving my relationship. I have experienced the nausea, but the positive is that it&#039;s helping me lose some unwanted weight that I put on from previous medications. Overall I think that it&#039;s a great medication."
