"I&#039;ve been diagnosed with chronic insomnia and general anxiety for 9 years. I also suffer from depression, but refuse to be medicated directly for it (specifically SSRI&#039;s) after dealing with Paxil and the horrible withdrawal I experienced 8 years ago. So recently I was prescribed 30mg Doxepin in addition to my Zolpidem (Ambien) for my insomnia. My insomnia has slightly improved, but more pronounced has been the reduction in both occurrence and severity of my anxiety (within the first week) and depression (after about 3-4 weeks). It&#039;s been about 6 weeks since I started the doxepin and haven&#039;t noticed any negative side effects besides some dry mouth/eyes, which is far outweighed by the benefits I&#039;ve received."
