"I&#039;d had a bad experience trying an SSRI for anxiety (made me feel very ill!) so I tried 10mg of amitriptilyne every night. I didn&#039;t think 10mg would do much for me but it&#039;s incredible how it&#039;s worked. It worked straight away in relaxing me and although groggy, I now have no anxiety! I feel like my old self again. The doctor said this isn&#039;t possible as it&#039;s not a high enough dose but it&#039;s worked for me so I&#039;m going to carry on.
I do wonder if all I needed was more sleep but whatever it is, it&#039;s worked for me. I do plan on increasing the dosage as recommended by my doctor but after 20mg I felt extremely tired so I think I tried it too soon. I&#039;ve been on it just over a month now so maybe I&#039;ll try again now."
