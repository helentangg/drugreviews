"After having a heart attack I became very depressed.  I have been on Lexapro, Zoloft, Xanax, Ativan, Wellbutrin, and Buspar.  None worked and I attempted suicide.  I have Major depession and anxiety disorder, so take my comments in stride.  The right drug for you is out there along with intensive therapy.  I was switched to Effexor XR while in &quot;the funny farm.&quot;  After the typical waiting period for it to kick in, I can tell you I am a new man, looking at life like I used to.  It has saved my life and my family.

It hasn&#039;t done much for anxiety, so for the first few months after my severe &quot;episode&quot; I was on Seroquel. I have now been switched to clonazepam for that issue.  Please consult a proper medical person."
