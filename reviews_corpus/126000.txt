"Depressed yes, Been seeing my LCSW for a while told me i needed a SSR so off i went to my PCP and he told me to try Viibryd, I am 53 Male (no ED yet :)), high blood pressure medication, and back pain 5mg oxicotin 2 times a day as needed..I take this medication at 7:00 at night.. Sleeping was a problem the first two nights now i am sleeping a little better (any sound seem to wake me).. Medication seems to be working ok just finished the first week 10mg, seem to be getting a little throbbing on the right side of my head not a constant throbbing off and on during the day . .  Will update after the second week is finished"
