"Started taking Prozac about 6 months ago.  I&#039;m taking care of my 82 year old mother who has Dementia and I found my stress and anxiety going through the roof, many sleepless nights too.  The positives are that I sleep much better, my anxiety is pretty much gone and I&#039;m much calmer and I&#039;m handling my mother so much better.  The negatives are: no motivation at all - photography is my passion but I have not picked up a camera since started this medicine. I find myself grinding my teeth all the time.  Loss of libido, the worst thing out of it though was that I lost weight, I weighed 98 pounds but lost 13 pounds within the first month and can&#039;t seem to get it back. I&#039;m now at 89 pounds and look terrible!.I&#039;m going back to doctor next week."
