"I was first diagnosed with depression in 1999, and was put on meds.  My life was better than normal, and I was very happy.  This fall, however, the meds just stopped working.  I was put on Escitaloram (after another medication did not work) three days ago, and I can feel it working already.  I believe in this medication, and I feel you should give it a try."
