"Made me feel really numb emotionally as well as sexually... I felt like I couldn&#039;t cry or be anxious anymore but I couldn&#039;t laugh, really be happy or feel passion for life anymore.  Please be careful if you decide to go off this medication as you will probably feel strange electrical-like buzzy feelings in your brain as I did. They last a few days but were every unnerving and I sometimes felt like I was going to pass out.. So be sure you don&#039;t go cold turkey.  It did work for me in that it gave me a break from my obsessions, sadness, worries. And it did so for a long time. "
