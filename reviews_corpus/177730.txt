"I have been taking 120mg of Cymbalta, daily, since it was first introduced &amp; I couldn&#039;t be more satisfied with its results. I was diagnosed with severe, clinical, depression, approximately 15 years ago &amp; all antidepressants prescribed to me, prior to Cymbalta, worked for a year, before they completely stopped working for me. I&#039;ve tried every SSRI available &amp; the same thing would happen, every time, UNTIL Cymbalta became available. I have no negative side effects, never have, &amp; Im so very grateful for them."
