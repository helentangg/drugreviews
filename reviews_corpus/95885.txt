"I was diagnosed with PMDD and prescribed cyclical Sertraline.  I can remember the day I started my period thinking how did that happen without all the stress anger and drama.  I aliken it to having gas and air during labour.  It just takes the top off the emotion and prevents the explosive outbursts of uncontrollable anger.  I honestly thought i just had normal pmt until I saw my doctor, who upon asking me a list of questions, said the only one id replied no to was suicidal thoughts but it probably wouldnt be too long before I got there.  Apart from a nasty headache on day 2/3 this drug has literally saved my family life."
