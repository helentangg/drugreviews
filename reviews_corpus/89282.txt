"This medication is truly a double edge sword. This is only my personal experience with this drug. I liked it but won&#039;t be recommending it due to sexual and other side effects.
The positive: It works like a dream...as far as mood it will make you extremely mellow and easy going. 
The negative: It will make you shake-tremors. You will still have somewhat of a sex drive but impossible to achieve an orgasm. Weight gain, stomach cramps, restless and trouble sleeping."
