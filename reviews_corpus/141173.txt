"I have been taking Lexapro for 5 weeks now. In the first two weeks I thought it was having a positive affect on my moods, anxiety and depression. However, in the last 3 weeks, I seem to have reverted back and may have even regressed further back before I even started taking the drug. I have had more suicidal thoughts, desire to be left alone, high anxieties, extreme mood swings, and no motivation. I feel alone, with no hope. I have less interest in things I enjoy now than i did before taking Lexapro. My doctor told me that it would take 4-6 weeks for the medication to realize it&#039;s full effect/potential. Entering my 6th week, it&#039;s time for me and my doctor to consider alternatives."
