"Been having worsening migraines for 8 or more years. Tried so many different things, I am basically disabled at this point sick almost daily from either migraine or rebound day. After Topamax, steroids, beta blockers, you name it I&#039;ve tried it. Finally I&#039;ve been put on nortriptyline, after 2 weeks I haven&#039;t had a single migraine. I hate to be skeptical but it&#039;s almost too good to believe for me since I&#039;ve been sick so long, so I will be reporting back soon. But I even feel differently just how my brain feels. Right now I&#039;m quite thrilled and the results seem to be what&#039;s reported by everyone else here (taking 25mg at night)."
