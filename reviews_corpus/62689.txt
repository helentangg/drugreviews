"I started taking Celexa in Nov &#039;08 and continued it for seven months.  My depression disappeared and I was doing a whole lot better. Normality returned and I had no side effects other than a little weight gain which may not have been due to the drug.  I was eating popcorn every night!  Anyway, since I felt better I decided to stop taking it in May 09.  Well, my depression returned. It&#039;s funny, this time I felt it coming on but didn&#039;t do anything about it until it was full blown.  I started taking Celexa again three days ago (Aug 23) and, poof!  Most of my poor mood is gone and I feel so much better already. I&#039;m not stopping again.  This medicine is great!"
