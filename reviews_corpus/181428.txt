"This is my third medication I&#039;ve tried for my anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder. I was first on fluvoxamine and Klonopin and those did nothing but make me a zombie. A month into Prozac while I was feeling the side effects of dizziness and whatnot everything just turned back on. Literally it&#039;s like someone turned the lights on. All I can say is it takes time, don&#039;t be discouraged. Also pay attention to what you take with it. I was on Zoloft and was getting extremely dizzy. Prozac doesn&#039;t agree with certain medications and definitely not caffeine. 
For the most part though I went from having panic attacks so bad they felt like heart attacks to being completely calm and &quot;normal&quot;."
