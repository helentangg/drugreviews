"I started on Paxil late 1990s for panic disorders and depression...I am 5&#039;6&quot; and was about 118lbs. Stayed on Paxil about 4 years and came off because I wanted to get pregnant.  It saved my life truly I felt great and I was able to enjoy driving again, going to the mall, able to take an elevator, able to stay at home alone, wait on lines at supermarkets, work without fear of losing it, etc.  after coming off very slowly the good effects lasted about a year. However, while on Paxil I gained 60lbs. After my son was born in 2004 I had postpartum depression so again went back in Paxil it didn&#039;t work as good as the first time but it helped get me back to feeling just alright.  Came off again due to more weight gain."
