"I have been on Pristiq (50 mg) for about four months to treat depression. I feel better and have more energy, but some side-effects I&#039;ve encountered concern me. When I missed a dose, it sounded like fireworks were going off in my head. I could hear &quot;zaps&quot; and felt dizzy and nauseated. I didn&#039;t connect it to the medication, though, so I stayed in bed the next day, unmedicated, and the symptoms got worse. I was able to see the physician&#039;s assistant who prescribed phenergan and valium. I&#039;m now a little worried about going off Pristiq. I never felt like this on Paxil or Effexor."
