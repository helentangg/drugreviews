"I was prescribed Zoloft in late of 2008 and I have been on it ever since.  I have a minor case if OCD which is all in my head. I tend to be obsessive with repetitive thoughts and if I don&#039;t think about it then I basically freak out with anxiety. I know it&#039;s so weird, but I guess God made everyone unique in their own way. 
Anyway, did Zoloft help me? I must say definitely YES. Although my OCD does come back from time to time, it is no where nearly as bad now compared to how it used to be. The repetitive thoughts have decreased by about 80% and that is more then I can ever ask for. However, I experience weird side effects when I forget to take it like nausea, light headedness and &quot;brain zaps.&quot; Got to take the good with the bad I guess."
