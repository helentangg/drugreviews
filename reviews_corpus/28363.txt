"Life changing medicine for panic disorder and anxiety.  Zero side effects save for slight insomnia on days 1-3 and a bit of muscle weirdness and stomach pain (similar to ibuprofen) in week 1.  Most days I am a normal person now.  Still supplement with clonazepam for trigger situations on occasion, but most of the time I can focus on life without panic distracting me."
