"I&#039;ve had anxiety and panic attacks for many years.  I&#039;ve tried diet and exercise,meditiation, herbs, and when I finally realized how many things I was missing out on with my family and friends I knew I needed to try medicine.  First I tried Buspar which offered no help and made me really dizzy. Next was Lexapro.  
    The first couple of days on Lexapro i noticed nothing. By day 4 I was really tired and had a headache. Day 5-6 was the same and I was very anxious and couldn&#039;t sleep.  By this point i am so tired I have to sleep late, sleep at lunch and go to bed early.  On day 8-10 my ears rang and I almost gave up. On day 11 I FINALLY started to feel better.  Waiting for 4 weeks to see full benefits, but the side effects DO go away."
