"Took this for social anxiety. After about a month on the pill my anxiety was gone. However, there were some side effects that I didn&#039;t like. My sexual functions (male) were completely gone which scared me. But after a couple months on the pill I could get by...but it&#039;s never as good on the pill as it is off the pill. Also I ground my teeth at night a LOT. I gained weight too...but that could be because I ate terribly, so we&#039;ll call that my fault. After a year on this pill, I stopped taking it. Having my social anxiety gone while on the pill built up my confidence a lot, and now I do fine in social situations with no pill needed. I recommend this pill for social anxiety. "
