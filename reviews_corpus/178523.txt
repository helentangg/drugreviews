"I have been suffering with serious depression for the last year. I was on a different medication. I gained a lot of weight from eating without thinking(compulsive), and started to feel the social aniexty again. Honestly I was very hesitant about starting Cymbalta because I had read all the side effects, but I have had almost none. I drink lots of water all day long so that might have something to do with it. I got control of my appetite again."
