"Besides extreme sweating (soaking thru tee shirts) 24/7 I don&#039;t see what it does for pain besides NOTHING, the feeling of I don&#039;t give a rats ass about my life is another fun filled side effect. I&#039;ve been on it almost a yr, take 30 mg in the morning before going to bed &amp; 60 late in the day. I&#039;m thinking of weaning myself off it, I&#039;d rather take Xanax twice a day."
