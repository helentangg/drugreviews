"I suffered from anxiety, obsessive thoughts due to anxiety, and depression as a result. I had thoughts in my head that I tried to suppress and the thoughts just came back stronger. I thought that I was completely helpless and began to have suicidal thoughts. I started on Zoloft (first on 25mg then 50mg) and it helped with my depression and anxiety, except it made me really sleepy. My doctor suggested Lexapro at 10mg and I have been on it for about 5 weeks now. My condition has improved tremendously! I am happier and my thoughts aren&#039;t overpowering my life. I started CBT and that has helped as well. DO NOT GIVE UP. Things will get better, I promise. I thought the medicine wouldn&#039;t work for me, but it does."
