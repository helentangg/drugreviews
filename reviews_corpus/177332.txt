"I took duloxetine for 90 days. It helped reduce my pain enough that I could stop most opioids, but drug side effects were worse than the pain. I had dry mouth, then nausea which went on every day until about a month after I stopped it. I woke up in a panic sometimes, after horrible nightmares which I hadn&#039;t had before. I began teeth grinding, chipped many teeth, and was advised to have a mouth guard made. My headaches worsened markedly. My blood pressure rose substantially. I itched, sweated, and passed gas horribly. I had difficulty passing urine. My doctor had no idea how to help me; all I would be told was to &quot;drink ginger tea&quot;. Stopping it was hellish, with shaking, wide blood pressure swings, and painful brain zaps."
