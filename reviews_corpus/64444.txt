"It took a couple of weeks to start working, during that time I was using diazepam to until it was working,this helped with sleep to. Only down side is libido, there is none,if you do have some. I could not orgasm. 
    Thats all changed now for the better,were I was mentally sex was not important.
The first time I was in my 30s on medication for 8 months. Was ok for 5 years, then I messed up by over working { IE  lack of sleep working long hours } I was back to square one. Been on medication for 10 years though I have lowered the dosage a lot,now having problems geting of diazepam though I am taken only 2mg twice a day."
