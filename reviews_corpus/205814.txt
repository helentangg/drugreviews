"I have been on almost every antidepressant and bipolar medication there is and Pristiq is the first one where I don&#039;t hear everyone telling me how much better I act yet don&#039;t feel better in my head. I actually feel better and have less manic episodes, the only down of it is that my insomnia has gotten worse but I can deal with lack of sleep if it means not feeling the way I did!"
