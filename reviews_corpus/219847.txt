"Since being on amitriptyline my IBS symptoms are pretty much not there. I used to be in horrific pain all day everyday and would even feel hot, dizzy and in so much pain that I would actually faint off the toilet. I didn&#039;t want to leave the house and IBS literally took over my life. I never write any reviews like this but if I can help even just one IBS sufferer then it&#039;s worth it. I gradually increased my dose to 50mg per night. Seems like a lot but it&#039;s worth it in order to live a normal 21 year old girls life. For the first week I did get the side effects (tired, dry mouth, a bit faint) but after that I felt absolutely fine again. Please try this drug, I didn&#039;t think it would work but it did and I have honestly never been happier!"
