"My Doctor is bad and suggested this medicine. I&#039;ve tried lots of different ones nothing has helped in 10 yrs. She stated it would help my pain , hot flashes and menopause. I came home took a 37.5  mg at 8pm and by 11 pm I was sick -  my stomach hurt so bad  I vomited and  I was hot / cold , my pupils were dilated ,  I could not control my emotions or my stomach , I threw up againe.  I&#039;ve been a nervous wreak for 36 hrs.  I woke up with a terrible  right side headache, muscle ache in my jaw or my right eye, feeling sick to my stomach.  I only took 1 pill its the worst medication , ever , I&#039;ve been on lots of meds , but nothing has ever done this. I do not recommend this pill to anyone.  I&#039;m just trying to get it out of my system , please read all reviews before you try it."
