"I was worried that sertraline wouldn&#039;t work for me because they say the effects are different for everyone but its actually been going very well. I&#039;ve been using sertraline for about 4 months now. It did take awhile to notice any changes in my mood but after a month or so I realized how great I was doing. Not only does it help me for my depression but it has helped just as much with my anxiety. I no longer feel overly sensitive/upset about minor things but I haven&#039;t lost touch with my emotions. My overall mood has made a 180. Not having bad anxiety has especially made my life so much better. I just feel well balanced and think clearer and more reasonably instead of drowning in my depression."
