"I battled with Bipolar I since 1992 but never experience major depression until mid-2009 and it was terrible, lots of crying, despair, horrible guilt, just hating myself.  I tried 2-3 anti-depressant when I finally found a M.D. who would let me try one (they are so concerned you will spiral up into a manic attack).  I then tried Cymbalta (60mg) and the depression is most days just gone.  I have had some bad days like everyone; a few times when crying, regretting etc. would start, it seems it was capped off and subsided quickly. I continue to have significant constipation and hand tremor. I eat a lot more fiber in my diet and take 2 natural fiber pills a day to help with the constipation. Cutting back on caffeine helps the hand tremor."
