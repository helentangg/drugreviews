"I&#039;ve now been on Paroxetine for about 10 years, for severe, chronic depression. I was on Prozac for roughly 15 years before it appeared to lose its effectiveness, so I was prescribed this instead. My initial dose was 40mg daily. It was initially extremely effective as an anti-depressant, and I went from being hospitalized for a week every year for my own safety, to 6 years without a hospitalization. Just a &#039;blip&#039; in mood every year instead of a crash. However, I&#039;m now on 80mg, and the side-effects at this dose are appalling - chronic insomnia, 100lb weight gain, constant tiredness, muscle aches, migraines, memory loss, zero libido and all-round apathy. Attempting to drop my dosage results in uncontrollable weeping, numbness and terror."
