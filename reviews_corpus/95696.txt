"Zoloft is a very good medication for anxiety and depression.  For me better with anxiety.  I am BiPolar I, am also on Zyban 150 a day. Taking these two medications together is fine as is also taking when you are BiPolar.  Only with a specialists direction, though.  I have been on Zoloft a couple of times the only side effect before was severe diarrhea.  This time when I started taking it I got butterflies in the stomach and flutters, but over time this unusual for me side effect left me.    Some say how many weeks to feel a impact. For me this last time was around 6 weeks. Which is normal. It&#039;s been proven that any time prior 4 weeks is most likely placebo effect.  But if you feel better well, whether a placebo effect or not, it&#039;s good."
