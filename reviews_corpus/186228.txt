"The first few weeks were not pleasant but soon after the Pristiq started to help regulate my mood, it made me less likely to be anxious angry or sad.  Basically it made me not really care...about much of anything.  It did help me leave a bad relationship which I believe was the source of much of my anxiety.  3-4 months in and I an now growing tired of feeling so &quot;blah&quot; all the time...I am planning to taper after the Thanksgiving holiday so hopefully I am back to normal around mid December.  I am not looking forward to the discontinuation symptoms - i.e. withdrawals."
