"I&#039;ve been on trintellix now for over a month. I&#039;ve been on many meds for depression and anxiety. This one seems to work quite a bit on depression, but not anxiety. I had a bit of nausea in the beginning, but started taking the pill before bed and that seemed to work for me. I did have some constipation issues that were actually quite painful, but it only last a few days. Overall this medication does work faster than most I&#039;ve been on. I just wish it worked for my anxiety as well."
