"I was prescribed Zoloft by my doctor to treat my depression/anxiety (small, 25mg dosage) and after about 4 days in I am experiencing all of the mild side effects including; insomnia, lack of appetite/motivation, foggy head, achiness and exhaustion. I&#039;m 19 and around 125lb, was just wondering if anyone experienced anything similar? *aka is this normal and does it get better*

(Note- it is more of a grieving depression due to the death of a parent. I believe my DR. said I&#039;m going through some transition dilemma, so a low dosage is all I need)"
