"Overall, I am very happy with Sertraline. Before I started taking this medication, I was taking Passion Flower, which is a vitamin to help with stress. Although it did work, it wasn&#039;t enough. It was at the point where I needed to be on medication for health reasons. My heart was becoming more and more irregular and my anxiety was through the roof. I am 18 years old and a college student, and with 50mg dosage of Sertraline once a day, my heart rate has been able to become regular and my stress is far less than it used to be. I definitely recommend this for anyone who has anxiety when it comes to social fear or just daily stress."
