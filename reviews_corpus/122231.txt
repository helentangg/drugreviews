"Just came from the doctor after &quot;weening myself&quot; to 75 mg of Effexor. Bad move, doctor put me back to 150mg. Doctor put me on Buspar with my Effexor. FANTASTIC. Haven&#039;t felt this good in years, but I felt so good I thought I could get off the Effexor. Lesson here, if you feel better, don&#039;t stop taking your medicines, it&#039;s working. Ask your doctor about taking Buspar with the Effexor. I have never felt better. No more racing thoughts, etc. Now, just waiting for Effexor to work it&#039;s way back into my system. As for coupling it with the Buspar - RIGHT ON THE MONEY."
