"I had very little pain reduction with this medication. I was taking it at 120mg/day by the time I was switched. I had very little side effects, but it did affect my libido and sexual performance. I also found I did not have much creative drive while I was on the medication, which was one of the primary reasons I asked to be switched. It might have reduced my pain by a point on the 1-10 scale, but that simply wasn&#039;t worth it, especially at a $320/mo cost with no insurance."
