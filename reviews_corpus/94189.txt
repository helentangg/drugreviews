"I suspected sexual side effects from Lexapro so my doctor switched me to Brintellix. It made me itch like crazy every single night even though I took it in the morning. There wasn&#039;t a rash or anything so I just felt like I was losing my mind and my doctor hadn&#039;t heard of the side effect. I also got pretty nauseous on a few occasions. 
It was not nearly as effective as Lexapro for depression. While on Brintellix I found myself getting devastated by things that would have been minor disappointments while I was on Lexapro. On Brintellix I cried a few times at work. I got really frustrated with people over nothing. I lost a lot of motivation. I wasn&#039;t myself.
I&#039;ve heard it works for other people, but not me."
