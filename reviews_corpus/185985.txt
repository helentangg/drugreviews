"I couldn&#039;t be happier with Pristiq as it has helped me get back in the game of life again. I started taking Pristiq six weeks ago, following its recommendations and those who have had success on it. While on daily Pristiq, I also do 30 minutes of exercise (rebounding, walking, swimming), drink 2 litres of water, only 1 cup of  coffee/ tea a day and no alcohol. Regular bedtime/risetime (8 hours min sleep). Quick results help me to persevere for 3 weeks to form new habits and get control of my life again.  The rebounding offset my dizziness, nausea, sluggishness, constipation and &quot;I-don&#039;t-feel-like-it&quot;s.  Pristiq and a healthier lifestyle have me feeling like my old self again, enjoying life, friendships, good health and work again."
