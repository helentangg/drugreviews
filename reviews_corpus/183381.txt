"Been on 30mg Cymbalta 1x/day for just a week. Helps a lot with my back pain, almost like its not there and I don&#039;t obsess about it constantly. I&#039;ve had 2 lower back surgeries for herniated disks over the past 15 years. So far a wonder drug with only minimal nausea at first and some fatigue. Never took any other medicines except Aleve in the past, but that just didn&#039;t cut it."
