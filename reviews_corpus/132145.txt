"This is the best medication I have ever taken! I am a 18 year old College student, suffering from Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, Mood Disorder, and Depression and I cannot fathom as to how much this medication has helped my life. The first two weeks of taking it I could notice differences in how I socially interacted with people (much more out-going and easy-going). Now I&#039;ve been on the medicine for two months and I will NEVER stop taking it! I have absolutely no problems anymore, I still can sometimes work myself up every now and then but I&#039;m prescribed to 0.5mg of Klonopin for onset anxiety. The only thing I can say bad about this medicine is that I crash at the end of the day for about an hour, and then have disrupted sleep."
