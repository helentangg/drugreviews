"Day two and I&#039;m feeling a little weird but better than yesterday. I&#039;m on 50 mg to start. I&#039;ve been on Zoloft before and don&#039;t remember feeling like this. Last time I felt better almost instantly. I been off it for about 6 years. I&#039;ll stick with it this time because I know it does work."
