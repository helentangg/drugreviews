"I had forgotten that I had PMDD!  I was prescribed citalopram for considerable anxiety and mild depression while I was going through a nasty divorce.  I have been on citalopram for a few years now, since about January 2014.  I forgot to pick up repeat prescription and I thought as divorce now finished (June 2015) and all good with my life (even accepting normal trial and tribulations of difficult hormonal teenager!)  I would be fine and should just get on with it and not worry about taking it anymore.  Wow, was I wrong, period overdue and  PMDD back as it was at its worst.  Needless to say will be back at docs to discuss and continue as there is no way I will come off this until I am post menopausal (soon but until then citalopram)."
