"Finally I see hope.

After being diagnosed with severe depression (took me 4 years to seek treatment), I tried 5 different medications (plus therapy). They all failed miserably and I lost the hope I didn&#039;t even know I had, then tried suicide twice. Finally I was prescribed Pristiq and let me just say... what a difference!
It got easier to wake up and get through the day, my self-esteem got better, my anxiety doesn&#039;t come as often, and I can even make plans for the future. For the first time I see change is possible.
Just don&#039;t ever forget to take your pills, you can&#039;t really function without them. I got no side effects except for increased hunger/libido, and a bit of difficulty falling asleep.
I&#039;m taking 150mg now."
