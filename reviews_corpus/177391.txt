"18 year old female. I&#039;ve been on duloxetine for three months now, currently on the maximum dose of 120 mg, and it&#039;s had an amazing effect. I&#039;m happier, more productive, and more motivated. It&#039;s done a great job with fixing my energy levels and memory, and I enjoy my hobbies more. Overall, very good experience- however, on days I forget to take my medicine, I can experience a dull, stabbing pain in my hands and feet, similar to symptoms of peripheral neuropathy, though I&#039;ve yet to receive a diagnosis. I can&#039;t be sure that this is a side effect of the medication, as the pain subsides when I&#039;m regularly taking it, but I would suggest making sure you take it as regularly as prescribed, especially at high doses."
