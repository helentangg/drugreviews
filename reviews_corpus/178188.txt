"Been on Cymbalta for about 3 months now. I took off one notch for the rating because I seem to break out a little bit. Also I&#039;ve noticed a slight decrease in libido.
Other than that, this has been a true miracle for me. I am able to hold down a job, I&#039;ve gotten my finances in order, and I&#039;ve never gotten along so well with my girlfriend. 
For me, I take the 60 mg Cymbalta first thing in the morning at around the same time. I am really thankful to finally be able to have some sort of STABILITY in my life. "
