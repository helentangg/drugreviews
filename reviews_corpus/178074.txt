"I suffer from major depression and was placed on Cymbalta 6 yrs ago. I took myself off against my doctor&#039;s advice. Life became hopeless and all I though about was wanting to die. Now I&#039;ve been back on it for 18 days and I&#039;m on top of the world. The future looks bright and I&#039;m certainly enjoying the present!"
