"Been on 10mg trintellex for 9 days after weening off Zoloft 150mg over a month
Really feel much better on trintellex but I have itchy skin and hives. I got hives on one side of face the first day now they move around . Take hydroxizine which has helped some
Going to stop trintellex and start back on Zoloft to see if hives go away per Dr suggestion. Has anyone else gotten hives and do they go away over time. If I knew they would go away I would stick with it a little longer"
