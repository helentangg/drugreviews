"I have been taking Cymbalta for over a year now.  I suffer(ed) from perimenopausal symptoms (PMS) including debilitating depression/suicidal ideation.  I have never been a person who thought about suicide although I have suffered from dysthymia for years. Cymbalta has been a life-saver.  I am very grateful. No depression, little anxiety, no side effects."
