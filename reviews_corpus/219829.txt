"Works ok.  I have Bulge discs, tear, depression &amp; anxiety .  On this I   sleep well. Loss of sex drive, anxiety and stress still high. Doesn&#039;t help the pain so much in my back. I sleep really well at night after 100mg, but I wake up tired and need to nap for 2-3 hours and in bed by 9:30pm. Just always wanting to sleep and lazy."
