"I was severely depressed before deciding to try this medication. I recently graduated (May 10) with my second B.S.  I am also a mother. I knew before that I wasn&#039;t happy like I should be.  I never ever was proud of my accomplishments, it was difficult for me to do daily tasks and play with my daughter.  I was never happy. When I graduated with my bio degree, I sunk really low, the weight above my head felt like a building was being held on top of me.  A friend suggested depression. I decided to talk to my doctor about it and we gave Paxil a try.  I felt better almost immediately.  Within 1 week I can honestly say the weight was gone and I felt better than I have in a REALLY long time. It has changed my life! Highly recommend!"
