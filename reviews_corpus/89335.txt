"I&#039;ve taken this medication for about 3:years now. Back when I was diagnosed with major depression one of the first medications I tried was celexa. It helped me out of a very bad place. Like every medication it has its side effects, but compared to other medications they are minimal. This medication, along with exercise and a healthy diet, helped turn my life around. There are no side effects worth mentioning besides mind drowsiness and a lack of energy on higher doses. If you feel stuck I would highly recommend celexa your first choice for meds"
