"After taking Cymbalta for 3 weeks I become gradually more nervous, by 4 and 1/2 weeks I felt like I was having a constant panic attack. I felt terrified all the time but I couldn&#039;t even tell you what I was terrified of. It was the most horrible feeling I&#039;ve ever experienced. My doctor insisted that I increase the dose but I refused. I finally argued with him and demanded to be taken off. I&#039;ve been looking for someone else that experienced a similar reaction."
