"Yeah, Paxil definitely saved my arse really.  I tried prozac first and went totally off the rails with anxiety and 2 days on paxil and I slept and knew that it was the one for me.  I am a fool though because I keep trying to come off it because it works so well for anxiety.  I have been reduced to 10 mg&#039;s from 20 and have been enjoying that but noticed that my mind fluctuates between optimism and pessimism really quite quickly.  The mind is a strange thing.  Anyway, it keeps me grounded, no panic attacks, no anxiety.  Amazing how we all react so differently to these various SSRI&#039;s.  Pity about the sex drive with Paxil.  I fall in love still but I don&#039;t have that physical thing going off like people off antidepressants do."
