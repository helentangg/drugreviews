"Paxil DOES work to stop panic attacks and general anxiety symptoms. I&#039;ve had no panic attacks while on it. But my problem with Paxil are its&#039; side effects. I was on Paxil for a few years and had gained weight steadily at the same time. I was trying to lose weight while on Paxil and was unsuccessful, but I didn&#039;t blame the Paxil. I went off of Paxil and changed nothing else in my routine &amp; lost 25 pounds in 3 months! I ended up having to go back on it and gained ALL of it back within 1 MONTH. I tried to up my exercise and diet routine to make up for the Paxil, but I can&#039;t get the scale to budge more than 5 pounds down. Also, when trying to get off Paxil, the side effects are AWFUL. Wean off VERY SLOWLY! Worst, most addictive SSRI out there."
