"This is my second time taking Prozac. I took it for two years before for panic attacks, insomnia, OCD and it did wonders.  After a month my head cleared up,  my memory improved as well as my sleep. (No longer waking up in the middle of the night worried about things).  Only downside is that I tend to gain a lot of weight on it. As soon as I stopped last time the weight came off almost immediately. I plan to watch what I eat and exercise more this time. After a month now I have already started feel 2000% better and sleeping sooo good."
