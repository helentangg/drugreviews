"on Citalopram 3 weeks this time (was on it previously for GAD and panic for 3 years, stopped it as I felt better). Lot of issues recently, bereavement/stress, and the old GAD and panic returned - ably assisted by also going through the menopause!  Given the option of HRT or Citalopram I opted for the later.  First 2 weeks were shaky to say the least but now feeling so much better.  Mood has stabilised, sex drive not too bad, but eating so much more. Need to watch weight gain as have only just lost the 2 and a half stone I gained when previously on Citalopram!  This change has occurred with only being on 10 mg.  Hope to stay on this low dose, for ever if I have to, feel so much better."
