"I have been taking Effexor XR for about 3 years now. While I still suffer panic attacks and suffer symptoms like rapid heart palpitations, poor blood circulation in the fingers, excessive sweating of the hands, and hyperventilation, I do find the medication limits these experiences. This medication hasn&#039;t solved all my problems, but it has been incredibly beneficial in helping me advance my career and has aided my social life."
