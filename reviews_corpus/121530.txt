"So I had been on 75mg in the past for about a year and hadn&#039;t faised me to stop taking, anyway years later I found myself extremely depressed to the point I had thought all past experiences of being depressed were nothing in comparison. I went on 75mg to begin with, then 150mg which worked great for me until i too wanted to stop taking after a while because I felt I was at a different point in my life, just missing one day of this drug gives you hell I had bad head aches and a zapping feeling like a wasn&#039;t completely sane. So after much research and deciding to tackle this a different way, I have been taking 150mg every second day and 75mg ever other Opposite Day, I&#039;ve had barely any side effects, I can&#039;t wait to finally be effexor free!!"
