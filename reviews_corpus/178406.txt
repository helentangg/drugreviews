"I have been taking Cymbalta for 3 months now to combat depression and anxiety. I am taking 30mg per day. When I first started taking it I was very sleepy. I had to take naps during the day which wasn&#039;t too good. I finally had a breakthrough with it and now no longer need the naps. I had good side effects for a few weeks like no hunger pangs. Those went away. I haven&#039;t gained any weight either like I did on Zoloft and Serazone. I feel great and during my PMS now it is so nice to actually be nice to others again. It is a wonderful medicine. Keep taking it and you will feel better. The sleepiness will go away and the sun will start shining again. I laugh again like I used to and I have NO SEXUAL SIDE EFFECTS yeah."
