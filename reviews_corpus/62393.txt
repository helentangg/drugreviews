"I am taking it for anxiety and depression and have experienced a lot of yawning and nausea. I feel energized in the morning than the energy seems to drain out of me but once I find something to keep me busy like walking my dogs/exercising I feel much better. Overall I feel good taking this medicine. I feel more positive and I am not thinking of the things about my loss that it could have been my fault that caused it. "
