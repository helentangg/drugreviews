"I used to be a paratrooper but as I aged I developed anxieties that eventually interfered with my daily life.  For example I became terrified of flying, driving in winter, or crossing bridges.  I got to the point where I would cross a bridge and even though I knew my fears were irrational, I felt like I would pass out when crossing one and would drive many miles to avoid them.  I was talking to a total stranger and mentioned my irrational fear of driving in winter and he suggested Paxil.  He was a rough neck hunter who developed a fear of climbing tree stands which made him unable to hunt.  I figured if it worked for him I should try it!  Thank goodness I did!  Game Changer!  I cross bridges and am amazed I ever feared them!"
