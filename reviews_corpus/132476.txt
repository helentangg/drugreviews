"Started off with 25mgs of Deptran to help with my sleep, anxiety and mild depression. I slowly increased to 50 and once I hit 75mgs I experienced serve sedation during the daytime. I found it hard to get out of bed, to function and ended up resting on my couch for up to 2 hours per day after getting out of bed! I heard it is good for some people who have trouble staying asleep but my problem was that exact opposite. I have trouble drifting into sleep.  Deptran(Doxepine) increased my anxiety/nervousness, gave me headaches, puffy eyes, tremors and made me too tired to function properly and it wasn&#039;t even helping me get to sleep! I was on this medication for 3 months so I gave it a decent try. Still weaning off this medication as I write this."
