"I have been on zoloft for OVER 20 years, and am in the medical field myself... As far as someone with extensive experience both as a patient and caregiver I can say this with absolute certainty....If when you first start Zoloft *Sertraline* you have some small side effects that is completely normal and to be expected as your body adjusts to this SSRI medication. its all about finding the right fit for you! You should start Low and slow and not be afraid to try to feel better! =) This medication can be a valuable asset to your life as it has been mine! and most common effects early on was feeling tired little dizzy and nauseous but it was worth those small things to feel better and live better!"
