"I have been on Brintellix for 8 months. It has been life changing for me. I feel it literally saved my life. I have been on more medicines than I can count over the past 15 yrs. I did have nausea pretty bad for the first couple weeks on Brintellix but taking the medicine at night with crackers and Sprite it was much better after about 2 weeks. Now here is the hopeless part... I have to go off the medicine due to severe side effects that I do not see others reporting. About 6 months into taking Brintellix (4 months on 10 mg and 5 months on 20 mg)I got severely sick with unexplainable internal bleeding and severe gastro problems.Thousands of dollars on medical testing and nothing found.2 days off better but mental disaster.terrible withdrawal"
