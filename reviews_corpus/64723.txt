"I&#039;ve struggled with social anxiety for almost 20 years and have tried Paxil, Celexa, counseling and therapy, with little to no results. I&#039;ve been on Zoloft for over 2 months now and it&#039;s changed my life!! It&#039;s a miracle drug-- I&#039;ve been lucky to have no side effects. If only I would&#039;ve had this 20 years ago. I usually blush easily and had a hard time talking to people but not with this! I feel like I can finally be myself."
