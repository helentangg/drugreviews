"I started taking Sarafem for my severe PMS about 2 months ago and am SHOCKED at how well it has worked for me!  I take it for about 7 days before my cycle - the same week that normally I would be paralyzed with anxiety and absurd thoughts due to my PMS.  The Sarafem worked the first day.  What is also odd is the rest of the month was even better, even though I wasn&#039;t taking anything.  The 15mg was a little too much for me -- I was WAY TOO HAPPY --- but splitting it in half is perfect."
