"Along with Celexa at 20mg, for about 5 weeks, I take 150mg of Wellbutrin, and 40 mg of methadone. I&#039;ve had several back surgeries so live with chronic pain.  Along with an improvement of depression and anxiety, I noticed that my appetite has decreased. No weight gain, maybe lost a couple pounds. I noticed improvement on the first couple days! I&#039;ve tried Prozac &amp; Welbutrin, individually &amp; together, but not much help.  I recommend giving Celexa a try over any other medicines."
