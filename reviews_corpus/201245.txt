"Been severely depressed for many years. Anxiety, ocd too. Zoloft has made me way more stable, down side is it can make you numb to life. I lost my dad in 06, I went into an awake coma so to speak, lost my mom last March, I felt the pain come in like bullet and then I felt overwhelmingly calm, that&#039;s the seratonin doing its job. I couldn&#039;t cry at the funeral or anything. While I&#039;m not depressed, I do feel many other effects, decreased libido, muscle twitch, I extend my legs and contort them in bed uncontrollably. I give it a 9 because it saved my life. I&#039;m on 150mg mornings. Have been for 10 years plus. Give it a good shot, let it have time to work. Good Luck. Don&#039;t ever give up."
