"Sertraline has helped with my mood swings and unwanted thoughts. I take 50 mg and can instantly feel if I miss my dosage. I would like to ween off but have too much going on that I don&#039;t think I can handle alone. Reasons I want to stop is memory loss, difficulty focusing, even struggle with people&#039;s names and I gain 20 lbs. For now the results outweigh the side effects but I&#039;m hopeful I can get to a better place soon so I can safely stop."
