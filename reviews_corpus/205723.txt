"I&#039;m 23 years old and I&#039;ve been suffering from on again off again moderate depression since I was about 18 years old. I am considering Pristiq and this is why. My father, a great guy who suffered through depression since he was about my age, has been on Pristiq for the past couple of years and I have to say, it&#039;s made HUGE improvements in his mood. He has shown no visible &quot;to me at least&quot; side effects. He used to be cranky, unhappy, and just overall openly expressed severe dislike for the world and the human race. Since he&#039;s been on Pristiq though he has done a complete 180 he no longer hates everything so much, and is very fun to be around, he is almost always in a good mood and enjoys spending time with his family."
