"This medication literally is a life saver. I&#039;ve had chronic migraines for 10 years. I was on 10mg for 6 months then my migraines came back. My doctor upped my dosage to 20 and now it&#039;s back to normal. But one side effect I can&#039;t seem to shake off is sleepiness. I&#039;m sleeping close to 16 hours+ a day."
