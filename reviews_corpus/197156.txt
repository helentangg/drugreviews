"I have been depressed with major social anxiety for over five years. I&#039;ve always been scared to try any medication. Lately it&#039;s been unbearable. I have too much social anxiety that I can&#039;t even sit through job interviews or simple things like going shopping alone. I&#039;m 25 and have been on Paxil for less than a month. The first two weeks were bad. I&#039;d wake up at odd hours of the night and be wide awake. I&#039;d feel like puking throughout the day along with being very drowsy. Don&#039;t worry. It does subside. I feel like going out more and I&#039;m not too worried as I usually am about people judging me or looking at me. I participate in small talk with strangers. I am free to go out without worrying. I&#039;m content."
