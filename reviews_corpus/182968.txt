"Positive experience! I have SAD, GAD, Social Anxiety and Depression. I have been taking 90 mg for 10 years now. I had tried Effexor, Paxil, Wellbutrin and Celexa. These had each worked for about a year and then didn&#039;t work anymore. I have one side effect that I deal with. I have hot flashes.  But this has been ok to deal with because my head finally felt right. I was able to go off of my anti-anxiety medication some years ago. After all this time on Cymbalta I have gone through some major life changes in the last year and my anxiety has come back. My depression has been sneaking back as well. I am trying CBT with a little success. I think I may need an increased dose or may have to try something new, which I dread."
