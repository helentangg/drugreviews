"Only the brand name version of Effexor works for me.  Luckily my medical insurance agreed with my doctor and authorized me to continue getting the brand name version.

I have found it to be very effective.  An Interesting &quot;good side effect&quot; is it helps with my serious face pain. A win win medicine."
