"After 13 years of untreated depression, anxiety and panic attacks I decided to finally ask for help.
That came in the form of 10mg Citalopram for the first week, 20mg for another month and boosted up to 30mg for the next few months. 
In that time I had nothing but bad side effects. Instead of feeling depressed and sad I just got grumpy and mad, I had trouble with my sex drive/performance and the insomnia was ridiculous. My partner told me I had changed since starting the medication. 
I have since come off all medication and living happily without."
