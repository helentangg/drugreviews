"I started this last night before I went to bed figured it would make me tired. I woke up at midnight with shakes/tremors. I fell back asleep a couple hours later,  but didn&#039;t really sleep. I mean I was asleep but its that sleep where you&#039;re really not sleeping because your mind won&#039;t stop running. Anyway so I called my doctor this morning and she told me just to take half a pill during the day now.  Today I have been crying non stop and have had to make several phone calls to my mom and husband because I am freaking out. I have two babies under the age of 2. I just want to be better for them.  Please looking for some advice or good words to help calm my thoughts."
