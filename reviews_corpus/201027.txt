"Zoloft actually changed my life. It&#039;s helped me cope with every day situations in an non reactive way. My thoughts have calmed down and my anxiety is minimal. I&#039;ve actually lost 15 lbs on Zoloft. I started on 50mg and now I&#039;m up to 200mg per day. I&#039;ve been on it for about a year now and I like that it doesn&#039;t numb everything or make me super emotional or tired. I&#039;m very well balanced. I just wish I could sleep better."
