"I have been citalopram for over a year from a recent breakdown. I have been on in the past for PND and it works for me. I have dropped my dose to 5mg every second to third day, but with Christmas coming up I increased my dose to 5mg a day, but I forgot about the side effects as my anixety is 100% I know it will pass but it&#039;s hard to keep the self talk going."
