"Break down last October. Caused by the constant trials of being a carer of 16 yrs, spinal surgery &amp; almost overnight profound hearing loss.  Had had enough!
Sertraline 100mg has made me brighter, happier, more positive, no longer as anxious about the future.  For me it has worked wonders &amp; am told I will require it for long term.
Side effects which I believe are associated with sertraline. Most nights I&#039;m asleep at 8pm.
Can no longer relax &amp; watch TV at night.
Have huge long assorted crazy dreams every night."
