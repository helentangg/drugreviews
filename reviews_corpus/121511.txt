"After a suicide attempt that landed me in the hospital&#039;s psych ward for three weeks, I was put on Effexor XR and Lamotrigine as a mood stabilizer. This combo has changed my life. It took a few months to get the dosage right (yes, MONTHS), but I&#039;m coming up on two years since I&#039;ve been hospitalized with little to no problems. I&#039;m 21 and finishing my post-secondary education, hold a part-time job, live on my own, and have loving and supporting relationships. I never thought it would get better until Effexor came around."
