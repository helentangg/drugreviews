"I&#039;ve had migraines since I was 21 (I am now 69).  Absolutely horrible and debilitating migraines sometimes lasting several days.  My neurologist started me on Elavil recently.  I still have head pain but it&#039;s not as severe as it has been.  It is bearable now.  My life is beginning to be something to look forward to; I am even going to visit one of my sons in Arizona, something that I haven&#039;t done for a number of years."
