"I&#039;m new to having uncontrolled anxiety [from an auto accident] and taking an SSRI.  I spent 3 weeks trying natural/alternative methods but couldn&#039;t get the anxiety under control.  Went to a GP and who let me start at 10mg [20mg side effects were too much] and stayed there.  I noticed a huge improvement after the 1st week and felt normal [with blips of uncontrolled anxiety] up until the 6th week when the general anxiety became heightened.  I  increased my dose to 15mg for a week [no side effects] and then increase to 20mg and hope that dose works for me.  Stick with the drug as it does work!"
