"Just increased from 20mg to 40mg 4 days ago. Can&#039;t tell if I&#039;m feeling any better. Also on Zyprexa for treatment resistant depression and Ativan which appears to have stabilized my anxiety. Will continue talking Prozac and give it the full 8 weeks before making any changes. So far it&#039;s the Ativan that seems to be working the best for me. Been dealing with this illness for over 15 years and have been on it seems like most of the medications available."
