"I have been taking Sertraline for the last 12 weeks (5 weeks at 25 MG and 7 weeks at 50MG).  I have given Sertraline 10 out of 10 because since week 7 I was feeling perfect - back to my old self.  however over the last couple of days I have felt my anxiety creeping back in and had my first adrenaline surge in 6 weeks during the night last night.  I am now terrified my anxiety is returning like it was before and don&#039;t know what to do.  Has anyone else experienced a &quot;blip&quot; at this stage and how long did it last?  I don&#039;t really want to increase my dose but don&#039;t want to return to the way things were.  I was feeling so happy and back to my old self for 4 weeks and now am feeling so disappointed.  Can anyone give me some positive advice please?"
