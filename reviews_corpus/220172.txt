"I started at 10 mg on this, but quickly went to 25 mg, as the pain was too much. Now I&acute;ve levelled it to 20 mg per day, in the evening, and it has been wonderful, This, along with a careful diet, have helped and almost put in remission my IC symptoms. Side effects for me include grogginess, but that&acute;s wearing away the more I take it and, for sure, a huge spike in my apetite, which I&acute;ve had to be careful about as I don&acute;t want to gain weight on it. It&acute;s not a miracle drug, but it worked for me, and I think anyone suffering from this condition should give it a try."
