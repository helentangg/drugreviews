"I was on this medication for years for OCD anxiety depression PTSD , then wanted to get pregnant and switched to Zoloft. The Z stopped working after a year and terrible panic attacks started happening again. Went back on P. 

Overall, I am happy to not be crying all the time and not snapping at my family. I have a much better time on P than on Z. 

My only problem is the weight gain that comes with it. It&#039;s very sad for me to gain 20 pounds. 

But still, it&#039;s better than being so scared all the time. 

Please, make sure you take as directed. It takes six weeks for medicine like this to work. You won&#039;t know after a day or two. 

Stay strong"
