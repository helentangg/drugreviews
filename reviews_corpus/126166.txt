"Have been on this almost 2 weeks. It&#039;s still early and I think my body is still adjusting a little bit, but I feel much, much better. It&#039;s like I can&#039;t even remember what I was so anxious and depressed about. I have more energy, I&#039;m not fixating on negative things and my body aches and pains are gone. I have some injuries that have been lingering for a long time, and I just woke up the other day and the knots and soreness was gone. It&#039;s like my whole body has learned to relax over night. I&#039;ve lost some weight and my appetite has been a bit suppressed, though I think that&#039;s something that will go away with time.  Also randomly I feel at times like I am having an adrenaline rush for no reason, but its a small prices to pay for the pay off."
