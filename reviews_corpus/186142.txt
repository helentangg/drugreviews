"This medication has been a lifesaver!  I have been on it for almost 3 weeks and I am amazed at how much better I feel.  I suffered a breakdown just after Thanksgiving and continued to be an utter disaster for a few weeks...I entered a PHP program where the Psych suggested Pristiq, something I had been asking my Primary Psych for months!  After about 4-5 days, I began to feel somewhat whole again and I&#039;m getting better each day.  I still have my ups and downs but I&#039;m now able to get out of bed and shower everyday!  The only reason I did not give a 10 is because of some undesirable side effects such as, nausea and very dry mouth.  I am told that by 4-6 weeks this should go away."
