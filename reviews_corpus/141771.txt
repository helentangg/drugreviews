"I have suffered from anxiety my whole life but it never got to the point where I felt like it was ruining parts of my life. Then both of my parents got sick and out of nowhere I could barely eat, go out and everyday felt like a battle. I was prescribed Lexapro and at first I was so anxious to take the medicine that the first week of taking it really spiked my anxiety. After about 10-14 days I felt amazing! I could eat again without feeling like I was choking on everything and I felt like my old self again. Actually like a better version of my old self. I would strongly recommend this medicine to anyone suffering from anxiety. Just know that it takes a little while for it to work and the first week can be terrible. Just stick with it!"
