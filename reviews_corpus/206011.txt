"This medication was prescribed to me for appetite suppression. I have been on it for 6 days now and have had no real side effects. I feel I may have had some depression issues I was not completely aware of, as I feel a bit more positive and in better spirits.  I think it&#039;s too soon to tell overall how well this medication works.  As of now, I have not experienced appetite suppression."
