"MAOIs surpass all other groups of contemporary antidepressants in my biased opinion. Unlike other medications , parnate enriched me with clarity and motivation, and just simply made me feel better. You adjust to the effects over time but it still makes me functional where I was once disabled. I owe this venerable chemical my gratitude, despite the one horrific yet transient reaction I&#039;ve encountered on it."
