"I think Effexor has been very beneficial for me - I&#039;ve taken it for about six years.  A word of warning: Do NOT let your prescription run out or take yourself off Effexor abruptly!  I experienced this by accident while waiting for a mail-order prescription to arrive (my doctor was just moving into a new office and didn&#039;t have samples available).  Within 2 days, I was a wreck emotionally (depressive, sobbing for no reason), cognitively (all over the place, no concentration), and physically (impaired motor coordination among other things). The &quot;brain shivers&quot; a feeling like an electrical current running from the brain down the spine and back again, are very disconcerting! I got samples from my doctor&#039;s former office and was noticeably better within hours of 1 dose."
