"Chronic back pain for two years. I have a herniated disc touching a nerve and a ripped disc. Though my pain isn&#039;t severe over time it builds up to what feels like an endless spiral of pain. A few of these later and the pain goes and I feel like a normal human being again. I take for a few months and then I&#039;m okay until I find that next uncomfortable twist. Then back on them for a short while. They have given me my life back."
