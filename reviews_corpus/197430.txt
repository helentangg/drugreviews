"1st week: Paxil worked for my depression and anxiety instantly which is out of the norm. I was nauseous all the time and experienced yawning quite frequently, this went away as time went on. Paxil had an almost euphoric feel for me, I was laughing at everything and enjoying life.

1st month: Yawning still exists, euphoria has worn off as well as any anti-depressant effect. However still for works for anxiety.

3rd month and beyond: Outside of excessive sleeping and somewhat fatigue feeling Paxil is awesome for anxiety, but the antidepressant effect wore off rather quickly for me.

Recommend for anxiety, not recommended for depression. "
