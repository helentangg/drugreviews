"I have had clinical depression since I was a young child. I am now almost 24 and I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever been happy, for more than a few weeks at a time, in my entire life. I have been on Zoloft and Wellbutrin in the past that did not help at all. I have been on Brintellix for a little over 6 months now and it has changed my life. I&#039;m a better wife, mother and a significantly better college student. For the first time in my life I feel alive. There are no longitudinal studies on this new drug which makes me nervous. Side effects were severe for about 3 weeks and my insurance doesn&#039;t cover this very expensive drug(why I rated 9/10). Ultimately, Brintellix changed my life. I didn&#039;t think I would ever be happy."
