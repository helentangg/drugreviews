"I started taking Pristiq about 5 weeks ago.  I was experiencing some nausea at first, but after about two weeks it faded.  About three weeks in I forgot to take the medicine for three days and completely plummetted into a dangerous pool of emotion.  I have been on one other medication, Celexa, and what I like what Pristiq is that I am still able to experience a wide range of emotions. When I was on Celexa I was a little bit numb to things and wasn&#039;t able to cry, at all.  With Prisiq I am more focused and I am happier."
