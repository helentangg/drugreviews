"I have back pain due to an injury at work. I also have endometriosis and massive scar tissue from my 2 abdominal surgeries. I was having problems well over a year and when my husband decided to walk out my back started hurting more. My Doctor told me that depression can worsen pain. He gave me the Cymbalta 30mg and after one week I&#039;m supposed to up it to 60 mg a day. I am on my 4th day taking it. The first day I had the jitters and my heart beat was higher than normal. I also had almost no sleep that night. So I checked out reviews and found that you shouldn&#039;t have caffeine with this prescription. Least to say 4th day no side effects but no coffee either so I&#039;m feeling pretty tired. Less pain but I&#039;m still sore and have tight muscles."
