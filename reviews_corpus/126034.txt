"Giving it a 10 after only 3 days might sound odd but comparing to other meds I have been on, it&#039;s a 10.  I was on Lexapro 20mg and Wellbutrin for a year and a half.  Stopped the meds cold turkey for a year.  (Not a smart move). I had no feelings at all and I looked physically off. I had the distance look in my eyes all the time.  Plus I gained 40lbs over the course of this 2 1/2 years. So I finally go to a new doctor and explain my feelings and he says I have SMD and anxiety.  He mentioned this Viibryd.  Day 1 I had that upset stomach feeling at night had a hard time sleeping, same thing with Day 2, Today is day 3 and I feel awesome, slept well and woke before my alarm.  I love this. Can&#039;t wait to see what the future holds."
