"Been taking Lexapro 10mg for 4 weeks now. It started to help a little after just 2 days. Now I have very few guilt feelings, nearly no depression, no suicidal thoughts, no obsessing over negative things. Not too much help with social anxiety, but does help anxiety around angry people.  Unfortunately, during PMS, it barely helps me, but once that is passed, I&#039;m okay again. Makes sleep WONDERFUL and easy.
Side effects-sleepy off and on during the day, mild, treatable, headaches the first few days."
