"I&#039;ve taken sertraline for almost 3 months now, and it&#039;s been a very positive thing to my life. I feel much less anxious and I feel more confident. I do have to say that my sleep has not improved, in fact might be worse...and I never thought in a million years that I&#039;d be ok with worse sleep. The reason I say this is that I&#039;m not someone who&#039;s dealt well with lack of sleep in the past. I was not able to function on even 6 hours of sleep if the sleep was poor and I got up many times. I&#039;d be bed ridden, or really have to push myself, on days when my sleep was poor. Now it&#039;s pretty clear that the amount of fatigue I felt was 100% related to being even more anxious on days that I slept poorly. Now, despite poor sleep, I feel much better."
