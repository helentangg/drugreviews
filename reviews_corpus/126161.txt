"This medicine upset the last two months of my life. I kept telling my doctor is was not working, He told me to keep trying it. I continuously had diarrhea for two months sometimes having accidents. Sometimes my stools were bloody in nature and I went to see my regular doctor to see if something else was wrong with me and found out it was a side effect of Viibryd. I was extremely irritated at the time of day I would take my dose and a side effect is anger, I lost great friendship with family and friends because I became angry. I am depressed and usually very mellow. For the first time in my life, I was suicidal while on this medicine. Going off the medicine, the withdrawals led to an itchiness of my skin of my entire body. No more Viibryd!"
