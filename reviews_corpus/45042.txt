"As Lanie, the poster below me stated, Prozac also seemed to only make me worse.  I&#039;m sure it has genuinely worked for many people, otherwise it wouldn&#039;t have such a high average rating, but I know for a fact it only contributed to my symptoms (paranoia, impulses, unwanted thoughts) rather than relieved them. I cut it cold turkey back in college and suffered a few more years without meds before finding some relief with Celexa, but Prozac was definitely not a pleasant experience for me."
