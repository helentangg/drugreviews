"Withoug Zoloft I would probably be dead or killed.  I have been taking Zoloft for 19 years.  Since my daughter was born the doctors have tried to take me off, but the depression started again.  I did counseling and reduced the dose, but to be completely off makes me mean.  I snap at people, easily irritated, road rage, body feels like it will explode with anxiety.  It has never effected my sex drive.  No weight gain can be blamed on Zoloft, probably feeling more sociable and going out to eat has caused a little weight gain. No headaches. Thanks for reading and I hope I helped.  "
