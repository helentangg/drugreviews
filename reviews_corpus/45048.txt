"This medication made me yawn frequently. After two months, I didn&#039;t notice any improvement in my mood but my jaw was killing me from yawning and clenching my teeth which I don&#039;t normally do. My friends and family also pointed out that I seemed more irritable and more likely to snap or be short tempered."
