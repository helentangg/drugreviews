"I suffered from severe depression with constant daily suicidal ideation and anxiety. I was really falling apart and was at the end of my rope. I was given 10mg of  esciltalopram, my Dr told me to take it at 5mg for 4 days first which helped greatly. I suffered from very light side effects. First three nights I had trouble sleeping so some melatonin fixed that for me. Other than that I am totally fine. Six days in on the medication I have absolutely no suicidal ideation and my mood is totally changed. It feels like I did a total 180. I understand that every medication is different for everyone but this has been amazing for me."
