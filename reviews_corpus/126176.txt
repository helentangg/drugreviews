"I have been on Viibryd for 3 weeks now and I feel awesome. I had the bathroom issues just for one day and then it stopped. It happened again when I increased to 20mg but I feel great. I noticed after the 3rd day that my depression was gone. I feel really upbeat and my husband has really noticed a big difference. I have been on a lot of other antidepressants and by far this is the best one. I am also on Latuda which seems to be working well also. I give this medicine a 10 because it has really helped me."
