"I went to my Doctor with main concern being sex drive. He suggested I&#039;m probably very stressed. And I was, I have two small children. Welbutrin helped my sex drive, I quit stress smoking, and it suppressed my appetite. I just felt really unstable, and was lashing out. I took it for a couple of months then asked to change. I was given Viibryd. I was given 10mg the first week, 20 the second week, 40 the third. Everything was great until I started taking the 40mg. I took it for two days. During those two days I started having panic attacks that I had never experienced before. I thought I was losing my mind! I went back down to 20mg and things got back to normal and I love it! I did experience diarrhea for a while, I&#039;m not sure if it was related."
