"I am on this medication since February 2016.
At that time I was literally hopeless, unable to sleep, eat, work and live.I barely could get out of bed for a shower.I was diagnosed with severe depression. I started sertraline. Things slowly improved ,in 3-4 weeks I could eat and sleep again. The medicine reached its full potential in about 3 months, and since then no sign of depression, I am a much more balanced, happy person right now."
