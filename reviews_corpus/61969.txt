"So I started taking about a week ago, because I have severe anxiety and ADHD as well as OCD, and at first it was miserable, I couldn&#039;t read or think straight, it felt like I was in a dream I was in a daze and I was so light headed, i had a terrible dry mouth with the most awful headache, and I felt sleepy, and sluggish, even passed out while getting dressed. I did have better concentration, and overall felt calmer but it has seriously drained me out of alot of other emotions.  A week later I am still tired, but I&#039;m not falling asleep during everyday tasks. I can think straight, though I still get light headed and dry mouth, I feel calmer and more relaxed though, and I can focus. My emotions are here and there though, not really constant."
