"I have been taking Pristiq for 2 months now and I love it. I had a breakdown in my Doctors office. I hadn&#039;t been sleeping well and was really depressed. He said you need something to help you now. Within 2 days all the waterworks had stopped and I felt better. I take 50mg first thing with my breakfast. Never had any side effects at all. Went back after 2 weeks and told him I was feeling better but still not sleeping well. He gave me Xanax for anxiety small dose 0.25mg before bed and now I sleep great. I wake up feeling a little tired but do a few stretching exercises and eat a good breakfast that gives me energy for the day. I feel better than I have in 2 years. God Bless You All."
