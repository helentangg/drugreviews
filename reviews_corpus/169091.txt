"I was prescribed Viibryd for Major Depressive Disorder. Felt a little better after 2 weeks on the 30 day sample pack, but when I got up to 40 mg after 2 pills I started experiencing drug induced psychosis (heard a man&#039;s voice whispering one morning while I was alone, which I never had before), and also felt no emotions and felt floaty like nothing mattered. Then my doctor dropped me back down to 20 mg, generally I have been great around other people, but only recently in the past few weeks have I started feeling a heaviness in my chest like I feel like crying, and a constant feeling of being fat even though I exercise and eat regularly and only weigh around 135-139pds. I&#039;m not sure if the medication is working for me anymore."
