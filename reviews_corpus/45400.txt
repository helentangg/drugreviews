"Can&#039;t stop laughing when taking this. This medicine makes me very giddy and I guess in a huge way that keeps me from breaking down and crying. I would not recommend taking this if you&#039;re working. I can&#039;t do any serious work when I&#039;m taking this medication. I&#039;m in the mood to put on some pj&#039;s and watch Spongebob."
