"I was on Zoloft for Depression, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Panic Disorder. Initially, Zoloft helped me a lot and I didn&#039;t have any kind of panic attacks, a constant sense of mild anxiety, or depression all that bad. However, after about a year of being on it it started to make me feel like a complete zombie. I had zero motivation for anything which reflected in my grades and I&#039;m normally an obsessive overachiever in school.. I just kind of let myself go. I wasn&#039;t depressed but I wasn&#039;t happy, it just put me in this fog-like feeling. The withdraw for me felt like I might as well have been coming off heroin. I couldn&#039;t eat or sleep, I had cold sweats, nausea/vomiting, and I had anxiety like never before. It was truly a nightmare."
