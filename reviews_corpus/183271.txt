"I have been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder.  My doctor prescribed Cymbalta.  It cured my anxiety, but came at a price... it&#039;s an expensive medicine, and I hope that mediation and relaxation will help me get off of Cymbalta one day :) Short term, it has been extremely effective in my recovery of anxiety and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder."
