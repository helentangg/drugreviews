"My anxiety caused me to have to move back in with my parents after 20 years, my guts were always churning, everything I ate would go straight through me and I would get panic attacks that made me sweat; I had to be signed off from work. The anxiety lead to depression and I honestly didn&#039;t know how I was going to get through each day. Citalopram has fixed me completely. The first week or so was rough and the symptoms worsened but I was warned about that and stuck with it. Now I lead a normal life, I work, travel the world and function well in relationships. I am deeply grateful for the drug. Sometimes I feel bad about being dependent on it - I can&#039;t seem to come off without the symptoms returning, but I couldn&#039;t have carried on how I was."
