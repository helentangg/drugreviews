"I had been on Prystiq for about 8 months, but I thought my mood swings, irritability, paranoid thoughts, anxiousness, etc, were a thing of the past.  Also, Prystiq is an expensive drug that is not covered by my pharmacy coverage.  So, I quit cold turkey.  Brain zaps, zombie mode, feeling horrible were all part of what I endured, but the symptoms quickly subsided.  What came back a month after stopping Prystiq was the little dark cloud and all over the other things that I thought were in my past.  I was having difficult coping. 
 Now, I am on day two of effexor (which costs pennies on the dollar as compared to Prystiq).  The nausea is intense but I know that if I stick with it the results will be all for the best."
