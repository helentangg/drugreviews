"Started this med with serious apprehension due to bad side effects of other SSRI drugs, but WOW!  What a difference.  It takes nearly two months for things to balance out but I feel like my self again.  Euthymic (normal non-depressed, reasonably positive mood) with in a normal range and anxiety at a normal level.  I have done two job interviews and started a new job with no panic attacks.  Please remember that medication is only one part of recovery.  I have practice mindfulness daily as well as see a counsellor to tackle the route of my problems but this medication has allowed me to function again..........happy"
