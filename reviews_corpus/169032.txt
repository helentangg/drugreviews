"At first, between the spontaneous nausea, diarrhea, and brain zaps, I thought I couldn&#039;t handle it.  I have been on every SSRI known to science including Cymbalta.  The side effects of Viibryd were so bad when I went to 20mg so I ask my Doctor if we could just go back to the 10mg for a couple more weeks.  2 days after that decision, things really cleared up.  The nausea softened and Imodium AD took care of the Diarrhea.  Suddenly, I felt so much better and my libido came roaring back.  I haven&#039;t felt this good in many many years.  But, I had to go through hell to get to this point. This is not your usual medication. It takes perseverance, dedication and a lot of patience. Plan to spend 2, 3 or 4 months to adapt- but it&#039;s worth it."
