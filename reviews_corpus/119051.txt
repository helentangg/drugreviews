"I have been on Zoloft for 18 months now and I LOVE it.  I first went on it for some postpartum depression paired with several other major situations that were going on in my life.  After the first few days I felt like I could deal with my life, like this was something I always should have been on.  I have always dealt with bouts of depression and anxiety but was never put on any medication but I should have been. I will continue this Zoloft as long as my doctor will allow."
