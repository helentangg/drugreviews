"I woke up one day with a horrible migraine that never went away.  Every day, all day. It was killing me. I haven&#039;t ever had a headache like this. Definitely never had one that lasted the entire day. So after four doctor visits, three blood test and six months of non-stop migraines, I was prescribed Nortriptyline. Only after two weeks I was waking up with out a headache. By the time I had got up to 40 milligrams, I was headache free. I&#039;m so happy and relieved. The only side effects I am experiencing are dry mouth and trouble with sleepiness in the morning."
