"I have experienced depression and anxiety for the last five years and was prescribed Luvox. However I was still getting a lot of mood swings, was very low and anxious - struggling to hold down my job due to sleep deprivation.  After three months on this medicine I only wish I had moved over sooner.  I have never felt the urge to write a review like this before but felt the desire due to the significant change it has brought to my life and that for my wife and kids.  No weight gain for me although I did have headaches for a few days but they passed within a week.  Highly recommended."
