"I am 38 yr female.. Woke up one morning anxious and worried (about 1.5 yr ago).. Thought i was just having a stressful week but it became endless.. I remain in the constant state of &quot;being on the edge&quot;.. I can&#039;t focus on my children&#039;s conversations because my mind is in a million places, im always accusing and assuming my husband is lying or leading another life, I can&#039;t reember what it felt like to be excited about doing anything.. As much as I don&#039;t want to worry and speculate, it is all I allow myself to do.. I am able to put on a front at work, people think i am happy go lucky, but inside I am a train wreck! I&#039;m on my third week in with lex, and so far have only added irritated to the mix.. I&#039;m sticking it out tho, thanks to the reviews"
