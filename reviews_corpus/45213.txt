"This medication coupled with cognitive behavioural therapy has helped me so much in dealing with my social anxiety/panic disorder which I have had to deal with for over 10 years. By lifting my mood and clearing my head this medication had allowed me to think more clearly and rationally about what it is I&#039;m panicking about, then using my cognative behavioural therapy techniques I am them able to calm myself down and talk myself out of that horrible feeling (hyperventilating/pounding heart/light headedness). I had previously used propanolol to calm me down when I felt stressed but as this is no longer working I had to try something else. I was put on 20mg, 1st two weeks I had a bit of sickness, trouble sleeping but  that passed."
