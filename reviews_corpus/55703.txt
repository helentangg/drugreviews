"if you want to try this drug, make sure you&#039;re prepared to either stay on it forever or be able to take at least 1 month off from your life to try to get this out of your system. I&#039;ve been on other psychiatric drugs and I&#039;m all for them. They really help get you through rough episodes, therefore I&#039;m not a scathing anti drug, crunchy all natural person. However, I can say this is one nasty, nasty drug. I feel like I&#039;ve been dumping poison in my system for the last 2 years. 3 weeks tapering VERY slowly and the room still spins, I can&#039;t move my eyes without intense brain zaps, and basically feel like a raging lunatic. If you&#039;ve tried many other drugs and they haven&#039;t worked and this is a last resort then I say go for it, but with caution."
