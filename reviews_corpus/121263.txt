"This was the worst of all the antidepressants I&#039;ve been on. One day without taking it and I would immediately start to withdrawal. I quit this cold turkey disregarding my doctor&#039;s request because I just wanted it out of my system. I basically went manic for about a week but I felt so much better when it was cleared from my system. Hated this drug. 0 stars if I could. My new doctor even refuses to prescribe this."
