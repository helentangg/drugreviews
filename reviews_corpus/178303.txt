"Stopped taking Cymbalta after being on the medicine for almost year.  Worked wonders for the pain from Fibro and also improved my mood.  I also had some horrible side effects.  Lost a ton of hair, gained 40 pounds and became a compulsive gambler. Heard of others suffering from compulsive behavior on the medicine and also euphoria feelings.  I couldn&#039;t get over my loss of control when it came to gambling (slots).  I know others on the drug who became shopaholics.  I have been off the drug for five weeks and what a difference.  My hair is growing in better and is not falling out like before.  I have no desire to go gamble.  Losing the weight may be more difficult.  I am glad I have decided to get off the medicine, but am also suffering fibro pain."
