"I started Cymbalta for major depression and suicidal ideation (no plan).  It worked.  Took as much as 90mg at my high point.  I&quot;m now tapering down to 30 mg.  Going from 3 pills a day to 1 pill a week is hard but manageable.  But the side effects for this drug are real.  Dizziness, blurry vision, constipation to runs.  I would say for me, I could work through them because I wanted to live.  The tapering has started aura migraines which are close to unbearable but I get through it.  I say close because I almost felt like going to the ER once.  I&#039;ve slept 2 days straight trying to overcome an aura migraine.  No light, sound, food, or blankets.  If you were in my place over a year ago, taking Cymbalta would have been a no brainer."
