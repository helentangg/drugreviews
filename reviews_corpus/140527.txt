"Have been on escitalaporan for just on 4 weeks . 
The first week was a little tough and the doctor gave me diazepam to help . 
After week the first week I was still  not settled but was able to stop diazepam ! 
Had headaches for the first 3 and a half weeks , Panadol helped . 
So have just reached the 4 week mark and feel I&#039;ve turned the corner !! 
Diet is very important . No alcohol , caffeine . 
Lots of water , bananas , sushi and yogurt . 
Started seeing a therapist and am learning about breathing and finding out ways that might help in the future . 
Starting a yoga course and feeling much happier about myself ."
