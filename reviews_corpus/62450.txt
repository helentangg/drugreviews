"I&#039;ve always been a worrier, since I was a child. I assumed it was normal because it was all I&#039;d ever known. After a bad break up and alot of professional stress I decided to see my doctor for a &quot;crutch&quot; to get me through the worst of it and was fully intending for the medication to be a short term situation. I&#039;ve always been against taking medication for my stress. However, in the two months I&#039;ve been on Celexa I&#039;ve decided I&#039;d be more than happy to stay on it forever, as long as it keeps working. The obsessive worrying is just gone, poof! I can worry about something for a few minutes and then move on with my life. I&#039;m happy and vibrant and I feel completely normal now. I had side effects - Yawning, sleeplessness only for the first 2 weeks"
