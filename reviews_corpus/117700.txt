"I have been on this medication now for 6 months for nerve pain and tingling down my leg from a trapped nerve in my back. 10 mg at night along with other Paracetamol and Ibuprofen certainly does relieve the pain. I was told to increase the Nortriptyline as required to 20 mg at night if necessary but so far I have not had to do that. Side effects have been virtually non existent against the benefit of it."
