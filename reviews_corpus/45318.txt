"I thought it was just me.  Me not being strong enough to just &quot;deal with it&quot;. No one understood me.  I would obsess over my health, death, relationships to a point where I thought I was going crazy.  I couldn&#039;t stop freaking out.  Then I had my first anxiety attack.  My heart was racing and I felt like I was going to die.  No one knows that feeling unless you&#039;re like me ... anxiety/panic attack.  I had no idea what it was and I rushed over to my parents (NOT RECOMMENDED).  I remembered nothing.  I woke up the next day feeling drained. A week went by and it happened again.  I decided I needed help.  Prozac was discussed as a long term treatment and I&#039;ve gained my life back.  I&#039;m happy.  Which I haven&#039;t been in such a long time.  Just happy."
