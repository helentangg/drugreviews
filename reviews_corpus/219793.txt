"I was given 10mg Amitriptyline for insomnia, anxiety and migraines.  It didn&#039;t seem to help the insomnia much, even with taking .25mg - .5mg Klonopin.   So the doctor gave me 25mg Amitriptyline which I just couldn&#039;t tolerate.  Gave me worse insomnia, nightmares, even some bruises and muscle spasms in my back, which I&#039;m assuming is related to the medication.   I&#039;m going to go back down to the 10mg and see what happens.  I&#039;m so sad because I&#039;ve been reading all of these great reviews, and was really hoping it would help.  I&#039;m underweight, and just very sensitive to most medicines.  So I would say give it a try, since it works differently for everyone.  I will update soon."
