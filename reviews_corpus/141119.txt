"Had been struggling with GAD, OCD and Depression for years, trying numerous drugs on the Australian market, and nothing would work. Side effects from most were enough to make me stop, as they were horrible, and did nothing to help the anxiety. 

Ive been on Loxalate 10mg for 8 weeks now, and woah. I had little to no side effects at all, and the over obsessing thoughts and feelings started to fade away almost instantly.

I feel as though for the first time my thoughts are my own and not my anxieties or fears."
