"I&#039;ve tried numerous anti depressants with varying degrees of success and failures. I transitioned to Viibryd from Trentellix. I started out on 10mgs per day and titrated up to 40 mgs. Within the first week my mood and demeanor became more positive. I stopped thinking about suicide. I did experience some side effects such as vivid nightmares and the inability to sleep. Major trouble sleeping at anytime. I told my doctor and she added Zyprexa 10mgs at night. Finally I could sleep. I&#039;m going to see if she&#039;ll increase it a little more. This combination works wonders for me. If Viibryd alone isn&#039;t working for you try adding an anti psychotic or mood stabilizer. I feel really good on both of these medications. Finally, something worked."
