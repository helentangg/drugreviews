"So basically since I was around 20 (I&#039;m 36 now) I&#039;ve suffered from general anxiety and horrible panic attacks, really bad hypochondria. I&#039;ve gone to the hospital thinking I was dying of everything. I graduated from an Ivy League college and suffered the entire time. Finally I decided to bite the billet and try lexapro (brand name not generic). I started at 10mg and had a week of terrible side effects including: depression, couldn&#039;t cry, weird feelings hard to describe, insomnia, increased anxiety, fatigue, all around shaky feeling. I couldn&#039;t deal with it so I started to cut the pills in half to 5 mg- side effects went away except I have increased libido (it gets annoying). No panic attacks. Still have anxiety a little tiny bit."
