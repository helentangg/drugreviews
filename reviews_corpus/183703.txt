"Started with 30mg plus Ativan (lorazepam) 1-2mg/day for anxiety/depression.  OK.  Then, up to 45.  Too strong, down to 30.  Later back to 45, then 60.  Lots and lots of side effects--ear pain, weird nerve pains, mania, then urinary retention which is VERY serious. Kept trying it too long, 7 weeks.  Then switched to Venlafaxine ER which is much more tolerable."
