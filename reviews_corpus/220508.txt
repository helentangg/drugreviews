"I have been on Amitriptyline HCL 25 mg at bedtime for less than one week and wake up groggy for about 20 minutes. I fall asleep but will wake up at least twice during the night but I will fall back to sleep. And talk about the vivid and wild dreams which I have never experienced before! I think I am very sensitive to this type of medicine."
