"I&#039;ve been taking this pill since grade 10 (so I&#039;ve been on the medication for 4 yrs now) and I haven&#039;t experienced any bad side effects. But in my opinion, it didn&#039;t fully help me recover. Even over a year I&#039;ve taken it, I would still get thoughts of suicide or hurting myself, either if it&#039;s physically or emotionally. But since last summer when I&#039;ve told my youth worker about what&#039;s been going over in my life and she suggested I go to my psychologist and see if he&#039;ll up my dose or use a different medication or using therapy. I&#039;ve went from 20 to 30 mg and I&#039;ve been doing a lot better in my college tests and exams."
