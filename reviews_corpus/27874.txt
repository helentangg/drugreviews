"Lexapro made me very tired all the time. I NEEDED a daily midday nap. I&#039;m a college student so I was able to sleep at odd periods of the day, but it was ridiculous. I could get a solid 10 hours of sleep at night but by 1 pm I&#039;d be dead tired. One time I was late picking up a kid I used to babysit from her elementary school because I fell asleep and slept through my alarm in the middle of the afternoon!! I was never the type who could take naps until I started Lexapro. I didn&#039;t stay on it for more than 6 months because being THAT tired all the time was ruining my social life, grades, work life, the list goes on."
