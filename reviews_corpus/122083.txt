"I have been on 450mg of Effexor for over a year now and while it is better with the medicine it hasn&#039;t had the full effect I was hoping for. As a result I have also been prescribed Seroquel, olanzapine and diazapam. I am fearing coming off any of these medications especially at such high doses and was wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences."
