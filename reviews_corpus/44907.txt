"I just feel the need to express how well I&#039;ve been feeling with this change. Started a month ago with 20 mg. This week I upped the dose to 40 mg, my OCD comes and goes, it just doesn&#039;t bother me anymore, feeling free of those useless ruminations. Let me honestly tell you, sertraline was good, then but this medicine is just great, feeling better results and gives me sort of more activating feeling and motivation. I&#039;ll stick with it for a while with this dose. There is hope for OCD, please don&#039;t give up, there are lot options out there, God bless all of you."
