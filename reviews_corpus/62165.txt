"I have had panic disorder for about 2 years now. I&#039;ve been taking this medicine for a year of this. I had four ambulances rang to my house constantly thought I was going to die. This medicine has helped me a lot but my illness is very strong and still have severe panic attacks from time to time followed by migraines. It is very effective, it wont kick in for a month or so, so just hang in there things get worse before they improve. I take a 20mg dose by the way."
