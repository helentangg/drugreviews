"I have been depressed for a very long time. Always try so many different kind of medicines but Pristiq seems to be working great. I have already lost 12lbs in 3 weeks and I feel a lot better, with my mood swings being better. My kids have noticed a big difference in me. The only side effect was stomach was hurting but it went away. The only thing is that I feel a little down but I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s because of my PMS. I go to the doctor tomorrow and we&#039;ll see what he says but other then that I have more motivation then I ever did before. I always give up on other pills but this one seems to work. I could enjoy my life again. I just hope if they increase the dose to 100 that I will feel better and I won&#039;t be disappointed. "
