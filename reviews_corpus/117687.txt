"I am 27 years old and have suffered with migraine headaches since I can remember. I have taken many pills to help relieve my pain and for the past 3 years I have been on Maxalt (which works great) but I was still getting migraines that I would end up being in bed for a couple of days (not as often as past medicines). Now my doctor has given me nortiptyline as a prevention med and I am on my 2nd month on it and I have only had 3 migraine episodes since then, which is great!"
