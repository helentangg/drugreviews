"I was put on Lexapro by my family doctor in May after experiencing chest pain and elevated blood pressure. Test were done to make sure I wasn&#039;t experiencing a heart attack before my doctor determined that stress was my issue.  For the first several weeks I had increased anxiety, loss of appetite and vivid dreams.  I was quite sure this medicine wasn&#039;t for me.  My doctor encouraged me to keep taking it and prescribed Ativan to help me get through some rough days.  After being on Lexapro for 8 months now, I can honestly say I feel better than I have for years! I had no idea how much anxiety I had until it went away.  I&#039;m so thankful for this medicine and for my doctor who encouraged me to try it."
