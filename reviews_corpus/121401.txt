"I was started on 150mg per day and since the 1st day I started I felt an instant relief. I have severe anxiety, depression, irritability, bipolar 2 . I feel so much happier ,a totally different person and so positive and focused. Only side effect is some nausea and insomnia but I find taking my meds early in the morning helps me to be able to sleep at night. Really enjoy these meds so far"
