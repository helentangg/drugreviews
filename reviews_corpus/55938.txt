"I just started a few weeks ago and it has helped stabilize my mood, give me energy. Not noticing any major side effects.  I&#039;ve had some headaches, some light nausea and some crazy dreams. But I&#039;ve always had crazy dreams. Other medications gave me much worse side effects. Effexor seems to be working for me. My daughter says that I&#039;m &quot;funny&quot; again.  I love that!"
