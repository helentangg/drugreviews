"I read hundreds of reviews when I was first prescribed this medication and so many of the were from people having taken it for 3-4 days which doesn&#039;t give you a clear indication of how the medication works. 
I was advised it would take up to 6 months to see positive results, the side effects were bad to start and lasted around a month but I&#039;m so glad I stuck with it.
I have now been on citalopram for 6 months so can confidently say it has been a miracle for me and has helped me get my life back on track."
