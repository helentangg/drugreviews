"I was taking sertraline 50 mg for depression and GAD for around 9 months. Quality of life was fantastic,side effects were terrible for the first few weeks but once the drug kicked in I was on cloud 9. My Doctor raised dosage to 100mg daily and that&#039;s when things got bad, depression returned and I was no longer sleeping. I&#039;ve been weaned off and now on another medication. Overall Sertraline is a great SSRI. If your body isn&#039;t sensitive to medication.100mg is a perfect dose."
