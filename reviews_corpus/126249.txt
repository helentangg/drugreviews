"I cannot find any medicines to work for me. Was on Viibryd 10mg for two weeks and then went to 20mg for a week and a half. I broke out in a rash for 3 days then it went into hives. Ended up in an Urgent Care, recieved cortisone shot and prednisone. Doctors think it is from Viibryd because I have not tried anything new or done anything differently. Now I&#039;m on my second prednisone pack because they have come back.  "
