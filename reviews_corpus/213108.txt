"I have been on Nardil for 30 years because of depression, panic attacks and severe anxiety.  I did gain weight while taking Nardil, but after 6 months after I started Nardil, I began to have good days again.  For me, Nardil took a long time to begin working to ease my depression, etc.  I also take one, 5 mg of Valium.  I am a senior citizen and at times it does concern me about continuing the Nardil, but as long as it keeps working and I see my psychiatrist regularly, I have faith I will be okay.  Sure, I have a few &quot;down&quot; days here and there, but never like it was before I was put on Nardil long ago.  (I had taken other &quot;older&quot; antidepressants...none of them worked until the Nardil was prescribed).  A side effect I have is intense sweating."
