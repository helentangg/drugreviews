"Took Zoloft about 12 years ago for approximately two years.  Within days of taking it my mood and overall attitude improved very  much for the better.  I was able to tolerate and enjoy things that used to set me off.  I had absolutely no side effects for at least a year, then I started to have very slight sexual side effect but nothing that I could not live with. I got off the medicines after about a year and a half and all has been well.  I was happy and content for over ten years.  Recently I noticed that I am very anxious and intolerant of people and situations just like I was years ago. I am now back on 50mgs and hope that it is as successful again as it was then."
