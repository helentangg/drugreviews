"After many wrong diagnoses and many RX&#039;s that did not solve the problem, I was finally diagnosed with atypical migraines at 24 years old and given this med to take daily. It solved the problem almost immediately. I was having daily migraines before I took it for about 2 months and didn&#039;t have a single one while on it. I then decided to go off of it and to my surprise, I was mostly migraine free for about 6 months after (aside from that time of the month).  Then, stress peaked and I found myself with almost daily migraines again. So, I&#039;ve started taking it again. Bc I take it at night to avoid day drowsiness, it is harder to wake up in the morning. I don&#039;t feel any difference in my mood. But I am pain free, hurray."
