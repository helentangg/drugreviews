"I was prescribed this medicine for anxiety. I took this stuff for a couple of days, had an adverse reaction and needed to stop. 

Since then I&#039;m going through a severe crisis. Fits of rage, urges to hurt myself or others, migraine, nausea, self harming, fainting, heart racing, paranoia, multiple trips to the ER, almost locked up in the closed psychiatric ward. 

I have never had any of the above mentioned symptoms before. I was just anxious and a little depressed. I want my life back. 

I&#039;m starting to loose hope."
