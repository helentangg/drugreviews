"Taking Lexapro was the best decision I&#039;ve ever made!! I&#039;ve struggled with anxiety and depression since I was a kid. I had never taken any medications for it until I was 24. The anxiety had taken over my life, I could barely go to work and I was up for most of my nights because my mind would be going 100 miles an hour and I couldn&#039;t get my mind to stop racing. I had a lot of social anxiety. Every single little thing would seem like such a huge task or issue. I felt completely exhausted all the time, all I wanted to do was sleep. After about 4 months of being it Lexapro I can finally say I am the happiest I&#039;ve ever been! I&#039;ve even started college which is something I thought I would never have the courage to do."
