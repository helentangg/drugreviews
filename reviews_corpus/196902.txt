"I&#039;ve tried out all sorts of drugs and never thought I would feel myself again.  This drug has helped me get my life back.  I feel positive for the first time in 4 years.  Of course, I still have my wobbles, but it has allowed me to eat, exercise and socialize, which I wasn&#039;t doing before.  I&#039;m hoping to keep building momentum, so I can lead a full and happy life, rid of anxiety, panic attacks and depression.  A god-send drug.  I don&#039;t care if its hard to wean off.  I will stay on this forever is necessary"
