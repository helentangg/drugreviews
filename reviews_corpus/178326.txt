"I found this product to be worth while taking. It&#039;s been about 3 months since I have been on it. I was really tired the first 2 weeks but now there are just yawns throughout the day. My social life has gotten better due to problems with anxiety and depression as well. Maybe due to other medication prior, my learning is better though focusing is not better due to my ADHD, and my back pain has been reduced. I have made more friends and feel much more normal more so then not, and I don&#039;t feel like I &quot;lost myself like another drug did to me in the past. I would say this isn&#039;t bad due to the mild side effects."
