"I was prescribed 20 mg  of Lexapro (I split in half) about a year ago and it did make me feel &quot;Zombie Like&quot; for the first couple days of taken it but i got used to it and it did help my anxiety A LOT. I was taken off it cause i was taken off of it about 4 months into taken it cause my insurance wouldn&#039;t cover it anymore. Its been about 6 months since I&#039;ve taken something and my doctor decided to prescribe me 10 mg of Celexa. I took my first dose last night and I was kinda iffy about taking it and was scared for about 1 hour after taking it then I started feeling unscared and more realistic as I do suffer from Depersonilization too. As of right now being my 2nd day on Celexa I can say the side effects aren&#039;t as bad as Lexapro were."
