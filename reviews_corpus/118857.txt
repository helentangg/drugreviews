"I was diagnosed recently with purely obsessional OCD and social anxiety and started on 25mg/day of Zoloft. Aside from a brief period of what I would call adjusting to lack of anxiety and a few mild side effects (nausea from time to time), Zoloft has given me peace and stability. The obsessive thoughts are mostly gone, but even when they do rear their ugly heads, the anxiety isn&#039;t there. It&#039;s also had an awesome mitigating effect on my ADHD. The side effects show up once in a while, but I&#039;m willing to take a little bit of nausea over constant obsessing and crippling anxiety any day."
