"I stayed nauseated the whole time I took it. Plus I lost all sense of judgement and reason. I started buying stuff on Ebay with a charge card. I had charged about $21,000. of stuff without concern. Thank goodness my husband figured it out and stopped me before I maxed it out at $25,000. As he was calling canceling it, I was right in the middle of another purchase. I am back on Prozac and back to normal. I have an aunt that told me that it made her lose all inhibitions about spending also. So user beware!"
