"I&#039;m one of the lucky ones with minimal side effects. I couldn&#039;t fall asleep for the first week but now I am sleeping very well and see a lot of vivid dreams. My appetite is decreased and I am losing weight which makes me happy because I tended to overeat and I needed to lose some weight. I am exercising every second day. I am taking the drug for major depressive disorder and severe anxiety. My anxiety was gone by approximately the third day of using it. My negative thinking decreased. Before taking Cymbalta I was constantly feeling fear, I was waking up at night, my thinking was severely impaired by negative thinking, I was constantly feeling like crying, I felt dumb in general and wanted to die. I&#039;m back to life now."
