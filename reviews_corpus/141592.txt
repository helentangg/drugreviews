"I am a 20 year old male and have been on 10mg of Lexapro for about 2 months.  I was experiencing panic attacks (minor and major) at least once every day at it&#039;s worst and would have one driving or at the movies assuredly every time I went or drove.  I never have taken medication regularly in my life and am otherwise a healthy person.  After experiencing a traumatic event last year, I began having panic attacks.  In the last month I believe I have had two panic attacks.  This medicine has helped me substantially.  The first week is tough, I experienced a little nausea, headaches, and neck/back muscle tightening, but that went away fairly quickly.  Just stick with it!"
