"Have only been taking this for just over two weeks and the results have been almost unbelieveable.  I&#039;d previously been taking quetiapine which made me drowsy, gave me horrible headaches and generally made me sleep and eat much more than I should have. 
For the first time in my life I feel normal, I feel relaxed, it&#039;s allowed me to re-evaluate the way I think and behave. The only side effects I&#039;ve suffered have been diarrhea and a reduced appetite but I can work with the reduced appetite better than I could deal with the increased appetite."
