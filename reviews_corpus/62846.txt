"I have used this drug for almost a year. Citalopram is much better to my physical comfort and mental peace and I have experienced few harsh side effects. One noticeable one is inability to concentrate at times and lack of short term memory. It also inhibits the libido and diminishes sexual performance. It has quietened the &quot;voices&quot; in my head and allowed me to focus on health and nutrition as a means of finding a constructive solution to mental rehabilitation. I would not recommend alcohol and caffeine products while using this drug, both can cause severe side effects and a subsequent attack of depression and anxiety."
