"Second day on medication and can already tell huge difference. I&#039;m hoping the heavy sleeping last night  (I have a 1 month old and slept through his crying) is a temporary thing. I have less appetite too and a touch of diarrhea which could all just be coincidence. Definitely hope we finally found the medicine that works we&#039;ve been trying different ones for over 3 yrs now since cymbalta stopped working for me."
