"I am 16 years old. I started taking Zoloft for my depression. I took it for a year and it worked, it made me happy for a few months but after a while I started noticing something. I had no remorse, I just didn&#039;t care about anything. I was like a zombie. someone in my family died and I didn&#039;t cry. I couldn&#039;t cry. It was very scary. I told my friends mom who also took it she said it did the same thing 2 her. So I knew I wasn&#039;t imagining things. If you feel like this or notice it in your children tell your doctor. I didn&#039;t like it at all."
