"While paroxetine tended to keep my depression at bay; I wasn&#039;t functioning at a good level emotionally.
Was on 20mg for approximately 4years, then 40mg for 3 months. When dosage was upped, I had major depressive episode (pretty much stayed in bed for 3 weeks) and realized that I had experiencing basically a &quot;flat aspect&quot; for quite some time. Also gained 20 lbs (105 to 125) in the 3 months on the 40mg. Horrible brain zaps if I missed a dose (20 or 40). Went back to 20mg for a week and have switched to Effexor (37.5/7days, then will be on 75mg daily).
Mild zings and zaps for past few days as I&#039;ve switched to the Effexor; was expecting a MUCH more horrendous transition as my zaps were extremely strong in the past."
