"After reading the reviews a month ago I decided to wait before taking this drug. I used natural supplements to boost my Seratonin level, I think that was working. I still was feeling depressed though, mostly due to family and marital problems, fix those issue and everything else would fall into place, I have been praying for that. So I decided to take this citalopram 10mg. that my Dr. felt I needed, as he said I&#039;m depressed. Which I am.
I took it for four  days and feel like a zombie, very tired, confused, not thinking clearly, weak, and can&#039;t sleep. I know it is supposed to take a few weeks, but no thank you. Most people who have reported here have been on one or more depression drugs on and off for a longtime.. never been on any drugs,"
