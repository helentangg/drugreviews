"I have suffered from migraine since I was 3 years old ( I am 58 now), and I only get a few a year. Then in 2002 my migraines went from bad to worse, I average about 4 a week. I have tried so many meds and combination of meds and they made the migraines more tolerable for awhile. I even tried Botox. I saw a new neurologist on April 4/13, and he asked me to try nortriptyline 10mg at bedtime, increasing to 20mg after a week. I have had only 2 migraines since Apr 4, and the pain is mild to moderate. I am hoping for more improvement. So far no side effects at all."
