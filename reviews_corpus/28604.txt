"Thank goodness for this medication.  I only wish I had started it earlier, before my GAD, low confidence, and suspicions hurt my marriage.  This medicine helps, even though all the therapy in the world did not touch my feelings.  I started with 5mg and felt a little improvement right away.  Went to 10mg after a particularly bad day and what a relief.  Side effects are minor so far."
