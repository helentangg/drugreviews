"I have been taking Paxil for about 6 years now off and on.  After a while they stopped working, my doctor switched me to something else. Can&#039;t remember the name but that did no good for me. I stopped taking them and am going to the doctor to go back on Paxil. It&#039;s the best treatment I have had.  It kept me calm for years, it&#039;s great for this condition."
