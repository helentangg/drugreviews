"I was cautious starting any type of medication when first diagnosed with clinical depression. I cannot express to you how thankful I am to have been prescribed fluoxetine. For the first time in years I can think clearly without anxious negative repetitive thoughts coursing through my head. I feel energized and look forward to my day. Yes there are times I still feel low, but I am able to see that the feeling is temporary. I know I can get through it. Fluoxetine saved my life."
