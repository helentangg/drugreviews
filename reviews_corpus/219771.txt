"I was diagnosed with IC shortly after the birth of my second son, in 1998.  Tried Elmiron and it did nothing to help with the pain or urgency.  I spent about 8 months thinking I had frequent UTI&#039;s, before diagnosing this correctly.  Once I went on the elavil, and changed my diet, my symptoms improved dramatically and quickly.  It worked very well.  After about 10 years, I decided to wean myself off of it and see if I could live without the medication and just watch my diet.  I was good for about a month.  The awful pain and urgency came back with a vengence.  I was in tears.  As soon as I went back on the elavil, within 1 day I was feeling almost completely normal again.  I am resigned to being on 25 mg daily of elavil for life."
