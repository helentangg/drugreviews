"I was on 10mg of Lexapro for 6 years for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. It worked great! I wanted to see if I could have a good quality of life without it since I did gain 40 pounds in that time.  I am on a weight loss program now since I had to go back on Lexapro. Withdrawal wasn&#039;t too bad. It took 4 months and I was off of it for 4 months. Had new stressful things to deal with and that&#039;s why I am taking it again. It&#039;s a great medicine I feel, just have to watch your diet!"
