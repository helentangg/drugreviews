"OUTSTANDING. It sustains sleep!! But the COST of this medicine is, well, stunning. But I still think this is a near-miraculous medicine. I am menopausal and had a &quot;pattern&quot; of waking at 3:30AM. Horrible. By taking Silenor -- and ONLY Silenor -- I am guaranteed sustained and uninterrupted sleep. THE DOWNSIDE. The cost. 

I cannot afford Silenor at this time... And it makes me very, very sad."
