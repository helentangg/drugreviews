"I have been on Lexapro 5mgs, 10mgs and 20mgs over a period of 6 years. 10mgs daily seems to be the best dosage for Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Many people don&#039;t realize that it takes 4 to 6 weeks for this medicine to work. The first 3 days I felt very good and then felt tired or depressed for a couple days. Taking Lexapro with Klonopin 0.5mgs (2x daily) helps those early stage side effects.  20mgs tends to increase aggressive behavior. After about 5 weeks I found myself to be more confident in activities and less concerned about what others would think of me. My side effects are, short term memory loss, difficulty falling asleep at night, lower sex drive, but longer Stamina when engaged in sex."
