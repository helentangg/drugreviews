"I think this medication really helped with the Interstitial Cystitis but unfortunately it gave me terrible headaches. Every morning - after about a week of taking 10 mg&#039;s of this - I&#039;d wake up with a terrible migraine. It would last all day! At first I wasn&#039;t sure if it was the medication but now I&#039;m positive. I stopped taking it (after 3 weeks of use) and my headaches all but disappeared. In my opinion, the headaches were just as bad as the Interstitial Cystitis! I don&#039;t know if anyone else here has had that experience but it certainly happened to me. Good luck everyone."
