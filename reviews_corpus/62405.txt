"I suffered from post traumatic stress disorder since I was very young. When I first received therapy at 28 I tried several anti-depression medicines with little success. I also went on and off meds, which I learned much later wasn&#039;t the correct thing to do. At 46 I found a Psychiatrist who helped me understanding my condition and prescribed Celexa. I&#039;ve been on Celexa 10mg since 2007 and know I must stay on depression medication for life. My moods are bright, I don&#039;t get &quot;stuck&quot; for long periods, no suicide thoughts, and haven&#039;t had any big panic attacks for years. I&#039;m very sensitive to many medicines and Celexa has been very good in treating my depression with anxiety, with little to no side effects. A little dry mouth and tiredness on occasion is all."
