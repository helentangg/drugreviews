"So far I am AMAZED. I have had chronic migriane for past 15 years at least twice a week on a good week, I am 45 now. Before it was occasional like once a month since a teenager. I work in a fairly high stress professional office environment. It has affected my work and mood negatively.  I have absolutely tried everything before I recently tried amitriptyline from acupuncture, diet, meditation, homeopath, blood pressure pills, massage therapy and 3 neurologists. (Imitrex works but I was to reliant on it). I was very groggy the next day for 1 week on 25 ml of amitriptyline at night around dinner time. Which didn&#039;t go well with my career and thought I would have to stop it but I read here it does go away and it did!  3 Weeks in and no migraine."
