"Started this almost 3 weeks ago, no side affects except dry/flaky skin on hands , now week 3 nauseous 24/7 and headache 24/7,  nothing is taking the headache away not imatrex (RX headache reliever) not excedrin NOTHING. I can&#039;t even eat , I feel like it&#039;s going to just come right back up. It&#039;s like it built up in my system for weeks and now my body is rejecting it. It made me feel better emotionally but physically I can&#039;t take it, I  just want to stay in bed cause I feel like crap... I know it&#039;s the med cause it started on the exact day I started the 3 rd sample bottle. I&#039;m stopping it. I haven&#039;t had a headache like this in years or been nauseous."
