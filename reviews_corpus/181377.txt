"I was only on this medicine for one month. It was too strong for me. My anxiety and depression went away completely, but I also didn&#039;t care about anything. I completely lacked motivation and would sometimes just lay around doing absolutely nothing. I didn&#039;t even have much interest in eating. I also became antisocial and didn&#039;t want to leave the house, even to walk the dog, because I didn&#039;t want my neighbors to see me or talk to me. It was the weirdest experience. It&#039;s like I barely existed that whole month."
