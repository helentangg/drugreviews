"I have been on Pristiq 100 mg for over six years now. I was 18 when I started, and I had pervasive and disturbing suicidal thoughts, serious self harm issues, and neuroticism up the wazoo. I would be dead if it weren&#039;t for taking this drug. 
I just want to say that you shouldn&#039;t be scared about taking the generic. It works just as fantastically for me as Pristiq and is significantly cheaper. "
