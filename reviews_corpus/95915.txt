"I never had a problem with this medicine. I used to take it in the past. 50 mg of Zoloft, but cut my doses down to 25 mg. Now, I&#039;m taking it again and truly look to feeling better soon. Zoloft never gave me any issues in the past and look forward to an unclouded head and I can be focused shortly."
