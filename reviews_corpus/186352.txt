"The side-effects far outweigh the benefits for me.  It took about 5 weeks for the good effects to kick in - and when they did, I felt like a huge boulder had been lifted off of my chest, I could cope with things much better.  However, the nausea is still present, even though it&#039;s been two months since I started.  What&#039;s frightening is the blurred vision.   My vision started getting blurry not long after I started Pristiq, and it has become worse.  It has gotten to the point where the words I&#039;m typing are now blurry and the laptop is less than two feet away from my face.  Am weaning myself off of this and have an appointment with my doctor next week.  Too bad... I was hopeful about this one. "
