"In reading the reviews, I take my 40mg dose of Viibryd in the morning with a light breakfast, as I am also type 2 diabetic.  The titrated dosage worked to perfection, and I an focused, energetic, and not gaining weight.  Perhaps the error is evening dosing.  I once accidentally took it at bedtime, and was awake for the whole night.  My feeling is evening dosing is an error on the part of the practitioner."
