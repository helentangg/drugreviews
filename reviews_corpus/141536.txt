"After hitting an all time low I had to do something. I was very apprehensive about taking this. The listed side effects alone are enough. I have depression, anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder. I started taking this medication at night with the 5mg. I will eventually increase to 10mg. So far this has been the best decision of my life. No side effects yet, it&#039;s only been a week. The day I 1st started this medicine I was in the worst mood of my life. The night before my husband told me he wanted to separate if I didn&#039;t change. Within an hour of taking this I immediately felt better. I hope things continue to go this well."
