"I have Fibromyalgia (for about 5 years) but no depression at all, so I was initially wary of Cymbalta because I didn&#039;t want it messing with my mood and potentially being hard to stop. But I&#039;m so glad we decided to try it! Only a few weeks so far, and already it makes a huge difference in pain levels, and also I have much more energy. I still have to take tramadol at times for higher pain levels, but much less than before. No trouble with side effects in general, although as others have mentioned, I find that extreme stress, and multiple nights in a row of little sleep, can trigger all the old symptoms to the extreme, and it takes several days to get back on track. Overall though it&#039;s a huge blessing and I feel so much more like my old self!"
