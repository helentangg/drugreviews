"Citalopram has given me my life back. I was nervous, panicky, overwhelmed by thoughts, feeling vulnerable, at times even agrophobic and like I couldn&#039;t cope.  Now I would describe myself as fairly confident, happy and self-assured. I still have some bad days but generally Citalopram has made all the difference.  I have also had therapy and joined classes such as confidence building and positivity. These classes have also made a significant difference to me. No real side effects from citalopram either, except dry mouth and feeling thirsty - which really isn&#039;t a problem."
