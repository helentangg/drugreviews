"I have used Elavil for about two years, on and off. I was prescribed this medication for a condition called Cluster headaches. Well this medicine worked like a miracle, the next morning after taking the Evail I didn%u2019t have a migraine and I had been having them like clockwork for about two weeks!! Although this is an anti-depressant (I wasn%u2019t depressed) this medicine did boost my moods and made me feel much better throughout the day. It also gave me a very restful nights sleep. This medicine has been claimed to make some people gain weight but I work out at least three to four times a week and have not gained any weight. Works wonders and if you eat healthy and work out you shouldn%u2019t see that drastic weight gain that everyone mentions!"
