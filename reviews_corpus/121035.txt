"I was having about 10 to 12 hot flashes a day. At night it was unbearable. My OB-GYN told me about the medication and started  me on 37.5 mg per day. In three days I was not having any hot flashes at all, it was great! Four months later my hot flashes begin again so he up my dose to 75 milligrams. This work for the hot flashes yet again. The only issue is,  I went out of town for the weekend I forgot to take my meds with me. I miss 3 days on the medication and the withdrawal symptoms hit me like a ton of bricks. I feel jittery, severe headache, I felt drained, my body felt flu-like. Don&#039;t miss doses!!!"
