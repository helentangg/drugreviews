"I started taking this medication because my doctor thought that I had too much stress and anxiety in my life, which was causing me to feel like I couldn&#039;t breathe. I have never taken any anti-anxiety, depression medicines before, and was very skeptical. The first few days to the first few weeks were not so great. I felt tired, depressed and just plain crappy. I worked through it and kept taking the medication. I am now a month into the medication and I feel great. I can concentrate on class, and other tasks much better without worrying about other things. My relationships are much better with my husband and child. So far so good!"
