"I have anxiety and depression. Lexapro is the first anxiety medication I have taken since I&#039;ve only been diagnosed a week ago. I can tell you that by a long shot this medication has helped me. I have major anxiety driving and the first day I was on it, my anxiety driving was 95% gone. I take 10 mg of lexapro and take 50 mg of Tranzadone to sleep at night. Both are very helpful in conjunction. Plus lexapro doesn&#039;t make me feel like a zombie !! Win win."
