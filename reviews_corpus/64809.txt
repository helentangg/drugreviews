"I just started taking 50 mg after 10 mg of celexa wasn&#039;t keeping the panic at bay. First few days I felt my head clear and the negative thoughts slip away. By day 5 I&#039;m feeling out of sorts, afraid and a bit emotional. I&#039;m cutting down to 25 mg but hoping this will all pass. I&#039;m really hoping for the medicine to give me my life back but worried about side effects."
