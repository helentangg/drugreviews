"Suffered YEARS from severe depression and anxiety.  SSRIs, SNRIs naturally didn&#039;t work, and I tried every one I could!  With Parnate (Tranylcypromine) I&#039;ve felt normal for the first time in 15 - 20 years.  I actually enjoy the flavor of food again, the green of the grass, the freshness of a nice evening breeze, as well as my old hobbies and friends and family.  I still can&#039;t believe my luck.  Also, haven&#039;t needed to change my diet at all.  Fear of these drugs is overblown and usually irrational.  Most psychiatrists today have no clue about them, so I would advise that you or a friend/relative self-educate before asking your psychiatrist about taking Parnate or another MAOI.  There are some internet sites that can help with this. Don&#039;t quit!"
