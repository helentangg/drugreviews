"I have been on Pristiq for 2 and a half weeks. The first day I was nauseated but I ate and felt much better. The first week I was very hyper in the morning when I took it. I could not drink my usual cup of coffee. The late afternoon I felt tired. This week I feel much better not hyper at all. I feel somewhat calmer and my husband agrees. I have lost 4 pounds so far and that is great. I have hypothyroidism and gained 10lbs from Synthroid. I am taking Pristiq because I have mood swings and horrible PMS. I do hope I feel more of the effects of this medication in the next few weeks. I was on Wellbutrin and Celexa before but had side effects. Pristiq has been awesome so far."
