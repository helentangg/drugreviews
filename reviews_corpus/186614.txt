"I have been on Pristiq for 2 months now.  I have past digestive problems, so when I was diagnosed with Major Depressive and Panic Attacks, I was very hesitant to try any medications, especially with nausea and constipation side effects.  Within two days, I felt tired but things began to seem not so overwhelming.  Within a week, I was able to cautiously get back into work and life, and now, I have had only one panic attack, and have had nothing other than a headache if I don&#039;t take it on time.  My energy levels returned within one week, and sex drive within two weeks.  I have even lost 10 lbs.  I never realized how bad depression was until I began to see colors again, smiling, and everyone kept asking me if I had grown and lost weight."
