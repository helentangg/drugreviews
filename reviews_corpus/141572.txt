"I was on Lexapro for over 10 yrs. LOVED it. Made me feel normal. I finally knew what people were smiling about on a spring morning. Long story short, had to say goodbye to an old friend. Lexapro worked great but stopped working after 10 yrs. Looking for a new friend. Just met Citalopram. Start taking tomorrow. 40 mg. Could be my new best friend."
