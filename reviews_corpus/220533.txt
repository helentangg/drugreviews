"December 2012 was a nightmare. I get migraine average 6x a week. My migraine comes usually 30-45min after I wake up. I was taking Zomig daily for a week each took 45-2hr and a good nap to cure the pain. Heard Zomig is not for daily use so I went to doctor. Doctor prescribe me with 10mg for night time. 1st day was amazing. Migraine free. 2nd day was migraine free. However today morning I had one but less severe. 

Overall - so far so good. Other than I&#039;m 1/2 asleep throughout the day and wake up in the morning with extreme dry mouth. I hope this medication will work for me."
