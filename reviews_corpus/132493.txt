"I was given a sample pack 3mg Silenor to help with my inability to stay asleep.  I followed the instructions and unfortunately it did not seem to work for me.  It made me very anxious and agitated during the night.  I did sleep but kept waking up.  In the morning I was very groggy and unsteady on my feet.  I felt like I had been drugged and had a minor headache all day.  
I do not think I will take it again as it is obviously not the drug for me."
