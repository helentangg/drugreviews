"I am 15 and I have had migranes ever since I can remember, but when I was around 13 it got to the point where I couldn&#039;t do anything in any of my classes because I got around 15 a day. So I stated taking amitriplynine and now I only get around 1 or 2 a week, it is a process on what the right dosage is, but it has helped me so much."
