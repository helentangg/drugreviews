"I had postpartum depression after my son was born. My doctor gave me Lexapro said to try and stick with it for 1 year. I felt so much better after the 1st week of taking it. My son is now 5 months old and I&#039;ve been taking it for 4 months already. I feel like it doesn&#039;t work anymore. I feel the depression on and off. What they say about the side effects is true. I have no interest in having sex, I have gained 10lb over a period of 4 months and can&#039;t lose them no matter how hard I try. "
