"I have been on Celexa for 30 days now and am feeling great. I have been through a lot in life, being only 22-years-old, and was in desperate need of help. I was severely depressed, shutting loved ones out, trying to figure out how I could make myself feel better. I didn&#039;t think a little pill could snap me back to reality, but I can honestly say that this is the best I have felt since I was a child. Only 30 days into it I can feel a MAJOR difference in my mood. I don&#039;t constantly feel anxious, I&#039;m not emotional or moody. I feel NORMAL. I really don&#039;t think I will ever stop taking Celexa. The only things I would say I don&#039;t like are that I have felt extremely tired and have been having extremely intense, vivid dreams. THANK YOU, CELEXA!"
