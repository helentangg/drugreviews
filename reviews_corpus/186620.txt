"I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia approximately 5 years ago. I was taking Cymbalta to help with the pain until my prescription insurance no longer covered it. My doctor gave me a months supply (samples) of Pristiq. I&#039;ve been taking it for 3 weeks now and I&#039;ve felt like myself for the first time in 5 years! My house has seen more cleaning in the past 2 weeks than it has over the past five years! I was a neat freak before Fibro and I&#039;m all of a sudden a neat freak again! I love it! I do still have pain, but I&#039;m able to control it with Darvocet. Pristiq gives me energy and ambition! I no longer have to take my daily nap(s)! I feel like I have a second lease on life! I could go on and on all day, but I need to get back to my cleaning! "
