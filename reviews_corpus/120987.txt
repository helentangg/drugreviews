"The generic versions are inconsistent so I have stuck to the original Effexor 150mg and also the Sandoz equivalent. It&#039;s a very good treatment for depression and also alleviates the symptoms of ADHD to some degree. Assume it&#039;s the effect of the anti anxiety that helps me get my work done. I tried to &quot;fool&quot; the meds by consciously thinking about depression and the sad thoughts disappeared quickly so it has a very strong and positive effect on my life."
