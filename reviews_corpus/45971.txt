"It&#039;s always a test of one person. Everyone will have anti-depressants that work best for them. I tried Lexapro and Wellbutrin. I hated Wellbutrin. Prozac gave me ZERO side effects. No sexual frustration, no irritability, and no insomnia. I&#039;m on my 6th month and just got bumped from 20mg to 40mg because of seasonal depression and feel a HUGE deal better. I&#039;ve lost 10lbs in 3 weeks because my appetite and drinking are also under control. I&#039;ve also heard Prozac is associated with weight loss. If something isn&#039;t working for you, give it a try. "
