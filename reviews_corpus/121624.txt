"Side effects are plenty, like tremors, shakes, jolts, shudders, lack of libido and seeping semen (sorry if this puts anyone off their dinner), weird dreams (initial period), yawns that make me almost pass out (initial period), double vision at night looking at bright objects. I&#039;ve been on 150mg for over a year. With all these side effects you&#039;d wonder why I keep taking it!? It&#039;s because I remember weeping driving to work, gagging before going into what other people would only find mildly stressful situations and I&#039;ve gained a great deal of control again in my life, having been promoted in work and being able to play with my kids and talk to my wife. You&#039;ll read horror stories about side effects but it has worked wonders for me."
