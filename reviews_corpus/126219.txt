"I switched from Pristiq (which I had been on for over a year) to Viibryd after my blood pressure went up.  I had some of the stomach issues at the beginning but nothing too bad.  I began with 10 mg, then 20, then to 30 mg very slowly as I had read about the side effects. In all I was on this medicine for about 8 weeks. Over this time my whole body basically bloated up.  I looked like I was pregnant!  I gained about 10 pounds and craved carbohydrates.  I was also having nightmares. Mind wise I believe I should have been at a higher dose but in the end I opted to change medication due to the stomach bloating. I have been on Celexa and Pristiq but the stomach component of Viibryd seems to affect me badly."
