"I&#039;ve been on Pristiq for two weeks.  I&#039;ve noticed a remarkable change in my energy level, mood and am no longer isolating myself.  I am also more focused. I&#039;ve lost weight on this medicine and had a dry mouth in the beginning.  It does curb my appetite and after two weeks lost 8 pounds.  I seem to be eating smaller portions.  This medicine is definitely a wonder drug for me."
