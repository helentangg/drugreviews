"I have been taking Amitriptyline for nearly a year since I had a particularly bad migraine that left me hospitalized and it lasted nearly 2 weeks.  Before that migraine, I would have less severe ones every month, however after that I would have moderate migraines daily for a couple of months.  After trying a couple of medications we tried Amitriptyline.  At first it did nothing at 25mg, so we put it up to 50mg and it made the migraines weaker but it still had them almost daily.  I then went off of it and moved to Topamax, but decided to give Amitriptyline more of a chance and we then pushed it up to 75mg.  It&#039;s been about 7 months since I started taking the 75mg and it has been so much better."
