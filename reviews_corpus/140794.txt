"I can not say enough good things about this med. I had a crazy experience with anxiety that came out of nowhere when I turned 28 and it was a long bumpy road for sure but now almost 4 months in I am back to normal. It definitely also helped me get priorities in line such as making my health a priority over late nights and drinking. I by no means was a hard partier but I had my fair share of nights out with friends. I now find it completely ok to go out, have a glass of wine and take it easy. The first month was rough. I had everything: nausea, increased anxiety, I lot almost 10 lbs from zero appetite but slowly and surely everything went away and I feel really good now. Don&#039;t get me wrong, you have to put in work emotionally but it works."
