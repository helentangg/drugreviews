"I have been taking 5 mg 1x daily in the am of Brintellix. This dosage has knocked out my depressive symptoms very effectively, but my anxiety is unchanged. My doctor is going to have me try clonazepam for the anxiety issues, but I am really pleased with what Brintellix has done for my depression. In a little over a year, I have weaned off of paroxetine and tried fluoxetine, duloxetine, bupropion, and they have had varied undesirable side effects. The whole time I&#039;ve also been taking trazodone for problems sleeping. I look forward to seeing how the clonazepam will work with the Brintellix."
