"I&#039;ve started on 25mg and steadily increased. Now I&#039;m taking 200mg every night! It does nothing for my pain, or anxiety and barely touches my insomnia.  I wake up 3-4 times every night with night terrors. I think next Drs. appointment she will increase my dosage even more.  I have extreme post traumatic stress disorder and have several fractures in my spine. All I know is my dosage is already higher than most of the comments I&#039;ve read. And my wife is on an even higher dose than me."
