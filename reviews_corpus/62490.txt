"Surprisingly, within the first 48 hours of taking this medication, I&#039;ve finally felt myself again. I&#039;m 18 years old and suffer from depression from past trauma, stress, and I also have horrible anxiety. I used to be unable to get out of bed and would cry at least a couple hours a day. Now I laugh at what would normally make me lash out in anger and cause myself to cry. I feel happy and I actually feel like I have a reason for living. This is a miracle."
