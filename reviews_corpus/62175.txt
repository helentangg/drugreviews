"(Female, 23) The side effects are awful, but go away. I experienced nausea and insomnia, weight gain, libido death, and difficulty achieving orgasm. The nausea and insomnia went away in 1.5-2 weeks, but the nausea almost made me stop taking the medication. Glad I didn&#039;t though! All side effects were gone by week 8. Be patient! This medication has worked wonders. I feel MOTIVATED and excited about my future, and I don&#039;t run away from my problems. As a side note, I may have experienced weight gain because I was not eating regularly before I began taking it. The weight gain wasn&#039;t drastic though, I just look healthy and I&#039;ve lost my sallow complexion. Overall, the adjustment period can be brutal but it is well worth it. Good luck!"
