"I was diagnosed with IC when I was only 15 years old. The doctors were not sure what they should do because I was so young. My doctor decided to put me on amitriptline and immediately I saw improvements. I am now going to be 21 and still taking 50 mg of it every night before bed. This medication is the only one of my many medications (other health problems) that I will never stop taking. I would recommend this medication to anyone struggling with IC pain .definatly talk to your doctor about it!"
