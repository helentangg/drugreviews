"I am 19 years old. I had severe panic attacks before dates and would get sick right in front of them. Also, had trouble talking to &quot;higher ups&quot; at work. My doc put me on 10 mg Lexapro for social anxiety disorder. Worked right away after the first dose. Takes away all pain and worrying. The only bad thing is I feel like my life is all in slow motion and can&#039;t be bothered about anything. Puts you in your happy place. No need to suffer anymore, there is an answer!"
