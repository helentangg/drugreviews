"I&#039;ve been taking this for 6-7 years now (started at 20mg then to 40mg now back at 20mg) and I think its time for a change for me. It&#039;s stopped working for me in the past 1 year (my anxiety has come back). I also never liked the side effects, mainly: leg muscle spasms at night, easily electrically shocked, and drowsiness."
