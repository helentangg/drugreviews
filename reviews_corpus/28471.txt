"About a year ago I lost 8 pounds in 1 week, two pounds more the next week. I couldn&#039;t sleep and constantly felt nauseous. My doctor ran every test under the sun and came back with only one conclusion:  panic attacks and severe anxiety. After I got past my initial thoughts of thinking he must be a total idiot, I asked for Lexapro.  I did 5 mg the first week, moving up to 10 the week after.  As my MD warned, the anxiety initially increases, so keep the Xanax handy. Two weeks into it I started having longer and longer periods of normalcy. Then, on week three it&#039;s like it suddenly stopped and sent me into a tailspin right back to where I started from. My Pscyh told me to go to 20mg because I didn&#039;t have quite enough. Worked like a charm!"
