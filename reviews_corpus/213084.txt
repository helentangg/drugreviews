"Tried so many anti depressants from 1982 to present then finally looked up Nardil and asked my provider to please please try it as i am tired of going back and forth on the Old and the new medications.  Started the titrade from 25 mg daily and up to 45mg twice daily with such a relief from years of depression and anxiety after diagnosed with PTSD. Felt best at the 90mg daily but now i notice the feeling is fading and I am wondering if the new batches are No good.  I speak of food for myself as i eat anything that i want and have not experienced any negative feeling. Weight gain is a real negative especially in my gut and i can seem to get rid of it."
