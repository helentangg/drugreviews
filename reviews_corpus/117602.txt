"Had a headache for over 6 months, even got scanned for a tumor.  Got glasses, avoided computer/tv, removed caffeine from diet.  Nothing.

Now taking 50mg at bed time for a little over a month with almost no headache.  Forgot to fill my prescription and went without for 2 days ... back to an extreme headache.  Headache definitely fixed by nortriptyline!"
