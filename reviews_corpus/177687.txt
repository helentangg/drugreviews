"I finally got diagnosed with Fibromyalgia, and since then I have been on a couple of trial and error medications. Lyrica remains the best so far, on leveling out my balance for pain, and all the other negative quirks that come with Fibromyalgia. I tried VENLAFAXINE (Effexor) it knocked me out like a horse tranquilizer. Never again! That&#039;s when my psych decided to try me on Cymbalta. I still take my other meds: Omeprazole, Adderal, Lyrica. [switched from Zoloft--&gt;Cymbalta]. I was to gradually increase my Cymbalta after the course of a week or so, but later spoke to my Doc and he stated my side effects were do to the increase being too fast. He suggested for me to remain at one pill for at least a month, and then speak to my psych about it. perfect!"
