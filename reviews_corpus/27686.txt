"Lexapro gave me terrible nightmares.  I jump out of bed while asleep. I tore both of my arms up and hit the closet door with my head. 
 I scream in my sleep, I break lamps with my flailing arms while I am a sleep.  Every side effect listed I have!  I fall all the time, I stumble around.  This is a terrible medicine!!  Never again!!  It seems to be taking forever to get out of my system after I stopped it (without my Dr permission).  What happens now can not be as bad as the side effects I have!!"
