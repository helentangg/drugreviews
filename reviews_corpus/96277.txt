"I&#039;ve taken 50 mg Zoloft for almost 2 years for anxiety. I love Zoloft and am so grateful for the mental freedom that it has given me. Since I have been on it I have been much, MUCH happier.  Recently, I decided that I am finally ready to embark on a healthier lifestyle. I started working out religiously 5-6 hrs/week, a combination of weight training and cardio, along with calorie monitoring of 1200-1500/day.  I have been unable to lose hardly any weight.  I&#039;ve lost 5 lbs total  I am wondering if it is because of the Zoloft?  I am now weening myself off of it to see if I am able to maintain a happy disposition.  I&#039;m hoping that I succeed in controlling my anxiety on my own &amp; will be interested to see if the weight starts coming off."
