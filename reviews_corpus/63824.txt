"I just started this medicine today I don&rsquo;t know how it&rsquo;s going to work I have been so scared to take a pill because of past experiences. I have been feeling like this for  a long time.  It started in about 2005 when stress level went sky high. I used to hold everything in and not talk about what I was going thru, always trying to make everybody happy and that as long they was happy I was good. I was a people pleaser and I was helping people and couldn&rsquo;t say no to them and that just impacted me so much that I was hurt emotionally and broken. But now I am trying this medicine because I heard so much good report I want to feel good too, I want to feel alive and happy again"
