"I was on the meds  2014 . I noticed black marks on My arms an legs unusual. I stopped taking it the marks went away. After suffering many traumatized events I went back on last year to find more random black marks on my body.  I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s working for depression.  I&#039;m still sad most days. I also have constant headaches. mood swings. Still high pain levels.  Depression runs deep. I know I need something just scared to try the list.  SMH"
