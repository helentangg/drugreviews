"Wow, I&#039;m still in shock as to how much this medication has changed my life in the past two weeks. I started on 5 mg for 6 days and then switched to 10 mg and I&#039;ve felt happier than I have ever before in my life. I wasn&#039;t aware of the extent of how bad my social anxiety and depression were until they were gone. I have a new sense of self-worth and drive for my life that I have never felt before. I am so thankful that I have found something that has made my anxiety completely gone. The only side effect I&#039;ve experienced is a little loss of appetite (used to be an emotional eater) and also have trouble staying asleep throughout the night (I think this is due to the interruption of REM sleep on an SSRI, but I could be wrong)."
