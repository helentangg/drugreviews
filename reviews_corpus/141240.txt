"Started out with 10 mg, stuck with it for probably 3-4 months, the entire time feeling sluggish, tired and lethargic.  I would kind of sit like a zombie at my desk all day long.  Did help my anxiety, because I basically couldn&#039;t feel much of any emotion at all.
Reduced to 5 mg, still does take the edge of my anxiety, which tends to come in waves, especially during the night.  However, I still feel somewhat sluggish and like my brain isn&#039;t as sharp.  I&#039;ve been on this dosage now for about 9 months, although on my doctor&#039;s advice I did try cutting it down to 2.5 or taking 5 mg every other day, but my anxiety got worse right away."
