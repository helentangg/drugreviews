"I was diagnosed with dysthymia and mild anxiety. I&#039;ve been struggling with depression since I was 16 (I&#039;m almost 25).  My mood is just typically low. Recently, the depression skyrocketed and I was suicidal. I decided to try to get medicine this time (50 mg). It&#039;s only been 2 weeks but I feel a difference. I described it to my therapist as this: there&#039;s a fence and I can&#039;t cross it. On the other side is the darkness and desolation, and I know it&#039;s there, but I can&#039;t get there. It&#039;s a strange but riveting feeling. I finally feel STABLE. I can discern and identify ridiculous depressed thoughts. I still get a little sad about things, but it&#039;s not to the same degree at all. It hasn&#039;t done much for my anxiety but then again mine was mild."
