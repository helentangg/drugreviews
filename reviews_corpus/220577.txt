"I have been on Amitriptyline for only 5 days for chronic low back and leg pain that has plagued me for years, to the point of sleep and work related disruptions. I&#039;ve popped a zillion pain killers and anti-inflammatories. Now taking only 10 mg of this medicine at night, no other medicines, and I feel better than I have in years, am virtually pain free and feel very energetic. I&#039;d say it&#039;s a miracle. I wish it had been prescribed years ago."
