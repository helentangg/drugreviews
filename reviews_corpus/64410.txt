"post natal depression took over me last year and cannot even pass a day without having an argument with my partner that almost bring us apart. After all sorts of counselling and course to put myself straight I ended up wigh sertraline. I started at 50mg and the first day I toom it, it feels like a joke. I was laughing at my partner getting annoyed which used to made me angry and irritable at him. He even ask me if what im taking is happy pill. On the first 3 days were pin and needles on my palm, stomach upset and feels like vomiting all the time. After 2 months was on 100mg sleepless night no sex drive weight gain. But im happy and feeling great until now after 10 months cant sleep again. Will see gp soon. This help me get my life back thou"
