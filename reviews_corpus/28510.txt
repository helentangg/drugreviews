"I started 5 mg two days ago and I feel better already. No more sweaty palms or burning forehead due to high anxiety! I take it in the morning so I am able to sleep at night. I tried Zoloft and Celexa and could not take either one for more than two days! Horrific side effects for me! I pray each day gets better and better! This is my first time taking an antidepressant. I highly recommend for people with anxiety! Good luck"
