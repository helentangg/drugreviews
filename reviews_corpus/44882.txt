"I&#039;ve been on this medicine for about a year now. I started at 20mg now I&#039;m at 80mg about 2 and a half months ago I was feeling good but  now I have an uncomfortable feeling like  my mind was not used to.  Now I feel like I should for normal but I don&#039;t feel normal. It&#039;s hard to explain. Thanks for reading."
