"I have been on citolapram for a number of years (since 2011?). I have had nothing but positive things to say when I am on the medication. I was diagnosed with depression in the spring of 2009, and tried a few different anti-depressants. Each one had some scary effects. I was placed on citolopram after the third anti-depressant didn&#039;t work and it has been good. I still have anxiety attacks on occasion but overall am stable and healthy and learning other coping skills for my anxiety and depression. Missing doses though leads to increased anxiety (duh!), nausea, dizziness, racing heart, trouble sleeping, irritability and some disorientation. Overall I am thankful for citolopram."
