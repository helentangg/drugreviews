"I noticed that many of the reviews on here extremely negative, but I can&#039;t say enough good things about this medication. It absolutely changed my life for the better! Most people won&#039;t go to the trouble of leaving a review unless they had a really bad experience. Don&#039;t let the bad reviews scare you...there are a lot of success stories too! I had VERY few and mild side effects(nausea the first night and cold sweats at night in the beginning). This medication reminded me what it felt like to be happy again and I finally got my life back! I used to be the first person to condemn using medicines for things like this and I went to it as a last resort because I was desperate, but I could not possibly be happier that I did it. Good luck! There is hope!"
