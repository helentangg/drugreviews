"I&#039;ve been on depression and anxiety medicine my whole life. I&#039;ve dealt with some crappy medications EFFEXOR was by far the worst thing ever. I&#039;m a 20 year old college student so I need to always be motivated. This medicine has caused everything in my life to go down hill. My grades are falling, I&#039;m constantly angry, and feel sick and not wanting to eat. I LOVE TO EAT so this concerned me very much. And today I wasn&#039;t able to get my pills refilled in time, because I&#039;ve been ridiculously lazy. So now I&#039;m going through the flu symptoms that come along with this medication if you don&#039;t take it. I feel like balling my eyes out. Because every move I make right now makes me feel like I&#039;m going to throw up. Don&#039;t take this medication. It&#039;s not worth it."
