"Horrible drug. I have switched from effexor to this because of sexual disfunction and lack of sex drive. This has improved those sex issues but the other effects are worst. I have been more irritable,angry and not happy. Small things easily make me angry inside. I notice my blood pressure higher maybe because of the drug or just being more angry inside and out. Dont take this medication. There are other better meds that are out there. I&#039;ll go back to effexor and taking viagra to become the happy champ lol."
