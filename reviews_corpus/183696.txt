"I started this pill 3 weeks ago and it is really working for me. I am much happier and my attacks are gone. The first night I had terrible pains in my stomach but after that night no more problems. I am on 60mgs and the only negative thing I have noticed about it is that if I forget to take it I get a really bad headache in the morning and feel hung over. Overall I love it."
