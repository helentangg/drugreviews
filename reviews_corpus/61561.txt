"I have been on those pills for years now after suffering from PMDD. This is THE VERY BEST. I have a history of depression, but , at the time it was prescribed to me, I was charming 27 days out of the month. 2 days prior my periods, I turned into a witch, a depressed one. It affected my relationship with my kids, my loving partner. I&#039;m saying that now, because a week ago, I ran out of them, having missed my physical. Those mood swings came back like a freight train and I literally had to beg my doctor to give me enough before my next visit. I&#039;ll be more careful next time but I can&#039;t help wondering if the symptoms are worsened if you get off it... or maybe I just forgot how bad it was!"
