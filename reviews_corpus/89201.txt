"I started on 10mg after quitting drinking and starting AA and I had to increase my dose to 20. So I&#039;ve been on 20 for a week and I was on 10 for about 3 weeks before. I feel great. My anxiety level is so low and manageable and so is my negative thinking and my anger towards everyone. I have the right perspectives just couldn&#039;t apply them before and now I find it easy to. I don&#039;t freak out, get mad, irritated and frustrated like I used to. Life is easier to handle but you still need tools. So far my sex drive is still there tho it might take a little more effort to orgasm but not bec I don&#039;t feel it as much but bec it&#039;s hard to reach a certain level fast enough. My cravings for alcohol and sweet foods is very low. I&#039;m motivated."
