"I have suffered depression since childhood, also obsessive compulsive disorder and starting in my 20&#039;s major depressive disorder w/ psychotic features and massive anxiety.  I have been on many of the SSRI&#039;s and they even tried me on lithium on one occasion, but it seemed to do nothing.  One anti depressant that did work for me for 2 years was Nefazadone,  it made me feel normal and even above the normal line.  I am also diagnosed with dysthymia.  One day the nefazadone quit working and I went into a major depression for months.  I currently am on a high dose of Venlafaxine, 300 mg a day, but it is working.  About a half hour after taking my morning meds I start to feel a lot better, and anxiety is nearly gone."
