"This message is for lbk11 I understand your frustrations. Work isn&#039;t everything. It sounds like a cancer could have grown in the area you take nortriptyline for. It sounds exactly like me at the time. I had stage 4 lymphoma and I only had weeks to live. So please get an MRI. Truly find out what wrong with you."
