"I&#039;ve had trichotillomania ever since I remember. As soon as my hair was able to reach my mouth I started to bite off my hair until high school &amp; I transitioned to pulling out my hair. My hair became so thin &amp; I had bald spots &amp; constantly got made fun of for my thin hair. Sophomore year I began to see a psychiatrist for this &amp; he prescribed me fluoxetine &amp; lamotrigine. I have never told anyone my condition except my family &amp; psychiatrist. I started off my dosage very low &amp; worked them up to the highest mg possible. I am now a freshman in college &amp; my hair is almost as thick as it was before I started pulling. I am no longer made fun of for my hair. I still pull but a lot less than I ever did. The medicines also helped with my depression."
