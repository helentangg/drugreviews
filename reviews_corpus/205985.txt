"This medication was a nightmare. I had about 3 weeks that were wonderful at first, then 3 or 4 weeks where the effects leveled out. After that, I started gaining about 3 pounds per week, felt tired, sick and had flu like symptoms constantly. I couldn&#039;t get out of bed for more than 2 hours at a time. I stopped taking this it and only now (2 1/2 months later) am I seeing any improvement. I switched doctors and was told that this is never supposed to be prescribed with high blood pressure medications or with thyroid medicines. The combination threw me into serotonin syndrome."
