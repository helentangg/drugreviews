"I have been on a few antidepressants Prozac, Zoloft. Celexa has turned out to be the best as far as side effects. I&#039;ve been on it 8 years. Just a precaution after a while it will feel like it doesn&#039;t do much, I started to skip forget and found myself in a emotional, irritable, angry, sad mood. I&#039;m back on it makes a huge difference."
