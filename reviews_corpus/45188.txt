"Re Prozac: I started this medication May 1, 2016 for Anxiety and Panic Disorder. I started at Prozac 20 mgs and felt good but it suddenly stopped working after 10 days. 10 days later, I bumped it up to 40 mgs.  At the onset of taking 20 mgs and 40 mgs, my anxiety was 5 fold, unable to sleep well, constant nausea, &amp; lost my appetite. I did use a benzo at times to reduce the anxiety which was high. 
It is now June 10, 2016, I got my appetite back and sleep pattern was back to normal. 
Prozac has made a big change in my life. I feel less anxiety and less panicky. Prozac is working pretty well thus far and haven&#039;t had to use a benzo in over 14 days. You must give Prozac at least 6 or 8 weeks and you&#039;ll know by that time if it is for you or not."
