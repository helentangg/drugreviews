"My psychiatrist placed me on this and lowered my dose of Effexor in hopes of helping me with Major Depression. I was ok on the 5mg tablets, but after 2 days on the 10mg I was agitated, irritable and suicidal. I ended up checking myself into the inpatient mental unit of my local hospital. Please note I am pretty sensitive to anti-depressant medications so that doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s a bad med; it just didn&#039;t work for me."
