"Effexor XL has worked very well for me in combating my depression. I have been very diligent in taking the medicine properly and on schedule every day at near the same time. This past weekend due to an oops at the doctor&#039;s office a refill was not called in properly to the pharmacy before I went out of town for the weekend and I left town without any Effexor. Needless to say I experienced Effexor withdrawal symptoms. Heed my warning! It&#039;s not a good idea to miss a dose and you DEFINITELY DO NOT want to miss any doses. It was awful. Don&#039;t let the script run out."
