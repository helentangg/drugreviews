"I have suffered major depression for many years and have taken almost every SSRI that has been on the market.  I recently slipped into a bout of very deep depression and was almost suicidal.  Cymbalta pulled me out of it.  I am very thankful for this medication because it brought ME back.  However, it was not working at 60mg a day so the doctor increased it to 120mg a day.  I realize that is a high dose but the benefits outweigh the risks by far in my situation.  I was in the deepest darkest depression for about 3 months and almost lost my job over it.  Cymbalta saved me... literally."
