"I got on Effexor XR and was on it for 6 months for my generalized anxiety. It didn&#039;t seem to help my anxiety, but it helped my IBS tremendously. It took away most of the pain. However, there were times it was a bit of a struggle to go, but I still was able to and I would much rather have it that way than loose. Now, I am off of it and want to get back on a low dose. I was up to the full 225 mg by the end but even the 75 helped my stomach. My stomach is now killing me and affecting my daily life. I get a lot of pain and a lot of time is spent on the toilet. I&#039;m pretty miserable sometimes and hope to get back on it or find something that works that well."
