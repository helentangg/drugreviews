"I have been taking escitalopram for just over 3 months now and have noticed an incredible positive difference. I started off on 5mg and moved up to 10mg and then 15mg. The first few weeks were difficult, I won&#039;t lie...I did experience many of the side effects, including: nausea, loss of appetite, increased anxiety/suicidal thoughts, irritability, loss of sex drive, and dry mouth. For the first week or two even the SMELL of some foods would make me so nauseous I couldn&#039;t eat them. I doubted whether I could get through it, I quit my job and was a complete wreck... I could barely leave the house. This medication changed my life; I am now able to do things I couldn&#039;t even dream of doing, and am more social. STICK IT OUT! :)"
