"PHYSICALLY ADDICTIVE
It worked amazingly for what they were prescribed for (anxiety, depression, eating disorders) at first, but coming off has been awful and the doctors don&#039;t warn you about it. 
Do not try to come off cold turkey! 
Withdrawal made me feel like there was electrical current in the back of my brain, and the longer I went without it, the shorter the intervals between the brain zaps are. I still get it sometimes, but only if I forget to take it. I became really unfocused and disorientated for 2 weeks. I couldn&#039;t have conversations or work - I had no attention span and couldn&#039;t function.  I had to go back on them. 
They only go down to 20mg so I take halves, first every day, now every other. I&#039;ve been trying to get off it for over 2 years"
