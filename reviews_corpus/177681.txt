"This was a miracle for the Fibromyalgia pain, until the excessive sweating began.  It took a long time to make the connection.  I have been off for three months, the sweating has stopped, but the pain of Fibro is creeping back.  Will have to try something else.  The sweating was such a nuisance, and it got so bad, it was frightening.
But, definitely give it a try - it may help you."
