"Starting Lexapro was tough.  Shivering with stomach cramps, for a week I constantly felt like I had taken some bad, terribly impure Ecstasy.

Once I became acclimated to the drug, my postpartum anxiety disappeared; however, I was incredibly fatigued during the day.

I also stopped caring about most things in general.  My house wasn&#039;t as clean and creative endeavors came to a halt.  My short term memory declined.  It felt like my brain was muffled.

I experienced lucid, unnerving dreams/nightmares most nights while taking Lexapro.

I gained 8 pounds in the 8 months I took it, all in my middle.  It took a long time to get this off afterward.

Getting off Lexapro was also tough, with back pain, insomnia, and 10 days of &quot;brain zaps&quot;."
