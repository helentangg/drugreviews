"Zoloft has helped me a lot. I suffered from mild depression and mild anxiety for years. I&#039;m a 38 yr old male. I requested Zoloft from the Dr. And I&#039;m on the 50mg dose. It started working right away. I felt effects the first night. I was sick the next day but that was the only time. I had some euphoria during the first couple of weeks. Next to impossible to orgasim. I have zero anxiety it&#039;s amazing. Not as depressed but didn&#039;t fully take it away but really helped. It was the right choice for me. Highly recommended. I would make the same choice."
