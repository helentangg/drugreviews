"I was doing just fine after increasing to 150mg about a year ago, but for some reason the last 4-6 month have started dreaming about the past that makes me wake up at least once or twice at night. Just don&#039;t seem to get great sleep anymore. I went up to 150mg because 100mg just wasn&#039;t helping enough, but now I don&#039;t know what to do. Dreams maybe a link of when and why my depression and social anxiety began.  I can&#039;t figure out if this is a good thing or not. Am now going down to 100 again to see if dreams become less frequent or not. I just don&#039;t know if any other medication will work."
