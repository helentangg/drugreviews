"Paxil helps me so much. I thank God for it. I&#039;ve tried so many antidepressants and none work as good as Paxil. I would have terrible anxiety and panic attacks. Now I feel calm , confident and happy. It works. I did gain a little weight because it increased my appetite but nothing exercise and a heathy diet can&#039;t fix. I rather be happy anyway."
