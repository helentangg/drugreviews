"I was suffering from ppd/a. Zoloft and lexapro made me feel worse. I wanted to try paxil but the bad reviews scared me. Good thing I listened to my doctor because it&#039;s the only thing that has helped me. Side effects weren&#039;t bad. I haven&#039;t gained weight. I feel a little hyper sometimes but that just makes me actually want to get up and do things again."
