"When I had my first son in 2004 I developed postpartum depression within two days of giving birth.  It was the most horrible manic thoughts, racing heartbeat, clenched jaw and burning sensation in my upper body.  I thankfully was able to care for my son but I was sleep deprived for 8 days...which turns your head into mush.  I can&#039;t really remember the first 2 to 3 months of his life.  I went to the my primary doctor because of all of this and they put me on Effexor it really worked.  Within one month I was feeling so much better and I haven&#039;t missed a dose since.  I continued to take Effexor in my second pregnancy and I had a great pregnancy, birth, and continue in 2010 to take it everyday."
