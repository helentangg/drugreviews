"I completed a month of the Viibryd, keeping the dosage low hoping it would be more tolerable. Unfortunately, the side-effects were just too problematic to allow me to function (dizziness, lack of concentration, dysphoria, nausea). Viibryd doesn&#039;t seem to have been a viable option for me.

I&#039;m now trying citalopram, have been on it about 5 days now and already wondering what this will do. I guess I&#039;ll see. It&#039;s frustrating to have tried so many and not gotten the relief I need to be a functioning member in society. That and it&#039;s unsettling that I feel like my doctor&#039;s just guessing. lol. thanks again for your responses.
