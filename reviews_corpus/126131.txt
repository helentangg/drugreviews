"I suffer from depression. I have been on Viibryd for 3 months. I take it at 6pm daily, and I&#039;m on 40mg/day. I previously failed Celexa, Lexapro (allergic to Lexapro), and Wellbutrin. I love Viibryd- My moods are improved, I&#039;m slower to react to angry situations, and I&#039;m sleeping better. I&#039;m noticing a nice boost in my libido. One small side effect I have is that I get what is called &#039;brain zaps&#039;. It just feels like someone is shocking my head. Quick, kind of annoying, but tolerable. I get this sometimes right before I take my daily dose- like the medicine is &#039;wearing off&#039;."
