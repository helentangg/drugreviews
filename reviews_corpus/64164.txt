"A life of aniexty for as long as I can remember. Stress and events increased my aniexty which turned into depression. I felt like I was losing my mind and couldn&#039;t find the calm through the storm. After having what I&#039;d call a melt down I knew it was more than I could do alone. Scared and shamed to take the medication route to find relief I put it off for so long. Finally I gave in and thought anything is better than how I was coping. After two weeks of laughing more, thinking/worrying less, and just waking up to a clearer mind I knew. I felt better taking my first step to a healthier, happier life. I have found 25mg has taken the edge off I needed. :) Never give up!"
