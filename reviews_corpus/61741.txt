"I used Celexa and it was rough.  I then went and looked at all the side effects and realized that THE ANXIETY IT WAS TREATING WAS ALSO A SIDE EFFECT.

I then in a last ditch effort went to a chiropractor and he changed my life.  He explained HOW CHIROPRACTIC HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH NECK AND BACK PAIN.  He explained that stress is necessary to live and is a good thing!  Our issue with stress is that our body isn&#039;t adapting properly to the stress.  Chiropractors help our nervous system flow properly so we don&#039;t need drugs by removing subluxations.  (A subluxation is an interference in the brain body connection)

If there is something you could do so you wouldn&#039;t have to deal with stress, would you?  See a subluxation based chiropractor!"
