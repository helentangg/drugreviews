"Really it&#039;s night and day for me. I wish I could have been prescribed this when I was just a teenager. I am 45 now and finally feel somewhat human. I&#039;ve always felt embarrassed about everything and I mean every thing. Have tried Prozac, Wellbutrin, Natural remedies and more. I have been sober for 9 years now. Even when everything was going well at home, work and relationships I would still be suicidal. I also have had some major depression through life, but the last two years have been the worst. For the first time I feel NORMAL! I went from saying I&#039;m sorry 1,000,000 times a day to less then 10-20 times a day in one month. I don&#039;t feel the need to over-eat like I have been and I&#039;ve already lost 11 lbs (I&#039;m twice what my weight should be). The best part is not feeling embarrassed.

The side effects are mild compared to what I&#039;ve been through all these years. Yawning a lot the first month, which has gone away. Like someone else mentioned the sexual side effects (making it harder to orgasm). I also seem to have nervous energy like bouncing my legs up and down and rocking back and forth. I get a headache once and awhile. I also slept a lot the first 2 weeks. All in all nothing compared to the side effects from my anxiety and depression. I only hope it lasts."
