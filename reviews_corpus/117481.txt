"This drug has changed my life. I used to get at least 1 headache per week, often up to 3 or 4, with nausea and extreme fatigue. I have been on the 10 mg about 3 months now and it has seriously given me my life back. I still get headaches (maybe twice per month) but they are very mild and usually really late at night. I had side effects (pretty annoying constipation and mood swings) but this has subsided almost completely. I haven&#039;t felt this good in years and I highly recommend trying this drug."
