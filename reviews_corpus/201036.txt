"Zoloft changed my life completely and I feel &quot;normal&quot; pretty much all of the time. I was too phobic to try it and for 15 yrs I suffered. I wish it didn&#039;t have to happen that way. I started literally on 6.25 mg so afraid I&#039;d get ill. Went up to 12.5 then 25 and so on. I&#039;m now on 150mg and have had zero side effects. If you&#039;re like me and phobic of meds, start on a baby dose. Even when the doc looks at you weird, just do it your way for you. You want the lowest effective dose anyway right? Start small and tell yourself this will help and not hurt you before you take it. Each day it gets easier. Best wishes for a better life."
