"I started taking citalopram about a month and a half ago. Started with 10 mg now on 20 mg. I did not have severe anxiety, however I did not feel like my old happy, carefree self. I self diagnosed myself with social anxiety and finally talked to my doctor. This medication has definitely helped me. Easier to get out of bed every day, worry less and focus on what makes me happy. Overall I feel a lot better, however it is not black and white. I still have anxiety in stressful situations but my day to day life feels easier."
