"After my mum&#039;s death my doctor put me on this and it was a life saver. I took largest dose 120 mg. It helped me deal with her death and not stay in bed. I also found my arthritis from previous yrs never bothered me anymore. Body aches gone. I did wean myself off medicine after almost 3 yrs. But all body aches and pains came back. I am looking in to Going back on it for body aches."
