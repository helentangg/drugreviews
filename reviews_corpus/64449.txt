"I have been suffering with depression since I was 9 years old. I was also diagnosed with PTSD, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and AD/HD. I was going to start medication years ago, but found out that I was pregnant and unable to start a medication. After I delivery I developed PPD bringing the end of our relationship. A year later i decided that it was time for me to start taking a medication. I started out on 25mg daily and I felt better within days, but was still have depressive episodes, so moved up to 50mg. I have been on 50 for 2 months and still have some depressive episodes during my cycle but it&#039;s manageable. I have trouble sleeping but that&#039;s really it. My appetite has lessened but nothing major."
