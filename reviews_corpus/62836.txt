"I have been taking this medication for 18 months after struggling with chronic depression my entire life. In the beginning I had severe side effects including reduced appetite, uncontrollable yawning and jaw stress, insomnia, and sweating. Despite the frustration with these effects I still noticed considerable change to my mood and anxiety level. These many months later I am still noticing a much better level of mood stability and social confidence.  Unfortunately, I have almost no sex drive and can rarely reach orgasm.  I am hoping to try to go off the drug this year and am assured by my therapist and psychiatrist that this will ready itself.  I highly suggest to anyone on antidepressants to medicate while in a committed talk therapy."
