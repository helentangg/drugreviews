"I was switched to Trintellix after several other SSRI medications didn&#039;t seem to work. I was started on 10mg, the first week I felt fine. But then its as if overnight I became a different person. I went straight into a mania phase. I wasn&#039;t sleeping, eating. I felt like I had no control of my emotions or my body. It almost cost me my marriage. Thankfully, my husband knew me well enough to know this was not normal for me and had me go back to my PCP and now I&#039;m back on Zoloft and waiting to get in with a Psychiatrist to find some other options. I don&#039;t  want to experience anything like that again."
