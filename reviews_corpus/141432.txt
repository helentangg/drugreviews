"I started taking Lexapro 10 mg 4 days ago. I already feel less anxious and panicky. I haven&#039;t been experiencing heart flutters and palpitations like I usually would from stress and anxiety. I feel more energized, outgoing, happy &amp; less stressed. It helps me sleep better at night. The only side effect that I have noticed thus far is that the medicine makes me yawn a lot, which I have heard tapers off after a few weeks of being on the medicine. Other than that I have not noticed any other issues. I think Lexapro is great!"
