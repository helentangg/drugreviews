"I started Nortriptyline about 2 months ago.  Doc started me on 10 mg/day and asked me to increase to 50 mg/day.  Started taking it at night but was over-sleeping so started taking it in the morning.  Missed one dose by 12 hours and immediately got a migraine that lasted for 4 days.  However, after 2 months, the medicine doesn&#039;t seem to be working.  I&#039;ve started getting weekly migraines again that last 4-5 days.  Have emailed my doc for help because I can&#039;t afford all the time off work and being a neglectful parent!  I had dry mouth in the beginning but that has gone away.  I used to have an uncontrollable bladder but the medication has cured that (thank goodness).  Haven&#039;t noticed weight gain."
