"I have had good results with 200mg of zoloft, and .5 clonazapam 3 times a day, for ten years. I&#039;ve tried many ssri meds, and zoloft has been the best so far. I suffer from depression, agoraphobia, panic and ocular migraine. This current combo ( sometimes I add gabapentin if I&#039;m still anxious about leaving my house) has been the most effective for my mood. I gained weight on paxil and getting off was a nightmare. No additional weight gain with the zoloft."
