"I just dropped in on the internet to see if their was something &quot;better&quot; or maybe &quot;newer&quot; than my Effexor, but after several sites I know I&#039;m still in good hands. I&#039;ve been on 150mg Effexor, or venlafaxine, for more than ten years and I&#039;ve lived a normal life since the right-medication-finding game. Yes, the withdrawals within 24 hours are dizziness so bad you shouldn&#039;t drive, but I&#039;ve asked my doctor to write a second prescription for the non-xr version in half strength and I keep that filled for emergencies, or it&#039;s open to fill in another city if I have to fill it unexpectedly. Or if I miss my dose and need it to kick in immediately"
