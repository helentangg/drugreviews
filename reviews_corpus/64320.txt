"Take this with a grain of salt, only took it once, but that once was enough. 
Took it at night, few hours later became very restless and only got 3 hours of sleep that night. Next day, it was still there and came with fury. Muscle aches everywhere, body twitches, everything. Had to take 10mg hydro to take the pain away, but still felt it even with that. 
Never taking it again, that pain was unreal."
