"I was on Paxil CR 25mg for 5 years and 37.5mg for about 1 year. My Doctor and I decided to ween me off due to feeling that it wasn&#039;t working as it used to and I didn&#039;t want to increase the dose. The weening process went too quickly and I suffered withdrawal symptoms- brain zaps, brain fog, crying, severe mood swings, just to name a few. I also had a rush of emotions that were hidden from being on it. My family and friends said that when I first started taking it, they noticed that I had been withdrawn but they thought that I was happy because my anxiety was gone. "
