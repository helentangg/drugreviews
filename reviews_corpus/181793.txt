"I started taking Prozac for SAD, seasonal affective disorder, and it worked really well for that. Well a few years ago my hubby left and I tried to increase to 40 mg but the higher dose did not work well with me, so went back to the 20mg until about 3 months . Thought I was ready to wean off, first time I did not wean right and felt awful. Next time I weaned very slowly, which was much better, Unfortunately I began to have signs  of depression again. Called my MD to get a different one even though, Prozac had worked well before. He recommended Zoloft but after reading the awful side effects from reviewers, I change my mind and have restarted Prozac. The only side effect I get with Prozac is decreased sex drive, 20 mg works for me!"
