"After putting off getting help for a very long time....I am on 40mg a day, started off with 20mg.  I also need to take beta blockers to calm my nerves. But overall these tablets are great. Don&#039;t be worried about side affects, everyone is different and you may not get any. I do feel very tired and less energetic, but in reality I was a little like this before the medication from being mentally exhausted. Only thing I find is that if I miss one tablet (from taking 2 a day), I suffer for days.  I was also very ill after having a very small amount of alcohol on them (so I just stay tea total now). But they certainly take the edge off and I don&#039;t feel like a zombie on them :)"
