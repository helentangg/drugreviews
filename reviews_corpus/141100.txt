"I started taking a very small dose of Lexapro about 7 months ago for a sudden onset of quite severe anxiety/depression. My doctor put me on 5mg because I really didn&#039;t want to be on medication. I felt a little bit of nausea, but I couldn&#039;t tell if that was the medication or just a typical side effect of my anxiety. Even the 5mg made me feel better within 2 weeks. Then, we upped my dose to 10mg a month ago, and I feel great!!! This medication has really allowed me to get back to being myself again."
