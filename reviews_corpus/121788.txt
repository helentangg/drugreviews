"Only 3 days of nausea at first. Dosage is 37.5mg. A lot calmer. But will increase dosage about a month later. Having vivid dreams at night. Having skin irritation but not sure if its caused by something else. Not confirmed. Had a severe diarrhea reaction to Flucozanole (anti-fungal pill), so I think there is an interaction between the two."
