"Dr gave this drug to my 8 yr old autistic son to help him with his fear of people. Within one month of taking it daily he went from severely underweight to severely obese without having eaten more! 3 years later he is still chunky even though he stopped taking it after one month! It ruined his metabolism and made his extremely irritated when he was on it. Will never recommend this drug unles you like weight gain."
