"I tried this drug for the first time last night and had to discontinue making dinner for my children as I felt so spaced out and my jaw and body would not stop shaking. My doctor put me on 20mg tabs and it seems like what I have heard is similar to an acid trip it&#039;s now more than 24 hours later and I still don&#039;t feel right maybe it&#039;s just not for me ? Any one had an experience like this ?"
