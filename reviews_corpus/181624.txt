"I had my first major depressive episode in the late 80&#039;s when my first child was a toddler.  I was put on 20 mg of Prozac and felt like I got my life back.  However, it seemed to quit working and the next 20 years I went through almost every SSRI there is as well as a couple of common anti-anxiety drugs and none of them seemed to work very well.  About 4 years ago I went back on Prozac and this time I was taking 60 mg for ocd.  It has worked quite well but I think my body is getting used to it again.  My doctor wants me to consider changing to Lovox.  I had thought I had already tried that in the past but I have to do something because I feel like I am slipping into the abyss again."
