"I was having some marital problems, and was unable to eat, sleep or function.  I went to the doctor after a few days and she prescribed Celexa.  I&#039;ve been taking it for 23 days.  I suffered from debilitating fatigue and sweats on days 3,4 and 5.  On day six I was able to get up on time and be functional.  I had a headache for the first 10 days, but now it is not noticeable.  I am able to drink coffee and not feel jittery.  I still have a low appetite and am losing weight, and my feelings of sexual arousal are numbed.  I feel that the edge has been taken off and that I am very level.  I feel more patient and objective.  I have terrible premenstrual Dysphoria and this past cycle, all my worst symptoms did not appear."
