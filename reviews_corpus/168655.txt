"I have suffered from major depression since my 20&#039;s, I am now 50, I have taken every antidepressant I think possible, since I have started taking Viibryd I feel human, I have more mind clarity,energy and generalized feeling of happiness. I laugh and talk a lot more! I feel like someone turned the positive switch on in my brain, it&#039;s like the sky is bluer, trees are greener, etc! I started taking this medicine after my sister told me she had started taking it and how wonderful she was feeling.  I have had absolutely no side effects except eating more but that could be because I have an appetite now.I am taking 20mg right now and have been taking it for several months. I feel like this is a miracle drug and is exactly what I have always neede"
