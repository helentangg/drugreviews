"I&#039;ve been taking it for over a year.  I have taken Lexapro before, but it stopped working.  I take 40 mg a day, I take mine in the morning. I have to say that I still have a burning in my stomach, and night sweats, but I absolutely love this medication. It&#039;s the best. I feel more myself. I don&#039;t have hateful outbursts, I don&#039;t yell at my boys, and I love the way I feel.  So thankful my doctor tried me on this."
