"Just a few weeks ago I was reading all these reviews in tears.  I am a 36 yr old mother of two &amp; suddenly I started having panic attacks.  I was so scared to start taking Zoloft because I thought it would &quot;change&quot; me, or make me feel &quot;off.&quot;  This was SO not the case! I tried everything natural I could first-- but I was still having anxiety regularly. I was also having negative thoughts that I could not stop, I would have to actively try not to think about certain things, and I really struggled with that.  I have been on Zoloft about 2 weeks and all of that has stopped!  I feel happy! I didn&#039;t even realize I had been in a funk, I feel so so SO much better now.  
To anyone reading this, you&#039;re not alone, it can and will get better!"
