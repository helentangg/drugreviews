"I was always a worrier and an anxious individual. It never came to mind to label these characteristics as someone suffering from generalized anxiety disorder. Well late last year I began to worry obsessively about my health and became completely consumed by my fearful thoughts. One panic attack led to another and before I knew what had happened, I could barely leave the house or function. That&#039;s when I realized I needed help. Admitting that I needed help was probably the hardest part of my struggle since I always thought of myself as an independent and confident person. I was put on 10mg of Lexapro and after approximately 5 weeks I was able to &quot;live&quot; again with some mild anxiety. I did gain about 10 pounds in the 9 months since starting the medication, worth it!"
