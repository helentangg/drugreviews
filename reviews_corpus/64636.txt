"My psychiatrist started me on 25 mg for a month and then upped my dose to 50 mg for my anxiety. I have to say that I&#039;m doing great. The only side effects I had was diarrhea which only lasted for a couple of days. Now the only thing I have is tingling feeling in my legs but other than that Zoloft is a life saver.  Going on two months with this medication."
