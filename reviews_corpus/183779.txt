"Added 90mg cymbalta along with provigil and seroquel - really helped me out of depression, and i&#039;m glad i take it.  can&#039;t focus very well after almost 6 mo. but that could be related to something else...i have not felt depressed like i did.  any thoughts of suicide due to anxiety, not sadness. recently doctor decreased dose...still seems to be working."
