"I started Emsam when hospitalized.  My doctor noticed the positive effects before I did.  She noticed I was thinking more clearly and more active.  After 2 weeks I began to notice my mental clarity.  After 1 month I cleaned my house in 1 day and began to shower, dress, apply make up and do my hair every day.  I did not have to think about what need to be done I JUST DID IT.  This was the first time in my life I can ever remember just being ME.  After 6 months I became allergic to the adhesive, I can no longer use Emsam.  What I wouldn&#039;t give to once again KNOW WHO I AM.  But I am lost in depression and pain.  I would gladly live with the restriction of Emsam because I WOULD BE LIVING."
