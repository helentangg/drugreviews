"I started this medication for Bulimia. It worked - partially.  From the day I took it I did not purge the entire time I was on it. I still binged though, and I gained weight. I didn&#039;t have an urge to exercise and ultimately that is why I am going off it. As well as the lack of energy, motivation and interest to exercise, that spilled over into the rest of my life. 
I lost interest in socializing, working, cleaning, cooking (very hard to just do anyways), I stopped sleeping, and after a year I didn&#039;t want to even watch tv or read. It&#039;s VERY hard to get off of and I insist people read reviews on withdrawing. It&#039;s been tough physically although I feel better mentally already. It served its purpose, but I should have gone off it after 6 months."
