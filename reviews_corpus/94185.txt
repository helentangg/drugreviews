"I have tried just about every medication for depression, and all of them eventually quit working for me.  I was on Cymbalta, Ritalin, and Abilify.    I was prescribed the Brintellix (started at 10mg. and now on 20mg.) to replace the Cymbalta I was previously on.  I am not feeling any better now after being on it for 2 months.  I had high hopes, but unfortunately it hasn&#039;t done much, if anything for me."
