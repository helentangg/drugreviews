"This med  works well for norepinephrine uptake inhibition which is my problem.  However, it can cause anorgasmia in men over 50 years of age.  I can have an erection and sexual intercourse but I never finish the job.  One of the side effects listed for this drug if you read the small print.  I stopped using it years ago and still have side effects."
