"Did not have the best experience with this medication, but antidepressants and anxiety medications react differently for each person. For the 5 months that I was on Prozac, it improved my anxiety, but every time my dosage was changed, my depression got much worse and fluctuated  greatly. It got so bad that I had to switch medications. Again, every medication reacts differently for everyone."
