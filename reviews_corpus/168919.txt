"I began taking Viibryd 10mg 3 months ago.  Quickly began having stomach pain, worsening of insomnia and diarrhea.  Couldn&#039;t go up to 20mg because of worsening of side effects. Today, Sept. 1, I took it and again, having uncontrollable diarrhea. Seeing my doctor on the third and am going to ask for a something else.  All of the SSRIs and SNRIs have affected my GI track but not as bad as this one.  Life long history of depression and anxiety.  Searching for the right antidepressant for over 20 years."
