"Took this for leg pain that was from unknown cause, possibly pinched nerve or peripheral neuropathy.  It seemed to help some with pain, maybe 30% reduction at 25mg dose.  But I was sleeping 20 hours a day, real groggy when awake, and having severe stomach pains and constipation.  I stopped after 2 weeks of this.  I thought it was just side effects but my doctor diagnosed it as an allergic reaction."
