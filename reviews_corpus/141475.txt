"I am a 30 year old female who has suffered from depression and anxiety my entire life and it got worse after I had my daughter.  Two years after she was born, I couldnt take it anymore and I had to get help.  I talked to my doctor and was put on Lexapro, 10 mg.  I hated it at first.  I was dizzy and &quot;swimmy&quot; feeling, couldnt sleep, couldnt eat, felt out of it, couldn&#039;t care less about things that were going on.  This only lasted about a week!  Then, I could gradually feel myself getting used to it.  My next appt, my dosage was upped to 20 mg (he started me on 10 because he wanted to ease me into it knowing I was a mom and worked full time; i still needed to function).  Let me just say that Lexapro SAVED MY LIFE!!  I love it and swear by it!"
