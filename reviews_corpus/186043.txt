"I have been on Pristiq for almost 4 years. I have almost no go to pain on this medication however the side effects of no sexual drive and no emotions are so much better than the excruciating pain I was in. I highly recommend this medication for fibro but please read every bit of information you can about trying to get off of it. Makes you want to die with the withdraws.  And I don&#039;t have health insurance so I have to pay $335 per month but it is so worth it to be able to function in life."
