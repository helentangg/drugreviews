"I have been taking Lexapro 10mg for 4 months for anxiety and panic attack disorder with mild OCD. The panic attacks went away completely and my anxiety was lessened. I am no longer walking around with a constant lump in my stomach and I feel stable. I had chest pains from the anxiety and they also went away after a month on Lexapro. If you experience side effects in the beginning please try to stick it out it is worth it. I had some side effects (restlessness, insomnia, worsening of panic episodes, dry mouth and sweating) but they went away after 4 weeks. The only bad thing about Lexapro is the weight gain. I gained 12 lbs in 2 months. Recently I had to up my dose to 15mg, when my dad died and I started feeling anxious again. Good luck all."
