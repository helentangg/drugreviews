"After a year of having my daughter I had postpartum symptoms and went straight to doctor because after my son 5 yrs earlier I waited and it was truly a nightmare, worst thing that had happened to me. Effexor really helped then but took longer to work because I was so sick. Effexor is a life saver and this time it worked right away....I didn&#039;t wait so long."
