"The only reason it&#039;s not a 10 for me is side effects, which were very significant at first but have gotten well into a reasonable range. I researched heavily before starting, know it can be hell to discontinue, and if the relief hadn&#039;t been so immense within days from both pain and anxiety I probably would have stopped it--glad I didn&#039;t. Took about 5-6 weeks for depression to get under control, but I feel great now. No cognitive issues like Neurotin, pain meds, and Ativan, no sleepiness for me (sleeplessness was a bigger problem at first). I have osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, lumbar disk pain, GAD, chronic depression issues."
