"I had suffered with mild depression for quite a few years, The Dr. had prescribed several anti-depressants over the years, with mild effectiveness, so I stopped taking them. When I was in my mid 30&#039;s, I had an episode where I thought I was having a heart attack. After going to the ER, I was diagnosed with having panic disorder. I was totally embarrassed and thought I was being a hypocondriac. These panic attacks continued on and on. I had enough, and told my Dr. about it. She prescribed Lexapro. I reluctantly took it, thinking it would be like the others.I was totally wrong. I finally felt like my true self....not afraid, or anxious and no more panic attacks! I can finally live my life without fear. So thankful for this medication."
