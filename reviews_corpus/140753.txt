"I posted on here a couple of days ago to say I was starting Esitalo. Well, 3rd day in and I had the worst panic attack of my life, passed out, vomited, was dripping with sweat. The first 2 days were so easy but have decided not to keep taking it. Will head back to my doctor. Don&#039;t think this drug is for me."
