"I usually don&#039;t give medicines a 10, but I honestly had no side effects from this AND it worked. At least, I only get them if I forget to take my dosage, but that would be withdrawals. I have energy from this medicine and it helps me to concentrate. It also supresses my appetite, which is a big change, since other antidepressants I&#039;ve been on have made me hungrier. All in all a great drug."
