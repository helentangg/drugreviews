"I started taking Citalopram 12 years ago as a teenage for anxiety and depression.  I have consistently taken it as an adult for the past seven years for anxiety.  I have found that my optimal dose is 20mg and also have a sprinkle of Clanazopam a day works best to treat my anxiety.  Things as simple as be anxious to answer a phone are rarely an issue for me.  I take it at night as it makes me tired and a little nauseous if I take it in the morning.  My quality of life is better when I am using my medication regularly.  I hope you find your right fit."
