"I have suffered from Anxiety and Panic attacks since my 20&#039;s sporadically. Now in my 40&#039;s recurrence has significantly increased due to a series of personal events to a point that I was starting to be afraid of being alone.  I was hesitant to initiate medication but 3 weeks into it I feel the best I have felt in a long time. The first two weeks are tough, with nausea, dizzyness and headaches but it is worth it."
