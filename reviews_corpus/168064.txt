"I am currently active duty in the military and suffer from severe panic attacks and depression. I&#039;ve been put on serveral different medications including k-pin, zanax, ativan and others. All helped a little but only for an hour or so, so I was taking them constantly. Tofranil has given me my sanity back. The first day taking it I saw an immediate change. I did not have a panic attack for the first time in an entire year and my mood seemed to improve a little. I strongly believe this medication should be tried first before attempting to try ativan or any other benzodiazepines."
