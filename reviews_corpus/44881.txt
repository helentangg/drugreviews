"Started on fluoxetine about a year ago after starting to experience panic attacks for the first time in my life after a major life change. Have dealt with social anxiety and generalized anxiety disorders without any treatment for years. Along with CBT fluoxetine has given me my life back truly, for a while I never thought I would be okay again or be able to get back to feeling normal, I convinced myself that I was having heart attacks and strokes (at 18 years old) because of the panic symptoms and I ended up at urgent care several times because of this. This medication is truly the best and I give it so much credit for getting my life back."
