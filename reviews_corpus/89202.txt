"Best. I started taking this and thought oh this isn&#039;t going to help me... It was maybe 2 months in and I didn&#039;t feel different. After about 4 months taking it I was a completely different person when it came to my anxiety and panic attacks. I completely stopped having them and I was just overall a more stress free person. By far one of my favorites.. I recommend this to anyone that has very bad anxiety and doesn&#039;t want to be on something addictive like benzodiazepines."
