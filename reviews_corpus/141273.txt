"I had crippling anxiety for about a decade (childhood to early twenties). Panic attacks, social anxiety, and &quot;generalized anxiety&quot; were some of the titles I had gotten. Bottom line I couldn&#039;t interact with others, perform simple tasks, speak in public, make eye contact, the list goes on. I had HORRIBLE anxiety panic and depression for years. I developed a pretty serious drinking problem because I was not being treated for anxiety! I was suicidal and finally sought help. Lexapro 10mg at first. I didn&#039;t feel different the first month or so. You need to give Lexapro time! I am 100% a different person. People think I am calm, confident, and put together. I feel no panic. No irrational anxiety. It saved my life."
