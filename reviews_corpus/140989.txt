"I can&#039;t believe a drug like this exists. I&#039;ve been suffering mentally and emotionally with OCD for so many years because I thought I was out of options. I&#039;ve tried Paxil, Prozac, Wellbutrin, and trazadone. Most had side effects so bad, I couldn&#039;t keep taking them. But years later, I decided to try again.
   The first 9 days were awful with insomnia, flu like symptoms, loss of appetite, cold sweats and a general &quot;loopy&quot; feeling. I wanted to stop taking it so bad, but the reviews on this site made me want to keep trying because I really felt brand new mentally. 
   When I woke up in the 10th day, I felt amazing! The impulsive thoughts are mild and manageable with the techniques from my therapist, and I feel better than I have in years."
