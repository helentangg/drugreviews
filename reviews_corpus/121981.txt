"Effexor gave me my life back again. I was so severely depressed that I had to struggle to find a reason to live everyday, I was very  suicidal. I was no longer able to function. 4 weeks after starting Effexor I was returned to my &#039;normal&#039; self. I was happy and could feel pleasure again and I was excited about life. I have experienced a few minor side effects like constipation and nausea with dosage increases, but the benefits far outweigh the minor side effects!"
