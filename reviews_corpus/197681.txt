"After suffering from major depression and anxiety for many years I had given up any hope of ever feeling &quot;normal&quot; again.  After being hospitalized I was placed on Pristiq and walked out of the hospital a week later feeling better than I had in 10 years.  For me this has been a miracle drug."
