"I was taking Paxil for both depression and anxiety.  It worked very well for me for the past four years.  My husband could definitely tell the difference, and if I missed a dose, the effect was immediate.  However, I was not aware that it could cause weight gain, and I have gained over 40 pounds even though I am eating healthy and exercising."
