"I had been in and out of the hospital for many years, tried all classes of anti depressants and even several in different classes, BICYCLICS, TRICYCLICS, then most of the SSRI&#039;s.  After continuing to get worse, my doctor and I decided to try ECT (shock treatment). I received 13 treatments (and no, it was nothing like One Flew Over The Cookoo&#039;s Nest lol) but it also didn&#039;t help at all.  Thirty years burning down the road,  nowhere to run, got nowhere to go... he, as a last ditch effort, tried Nardil and to almost sound trite, I pulled a full 180 degree turn around. 
There were a few side-effects, some weight gain and a lessor libido and difficulty to orgasm,  though if you knew me now, you&#039;d know NONE of these side effects exist any longer!"
