"For those of you worrying about taking fluoxetine I hope this will help. I&#039;ve been having crippling panic attacks for the last 3 months and I was diagnosed with general anxiety disorder by my GP, then a consultant psychiatrist. I&#039;ve tried CBT during this time which helped explain about what my body was doing, releasing large amounts of adrenaline, fight or flight responses etc but it didn&#039;t really help. I also managed to convince myself that fluoxetine which I was prescribed early on could make things worse. Following some suicidal thoughts I decided what the hell, it can&#039;t be any worse and I took my first 20mg tablet 10 days ago and it has helped so much already. Only minor side effects so far, headaches and a little dizziness."
