"I tried this medicine and it cured my depression within a matter of days. I felt great and was seeing the world in a different light. Good energy and  just felt good in general. Problem is I couldn&#039;t sleep. I was on 15 mg. I adjusted the dose down to 10 mg and the antidepressant effects were gone. I had to stop a great medicine due to insomnia."
