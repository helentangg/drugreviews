"I have severe anxiety and depression. The last month I&#039;ve had a bout of insomnia, it&#039;s been horrible. I went on welbutrin about a Month ago, Bad idea for me, it was one of the worst meds I&#039;ve been on. I also wasn&#039;t myself, did a couple regrettable things, and was almost hit by a car on my bike! I&#039;ve now been on citalopram for 3 days and I already feel better, also I was on effector for 7 years, it helped but it was tough to get off of, and I always had brain zaps.. and it stopped working. Also I take 10 mg of valium twice a day, and the combo seems to work well for me, they even each other out. . . Life has been very difficult, I shake so much I can&#039;t even write a letter.. I&#039;m hoping things get better, don&#039;t feel alone ppl. We can do it!"
