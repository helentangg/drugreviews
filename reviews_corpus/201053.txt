"I&#039;ve been on 50 mg of Zoloft for 5 days. Believe it or not I feel a little better already. I got up this morning and cleaned my entire house. My mood is better with my kids and people around me. I&#039;m not where I want to be but it&#039;s still early. My only complaint is severe gas. I can&#039;t seem to make it stop no matter what I try ( beano, gas x) but I&#039;m gonna keep going for now. It feels good not having to fight with your own brain everyday to &quot;try&quot; to be or &quot;act&quot; happy. Good luck to everyone. :)"
