"Three years ago I developed bad pain, numbess and tingling in my right arm, I was referred for physio and was
 told I had a trapped nerve in my neck. The pain hung around for a couple of months but then I was prescribed amitriptyline. Within two weeks the pain had stopped. Not sure if this was down to the medicine or was just a coincidence but the pain has now come back so I will be trying it again."
