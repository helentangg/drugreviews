"I don&#039;t know where to start. For two years I have had sleep issues because of anxiety and panic attacks. My sleep quality was non existant. Insomnia, restless legs, aches, tension headaches because of it. Everything is a struggle when you can&#039;t sleep, especially for long periods of time.
This medication was prescribed for migraines and at 10mg it has changed everything!! It doesn&#039;t make me drowsy but when I sleep it&#039;s such a deep sleep. I literally go to sleep and wake up on my alarm!! It&#039;s bliss. I do have some side effects, migraines, dizziness and dry mouth but in comparison it&#039;s 10 fold better."
