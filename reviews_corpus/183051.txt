"Started Cymbalta for depression about three months ago. Also suffer from fibromyagia and anxiety. Found at 90 mg my fibromyagia hip and neck pain significantly reduced but had the side effect of extreme itching. At one point my lips and eyes felt sunburnt and began having trouble swallowing. Slowly reducing dose now on 60 mg plus 20 of Prozac. BE AWARE do not suddenly stop this medicine. Missed two days due to script and had the worst withdrawal I have experienced in 27 years of antidepressants,
uncontrolled crying and panic. Not sure where to go from here."
