"Worked quickly (or it was in my head), lots of yawning, by week 4 very drowsy in the morning on my 90 minute drive to work so started taking it after I got to work which is better for society in general. Sometimes restless sleep. Having said that, I had a lot negative thoughts about my life that I don&#039;t notice or dwell on now so I am really good with these minor side effects. I&#039;m much happier, less irritable and family recognized it easily. I&#039;m genuinely happy with it and thankfully no nasty side effects (thus far)."
