"I took Viibryd for 3 months, as in spite of initial side effects, I really wanted to give it a shot, since I&#039;ve tried virtually everything else. The sexual side effects began after the very first low-dose tablet and continued until I quit cold turkey after 3 months. I&#039;m 57 and went from enjoying sex with my wife 2 to 3 times a week, to almost complete anorgasmia while on Viibryd. Three days after quitting I was almost back to normal, and within a week I was back to 100%. The best I can say: virtually no side effects of the withdrawal, in fact the frequent headaches I had while taking it have ceased."
