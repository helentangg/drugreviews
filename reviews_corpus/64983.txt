"Zoloft gives me no negative side effects, no weight gain, no &quot;zombie&quot; effect, the only problem is that it makes me pretty restless when trying to fall asleep, but it isn&#039;t a huge problem. It really helps me with my agoraphobia, two months ago I could barely leave the house. I also tried Paxil, Prozac, and Lexapro - all of which did not help much. Zoloft it is."
