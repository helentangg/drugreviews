"I experienced my first migraine when I was roughly 10 years old. I&#039;m 32 now. Last month (July 2010) I had a particularly vicious attack which lasted 1 1/2 weeks. Following a few days of relative calm, a second migraine (or continuation of the previous one... who knows?) occurred and essentially disabled me for an additional 1 1/2 weeks. After much research, I talked to my physician and decided on a treatment plan which includes taking 25mg of amitriptyline (Elavil) at bedtime every night, as well as Maxalt MLT and a nausea drug when needed. I&#039;ve been taking the amitriptyline for nearly two weeks now and so far so good. The side effects are noticeable, however, and include drowsiness, fatigue and dry mouth. Will keep you posted."
