"Upon first starting escitalopram I experienced some mild side effects of insomnia, jaw grinding, and a small increase in anxiety. After a week the symptoms pretty much subsided. I took it for 6 more weeks at 20mg and felt no difference in my mood or anxiety. Only the insomnia remained. So I stopped the medicine. Nothing positive, nothing hugely negative. "
