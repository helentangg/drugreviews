"I love this medication! I was on Zoloft and was a zombie! I couldn&#039;t sleep, and with a newborn sleep was critical to me! I also gained a lot of weight! I have no issues sleeping now and generally have a more positive mood and am losing weight. You can tell when I don&#039;t take this! It&#039;s a dream!"
