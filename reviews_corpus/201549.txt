"Suffered from anxiety most of my life, then around 23 suffered a panic attack which caused me problems until my late 40&#039;s when my doctor put me on Zoloft. Huge turnaround. Zero anxiety. While I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll ever forget the fear of panic attacks, I haven&#039;t had one since, and can do most things I used to be afraid of, Long Bridges, Elevators, etc."
