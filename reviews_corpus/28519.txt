"I felt on a deep depression/anxiety my &quot;great Doctor&quot; put me on Lexapro 20mg. Two months later I was back at work and felt like a totally new me! I stopped the medication after six months and until now I feel great. I have no need to go back on the medicine. However, if the need arrives I will definitely will consider Lexapro.....a life saver medicine with no side effects at all to my body."
