"I&#039;ve been on brintellix for ~3 months and it has changed my life. My depression was very severe- daily anxiety, immobilized from crying and panicking... this was related to PTSD and I was consumed with feelings of guilt, shame, and thought of suicide several times.  I started on 10 mg, had no side effects at all (maybe a little continued jaw tightness), and felt the effects within a week. I already had reduced anxiety, and cut the amount of xanax I would take in half. Then as time went on, the anxiety and depression started fading away entirely and my mood was elevated. I could think clearly, more energy, more motivation for the first time in months.  Brintellix combined with therapy cured me. I increased to 20 mg and feel better than ever."
