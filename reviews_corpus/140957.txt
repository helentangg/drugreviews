"I had suffered debilitating anxiety and depression for 4 years prior to going on this drug. My brain would not shut up. I would suffer just sitting there as my brain made me hyper aware of my own thoughts, feelings and anxiety. My head was a noisy mess. I couldn&#039;t relax. I was regularly very stressed for no reason. I would think about things that bothered me often. My relationships suffered.

This drug made my mind silent. This drug gave me my life back. It made me better. It took some time to work (about 8 weeks) but when it did it was amazing. The thing is when your sick like this you feel hopeless. It feels like nothing at all can make you better: that you are doomed. This drug can make you normal again!"
