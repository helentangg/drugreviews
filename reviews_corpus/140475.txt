"I&#039;ve suffered with social anxiety for around 2 years , I wouldn&#039;t leave my house or my bedroom it was so so bad I even had to drop out of school over it.   A year passed and my anxiety got much worse I felt like I was going crazy. Social anxiety turned into anxiety all together I felt like I was loosing my mind. I looked in the mirror and didn&#039;t know who I was I was hallucinating when I closed my eyes seeing pictures and objects. I would even talk to myself like a mini conversation going into my head. I got so so depressed over it where I would cry every single day and stay in bed. I became so suicidal. I started taking 5mg lexapro and it changed my life I still suffer with the thoughts but  so bad anymore I can get out of bed and enjoy life"
