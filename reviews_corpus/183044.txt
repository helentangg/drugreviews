"I&#039;ve suffered from anxiety and  depression for years...my attitude was bad, my outlook on life was bleak, I stressed about everything and I worried constantly. I&#039;ve tried several different meds like Effexor, Wellbutrin, and Citalopram but those made me feel weird  and paranoid and then my anxiety increased. I almost gave up on trying to cure this mess of depression and anxiety I have  but after I started on Cymbalta 3 days ago  I immediately felt great!  I feel so much more alive!  The first day I took it  I ran to the toilet and vomited but right afterward I started to feel amazing!  Now I&#039;m on day 3 and haven&#039;t experienced any nausea or vomiting at all.  I had sex with my boyfriend yesterday and I climaxed as usual.   Cymbalta is GREAT!"
