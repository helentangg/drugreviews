"I started this two months ago to help with my light depression and anxiety problems as a long-term replacement for Xanax. So far I haven&#039;t had to use my Xanax in almost a month. I didn&#039;t think this would do much but I was wrong. The first two-three weeks I had some mild nausea and tiredness but that went away pretty quickly."
