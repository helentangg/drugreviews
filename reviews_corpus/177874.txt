"I was diagnosed with chronic depression and put on 30 mg.  I used to cry at least once each day.  I have been on Cymbalta for the last 25 days and I have not even cried once.  For me it only caused nausea and I lost about 3kgs, which for me was not a side effect but a motivation to use the medicine."
