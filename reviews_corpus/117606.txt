"I was actually homebound with post infectious IBS. The pain in my upper abdomen wore me down. I couldn&#039;t do anything. This lasted from March of 2014 to March of 2015. I thought I was going to die. Finally a doctor at U of M prescribed nortriptyline 10mg at bedtime. It worked within a few days. My pain was gone. I am now working with a dietician and testing foods to see if there is a trigger to my IBS. But I can have a decent life now!"
