"The first few weeks were hell. Be warned when you take this drug you may (like me) feel worse. I was miserable, I was so sick I couldn&#039;t eat and the headaches and insomnia were unbelievable. The depression seemed to be worse too. I pushed through it and two months later I feel completely normal and strong again. Citalopram will make you the person you are suppose to be. I was always anti antidepressants and I am very fit and active so don&#039;t judge yourself for taking them. I have not gained any weight. I think if you keep active and eat well it shouldn&#039;t affect you that way. I have had a hard time lately through personal problems but this drug is a life saver and I am still happy and together despite everything I have had to deal with."
