"I am a 53 year old woman who took Cymbalta 90mg/day for years (pain from spinal degeneration and arthritis).  I ran out 6 weeks ago, and my doctor couldn&#039;t be reached to renew my prescription. I didn&#039;t feel very well for a few days, but then felt like I had before when I was taking Cymbalta (i.e., I realized it wasn&#039;t helping my pain) so I didn&#039;t restart it. I then began experiencing dreadful hot flashes and bed-drenching night sweats.  After three weeks of this, I knew it wasn&#039;t Cymbalta withdrawal...the Cymbalta had been controlling what I just thought was a smooth-sailing menopause!  I got my prescription refilled, but tried just taking 30 mg...and within days the hot flashes and night sweats stopped.  Very effective!"
