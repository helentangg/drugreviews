"I have had anxiety since childhood. I never knew what it felt like to be without it until the first time I took Lexapro. It was amazing to feel &quot;normal&quot; for the first time. I had been on Zoloft and Prozac before and neither made me feel normal. I&#039;ve had to quit Lexapro due to insurance at times and being without it is not something I ever want to do. I&#039;ve tried Celexa and the generic forms as well but they come with sexual side effects. With Lexapro I have very little sexual effects. In fact, it seems to enhance orgasm for me. Initial side effects when starting it included very bad diarrhea for a week or two, but it goes away. I take 20mg which seems to be perfect. 10mg didn&#039;t do the trick. If you haven&#039;t tried it, give it a shot."
