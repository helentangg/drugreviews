"I started taking cymbalta when I turned 30!! Literally no side effects no brain zaps bad thoughts anything!!!! I take 30 mg once a day to keep my body from seizing up. I do that during an anxiety attack and at first they put me on Zoloft and lorazepam!! That experience was horrible!! I was so scared to try anything else because of that. Until one day a doctor handed me the pill and said take it..take it now!! I did and called my mom all in a panic. I am very reactive to medicine too which is also odd. Within 30 mins of talking to my mom all panicked out.. I just felt my whole body relax and said to myself, why I&#039;m I freaking out? This medicine has truly saved my life!! My abilities to do things without being afraid!!"
