"Works okay for me. I went on it because Cipralex (Lexapro) pooped out on me. Doesn&#039;t deaden my emotions as much as other drugs. Anxiety is pretty much non-existent now but my depression remains. No side effects. I put on a lot of weight on Cipralex and it hasn&#039;t come off while on Cymbalta, but it hasn&#039;t increased either. I haven&#039;t had any notable side effects. Oddly, I did have an irritated sciatic nerve when I started Cymbalta and while I wasn&#039;t put on it for that, it did kind of help that too."
