"I wouldn&#039;t wish this medicine on my worst enemy. There are other major issues with this medicine than the horrific uptake and withdrawal symptoms.  If I missed one single dose of this medication, it made me crazy. Mood swings, dizziness, suicidal thoughts, blurry vision, and more. The only reason I gave it a 2 was because if you&#039;re PERFECT at taking your medication, then it might work for you. Maybe. But be ready for the withdrawals because it was the worst few weeks of my life."
