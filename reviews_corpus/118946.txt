"I&#039;ve been taking Zoloft 100mg for about 6 months now, it really has changed my life. Before medication, I wasn&#039;t leaving the house, had very little social contact and my anxiety was through the roof. Zoloft has been amazing for me, my mood has improved and I&#039;m getting out of the house and keeping in touch with friends and family. I still have my bad days and also feel groggy most mornings but other than that I&#039;ve had great results while taking Zoloft."
