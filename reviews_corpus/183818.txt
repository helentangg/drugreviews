"I have been on this medication for 1.5yrs &amp; it has been GREAT! Was on Paxil for 3 yrs prior to switching to Cymbalta. It worked in about 3 days and i havent had any abnormal feelings of anxiety since I started this med. I haven&#039;t had any side effects from taking it. I had experienced some weight gain from Paxil, but none on Cymbalta. The only thing is that if you miss a dose, your terrible headache will remind u that u forgot to take it! Other than that, it&#039;s been great."
