"I was horribly nauseous and threw up everyday for the first month. The itching was horrible too for the first month as well, but I suffered through and Brintellix has been a miracle drug for me. I have been taking it for over 4 months now. I am slowly feeling the depression creep back in. I am not sure if I need the dosage increased or if it is just everything I am having to deal with in my life right now. I am currently taking 10 mg at night. No side effects at all now."
