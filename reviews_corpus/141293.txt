"Have taken for two years. It&#039;s the only SSRI I could take. All the other SSRI&#039;s had terrible side-effects. It really helped with depression and anxiety. It has really helped me to sleep. There are some side effects however. It has really decreased my libido and does make you gain weight. Because of these effects I have decreased my dosage. It is a very good medicine and I would highly recommend it."
