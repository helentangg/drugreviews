"This medication changed my life! Looking back, I had always struggled with social anxiety. I made it through college without any medication due to self-medication with drugs and alcohol and alienating myself. The panic attacks began when I secured a full-time job and became financially independent. Something as simple as ordering a pizza caused me a great deal of anxiety. Dealing with all of the social interactions it takes to be a fully functional adult was too much. I would have about 5 panic attacks a week. My doctor gave me only 25mg of Sertraline and after about 2 weeks everything was different. No more attacks. No more sleep paralysis. My sex drive actually increased because I could enjoy it! I got a promotion! I&#039;m so thankful."
