"I was prescribed this medicine in 2004 to help with depression.  Instead of getting better I progressively got worse and my psychiatrist&#039;s answer was to put me on Xanax.  Long story short, I ended up in a psychiatric hospital.  Turns out I have bipolar II and since I wasn&#039;t on a mood stabilizer I essentially lost my mind.  Horrible experience."
