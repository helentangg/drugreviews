"Been on this tablet about a month now. Even though my doctor said it won&#039;t take effect till about 6 weeks, it practically worked for me after a day because my nervous system would be very sensitive to any tablets. I&#039;m on this tablet about a month now and to be honest it has taken away the majority of my anxiety, and panic attacks which I used to get severely. I still get flutters in my heart and rapid heart beat sometimes but nothing I can&#039;t handle. My dreams are really weird sometimes like really strange but that&#039;s to be expected I suppose. Took 20mg forgetting was supposed to take 10mg, was way too strong for me so on 10mg now, can function with that. "
