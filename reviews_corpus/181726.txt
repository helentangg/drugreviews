"i had taken prozac for 3 years and had been off for 1 year. In the 3 years that i took it, it was really amazing. I stopped having irrational thoughts, stopped feeling hopeless and could make a decision without going crazy. I stopped taking it after 3 years thinking that i may not need it any more. The depression  came back gradually during this time getting worse day by day. Nothing bad was happening in my life during this time. My doc. classifies this as clinical depression. So currently i am back on prozac and feel normal again. I realize that i may have to take it for a long time and i am perfectly fine with that."
