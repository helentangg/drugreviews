"I&#039;ve been taking 50 mg Pristiq in combination with 300 mg Wellbutrin for two weeks, and it&#039;s the best I&#039;ve tried.  This week I&#039;ve been able to handle family and work issues with a sense of hope and able to focus rather than anxiety/ worrying, and that&#039;s awesome.  I had been taking Prozac and Wellbutrin for years but felt it wasn&#039;t working.  I tried everything but other meds didn&#039;t work or had bad side effects.  This made me queasy at first, but my dr. had said that would get better, and it did.  I take it at night because in the morning, it makes me tired.  So don&#039;t give up!  There is hope.  Hang in there. "
