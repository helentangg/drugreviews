"I was prescribe this medicine to help me because I was gaining to much weight with the bupropion XL, this didn&rsquo;t do any good at all for me. I had the anxiety 3-4 times a week, you know, that feeling of something is going to happen and you feel like you have your heart in your throat. I did like that I felt strong emotionally, not depress at all, I wish I didn&rsquo;t feel that anxiety at all. Hope it works for everyone else."
