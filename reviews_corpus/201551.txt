"Anxiety spiraled out of control over just a month following 18 months of grief, job loss and moving. I couldn&#039;t leave the house and was prescribed Zoloft 12.5mg, the side effects were pretty bad (no appetite, trembles and night sweats) but within two weeks these side effects passed and I began returning back to my old self 6 weeks later. I slowly built up to 175mg over 6 months and stayed at that dose for 1 year. Now, two years later, I have almost forgotten about anxiety and have begun reducing very very slowly (about 12.5mg every couple of months). I&#039;m now taking 137.5mg and feel good, thank you Zoloft."
