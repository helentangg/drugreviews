"I have been taking Zoloft for about 2 weeks and notice a little difference. I&#039;m much happier, not so tired as usual. One day I had this urge just to go out and I get my hair cut, nails done and my tongue pierced. I have no idea where that came from. I felt very social and wanting to talk to people. Before I liked to stay in my room with the dark curtains and hope it will rain soon because I couldn&#039;t stand the sun. I also didn&#039;t want any company..just wanted to be left alone. It still comes and goes. I&#039;m pregnant so I&#039;m only on 25 mg but I know if I was taking a higher mg I would feel better."
