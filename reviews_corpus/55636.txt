"I am so very thankful for this medication. It has allowed me to get a handle back on my life. I have panic attack disorder, separation anxiety, depression, and generalized anxiety. I was prescribed the Effexor for my depression. I was so depressed that I wouldn&#039;t leave bed, I&#039;d have crying fits daily, everything would upset me, and I had suicidal thoughts. I take 150mg daily, as well as some other medications, and I can honestly say I am a huge fan. I haven&#039;t had any side effects, I don&#039;t go through withdraw if I don&#039;t take it the same time daily, it doesn&#039;t cause any serious problems. My only advice is to take it with food, like most medications. Although this drug works for me, it might not work for everyone."
