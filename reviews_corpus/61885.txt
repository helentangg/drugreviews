"I started citalopram 10 mg just a couple of days ago  for depression. Very pleased. I started to feel much better the very next day. I am  sleeping better than before. I am not as sad, or frustrated. I&#039;m not crying every day. The best part is that I really haven&#039;t experienced any bad side effects at all. I actually think is also helping  my IBS too. I strongly recommend this medication. I was hesitant to try it because I was afraid of possible side effects. I am a female. I am 62 years old, but I am very active and like to stay active. Every person is different and reacts different to medications. I think it&#039;s worth the try!!!!"
