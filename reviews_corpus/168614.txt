"5 years on Viibryd 40mg and starting to feel REALLY BAD.  I take it for General anxiety disorder with ADAH .  I started getting Head dropping sensation at night. Started beta blockers for how bad hand tremors were/are. Absolute fatigue to the point of calling it lethargic from the time I wake up to the time I go to bed. Every task feels like a chore, not from unwillingness but due to complete lack of strength to do so. This week the deep bone and muscle aches have started. I feel so bad and has been gradual decline over last year. Just figured out the cause and I am sad to stop this medication, but I&#039;d rather have GAD then this."
