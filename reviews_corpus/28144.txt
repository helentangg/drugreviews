"Absolutely ineffective for my GAD....stuck with it for a year based on pdoc advice. Now I have to deal with tapering. What a mistake that has been. 

Additionally, I have tried several other ssri&#039;s as well as a few ssri&#039;s all to no avail. Suicidal thoughts, intolerable side effects, lack of any efficacy.  

Without Benzodiazepan&#039;s I would not be here now."
