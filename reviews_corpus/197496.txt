"I was taking 40mg per day and it worked great for about 9 years then my system got immune to it. I had terrible panic attacks and after 2 weeks they completely stopped and I have not had one since. I recommend it for anyone suffering from panic attacks or anxiety. Experienced no bad side effects whatsoever other than weight gain."
