"I started taking Sertraline about a year and 3 month&#039;s ago for generalized anxiety disorder as well as  depression. At first my doctor started me on 25mg per day for a month. For the first week it helped with my overall anxiety throughout the day but I was still experiencing anxiety and panic attacks up to 6 times a day depending on circumstances. After the first week it started to be less and less helpful until by the last week of the month it stopped altogether. My doctor continued this pattern of uping the dose by 25mg a month and the pattern continued to follow as far as the helpfulness of this drug for me for the rest of the year. It should also be noted that it did little to nothing for my depression at any point."
