"When I first started this medicine I was dizzy, couldn&#039;t eat, shaking, nervous, sick, and much more. But after 2 weeks that all went away. I love this medicine I no longer suffer from depression or anxiety attack. The one thing I Dont like about this medicine is the irregular heartbeat. I Dont like that at all. But other than that this medicine is a miracle."
