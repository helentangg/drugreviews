"I&#039;m a 21 year old full-time college student dealing with a lot of stress and anxiety.  After a severe panic attack, my doctor prescribed me with Zoloft to help quell my anxiety.  He started me on a low dosage (50mg) and it helped out a little.  Then 2 weeks later he doubled my dosage.  This caused me to hit an all-time low.  I&#039;ve never been depressed in my life, until Zoloft.  It caused me to be miserable, anti-social and alienate myself from the world.  Everyone&#039;s body reacts differently to medications, but if you feel like Zoloft&#039;s making you depressed stop taking it.  It can be a nightmare if you don&#039;t react well to it!  After 3 days off Zoloft I felt exponentially better."
