"It&#039;s not a bad medicine; works wonderfully for many others, but not so much for me. Effexor XR gave me some energy and got rid of my insomnia. That&#039;s about it. I think if I was on another medication, I would have more energy than Effexor has to offer. It worked better the third and forth week of taking it."
