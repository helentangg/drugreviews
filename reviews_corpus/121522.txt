"I&#039;ve been on Effexor for about 3 years now. I started at 75mg/day and am now at 37.5mg/day. Even at this dose, for me, it has drastically reduced the obsessive tendencies I had before. I very rarely have spiralling down obsessive periods now. I really dislike being on meds, but have resigned myself to being on Effexor the rest of my life. It has improved the overall quality of my life quite a bit. The only side effect I&#039;ve noticed is if I miss taking the dosage at the same time every single day. If I&#039;m off even by a few hours, I start to get the previously mentioned &quot;brain zaps&quot; which feel very odd. It feels like my brain goes through a warp of some type for a moment or two here and there. Once I have one, I realize I haven&#039;t taken my dose."
