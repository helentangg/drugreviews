"Was put on citalopram 12years ago for depression and anxiety, it changed my life. After an illness that brought all this on 20mg citalopram worked very well, I felt great and able to cope with whatever life threw at me. I still had mild depression when I overdone things but a slight increase sorted that out at around the 4 week mark. Unfortunately my recent depressive episode was severe and the dr I saw messed the dosage so much it seemed to stop working. I&#039;m sure it would have come through for me eventually but I was switched to lexapro so I&#039;m hoping this works as well as citalopram has in the past."
