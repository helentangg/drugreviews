"I suffered lower back pain for 15 years and finally my &quot;Pain Specialist&quot; gave me a prescription for a starter of Nortriptyline.  1 week 10mg, 1 week 20mg, 1 week 30mg, 1 week of 40mg and 1 week of 50 mg and the pain was gone.  It made me very hyper, but I was out of pain and happy.  I was on it for 6 months and a change in insurance forced me to taper back off.  Basically the starter in reverse.  As each week ended I kept wondering when the pain would come back. It was amazing because it never did come back.  I had lost some weight and built up my core muscles, so that helped. After 15 years of daily pain, the kind that makes you think oh no when someone invites you anywhere, I have been pain free for over a year."
