"This medicine changed my life. I&#039;ve suffered from social anxiety for 20 years and always afraid to ask for help,  until one wedding anniversary with my husband at a restaurant was to much for me. I was uncomfortable and major anxiety just eating in a restaurant and I was tired of feeling like this. The next day I told my doctor I needed help, he gave me lexapro and my life has changed. I&#039;m loving life again and nothing is holding me back. I&#039;m so grateful I asked for help"
