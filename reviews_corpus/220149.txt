"I&#039;m 20 years old and have both fibromyalgia and rheumatoid arthritis. I also use amitriptyline to treat my depression and my sleep. Before my rheumatologist prescribed this, I went through numerous other things which all caused me to get horrible headaches, stomach problems, and did nothing for my depression. 

I sleep well pretty much every night and I dont wake up feeling groggy, I dont have as many &#039;bad body days&#039; anymore, and I feel way better emotionally."
