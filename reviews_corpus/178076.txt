"I have been on Cymbalta for 5   years for disc herniation and depression. I did have sexual dysfunction but it passes. I have had LITTLE pain in my back since! It is a WONDERFUL medicine but high blood pressure does come with the medicine and dizzy spells for sometime until your body is adjusted to it. My dose is 60MG and I started at 30mg. I definitely love this medicine!"
