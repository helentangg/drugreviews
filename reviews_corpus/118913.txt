"GIVE IT TWO FULL MONTHS. That&#039;s my most important piece of advice. I am a 21 year old male and had an extremely acute outbreak of anxiety and panic attacks, mostly related to my health/getting a serious disease. My psychiatrist gave me 50mg of Zoloft a day   0.5 mg of Ativan. The Ativan worked immediately and for a long time I didn&#039;t think the Zoloft was working. But it&#039;s been two months now and I&#039;m almost anxiety free. Getting off the Ativan has been no problem at all (something I was very worried about) and I feel back to my old self pre-anxiety outbreak. 

My psychiatrist does therapy too, which I think was very very helpful."
