"It was great at first for my GAD.  I have never been able to concentrate so well. Unfortunately, it completely eliminated my personality.  I didn&#039;t get upset or excited about anything.  I eventually went off of it after my desire for sex had been completely eliminated.  My ability to become aroused returned within a few weeks.  Fortunately, I did not have any withdrawal symptoms when I stopped taking it."
