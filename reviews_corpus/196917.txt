"I was having panic attacks all the time which morphed into a stressful state of depression. Yes, I was falling apart. I&#039;d also lost a lot of weight, no appetite. I started on 20mg but wow, this stuff is strong!  My pupils became super dilated, I looked like I was on mdma.  I moved down to 10mg for a while then worked my way up to 20mg, then back down to 10mg.  I got almost every side effect in the book: constipation, bizarre dreams, sedation, sexual side effects, sleeping ten hours a night, then taking two hour naps late in the day.  BUT, the panic stopped!  Wow, for the first time in my life I could go to movie theaters, and restaurants with no panic attacks. Gained weight back, it was great. Finally quit when my life was back in order."
