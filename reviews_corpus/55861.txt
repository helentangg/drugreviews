"WARNING: Discontinuation Syndrome is the WORST I have ever experienced. I previously took a max dose of Zoloft and it took 6 months to titrate off the medicine. I have taken 37.5 mgs of Effexor the minimum dose (see my review under Depression) for 6 weeks and I have switched medicines and am still suffering daily &quot;brain zaps&quot;. My doctor&#039;s concern is significant enough to re-prescribe Effexor to rid me of the residual withdrawal symptoms. "
