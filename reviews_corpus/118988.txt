"I started using this about 5 weeks ago.  I noticed the difference in the way I felt within a day or two.  I was able to focus and concentrate again!  I&#039;ve gotten even better as the weeks have gone by.  I was still feeling very tired after three weeks so my Doctor added Wellbutrin with the Zoloft and now I feel great!  Zoloft works...in some cases you may need an additional medicine, not always."
