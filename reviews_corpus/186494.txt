"I suffer from anxiety, depression and panic attacks. 9/10 because its working for me but it&#039;s only the second anti-depressant I&#039;ve used. I was prescribed Cymbalta but had terribble nausea, body tremors, hot flashes and panic attacks.  With Pristiq I had nausea for three days but it was bearable and I was really restless. I had so much energy I walked around the block 3 times a day or more in the first week. It did stir up my depression and I had suicidal thoughts which is quite controversial because I never want to die and know in myself I would never do that to my girlfriend and my family I had insomnia the on the second night after starting my Pristiq but have had no insomnia ever since. All my side effects were gone after a week and then I was given a prescription for it. Life changing stuff."
