"I was prescribed Effexor for menopause symptoms and it treated my undiagnosed depression! It completely changed my life. I was an angry, laughing/crying mess and Effexor turned me around and put me in a good place with an excellent attitude. Cons are brain zaps and sweating from the forehead. I was weaning off of it when I couldn&#039;t take it anymore and went back on it. I started crying and felt horrible. Night sweats were miserable too. I&#039;ll take the zaps and sweats over depression and night sweats any day."
