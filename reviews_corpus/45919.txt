"Well I just started taking Prozac to help me deal with depression and anxiety.  I returned from from a tour in Iraq about three months ago and my symptoms kept getting worse and worse.  I&#039;ve been taking Prozac for about a week now and I&#039;m already feeling relief from it. It&#039;s like all the problems are still there, they just dont get to me like they used to. It&#039;s been very helpful so far."
