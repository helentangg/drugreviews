"This has made such a difference to my life. It is like the &quot;voice&quot; that continues to tell me I am too fat and that all the &quot;bad&quot; things in life would be better if only I were thinner, has weakened. It is still there but I don&#039;t have to listen, if fact I can even ignore it. What a relief. It has made me realize just how much time I was spending listening to all the negative thoughts, planning the food, covering up the vomiting. I finally feel &quot;normal&quot; what a relief."
