"I&#039;ve been on Zoloft 50mg for over two years. I am a more relaxed and easy-going person because of Zoloft.  Prior to starting the medicine, I was anxious all the time, worried constantly about everything, and suffered periods of depression and hopelessness.  Now I am a better wife, friend, and person in general."
