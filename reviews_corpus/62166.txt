"Best anti-anxiety medication for me.  At 20mg it perfectly takes the edge off &amp; allows me to focus with clarity at work &amp; at home.  I have been on Celexa for 10 years, tried Wellbutrin once thinking it might help with weight loss but it made me feel crazy &amp; irritable, I did not like it at all.   My daughter has similar issues as I do &amp; Celexa did not work for her, she&#039;s going to try Prozac now.  I think it&#039;s important to realize that everybody is different as is their chemical make up &amp; what might work great for one may not for another."
