"23/F I was diagnosed with GAD a few months ago and started on generic lexapro, first 5mg/day then up to 10mg/day. It took a few weeks to take effect, but it was incredible at counteracting the anxiety. My self-confidence increased and panic attacks went away completely. The reason I give it a 6/10 and the reason I came off it, however, is because of the sexual side effects. It took away my ability to orgasm, which was extremely frustrating for me. I&#039;m working with my doctor to find a different med to treat my anxiety without the sexual side effects of SSRIs."
