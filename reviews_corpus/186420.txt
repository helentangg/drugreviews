"17 months of use.  Good overall experience.  First 6 months outstanding. Lost weight, gym almost every day, active.  After about 12 months, anxiety and lethargy reappeared on occasion, then more prevalent past couple of months. Doctor said to double up for a few days, and that seems to help (2x50 mg). As in most medicines of this type, effectiveness can diminish with time.  Side effects minimal, lightheaded in the morning, need Cialis at times, sometimes not.  After 2 years of Effexor XR, this related medicine has been a welcome relief from the Effexor side effects."
