"Incredible medicine. Took maybe 4-6 weeks to kick in though, but when it did, WOW. I was having a panic attack every morning and was relying on a benzodiazepine to live a normal life. 

During the best of times, it has completely muted my anxiety. Sometimes I still get slightly anxious, but it&#039;s like the volume is turned way down. Have had maybe one &quot;panic attack&quot; (if I can even call it that, it was so mild) since it kicked in. 

I&#039;m happier, calmer, and more balanced. Only side effect was slightly disturbed sleep for 2 days when I started (and for a day or two after I increased the dose), and increased anxiety on the first day. I&#039;m on 15mg and I couldn&#039;t be happier."
