"Citalopram is the only anti depressant that has ever worked for me. I&#039;m in my 30s and have been dealing with depression since teenage years. Have tried several meds, but this is the only one that consistently works with no sexual side effects. On other meds I just wasn&#039;t interested in sex at all.. not normal for a guy and really bums you and your girl out. It&#039;s mild, probably not for someone dealing with severe depression. But i&#039;ll say I tried to stop once and noticed a difference right away, got right back on it. Takes the edge off the depression and helps me think clearer."
