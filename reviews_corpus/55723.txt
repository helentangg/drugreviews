"I wanted to be happy and better liked all around.   Well, depression subsided, was able to apply for jobs, handled my father&#039;s death better than I should have (numb.)  Landed a job with the post office,  thought Effexor was sent from the heavens.  Wrong!   Gave me severe blurred vision.  I first thought that maybe I needed new glasses.  So, I told myself I&#039;d make that my first priority when I get my first check from the post office.   Well, I was hired for a job that requires driving.   Needless to say, I lost my job immediately after I had gotten the job due to unable to see things (curbs, street signs, license plates)  clearly.  Been off for over a month, and vision remains blurred.  Have reapplied at PO, no call backs."
