"I&#039;ve been a chronic migraine sufferer my entire life. Literally, I even had migraines as a young child, which my neurologist informed me was very rare?.. I was diagnosed with chronic complicated migraine averaging 20 plus headache days a month. id get migraine attacks where I&#039;d repeatedly get slammed with migraines lasting up to 15 days where I couldn&#039;t function in a row. She put me on verapramil twice a day which helped slightly for a few months then did nothing so she put me on the amitriptyline a few days ago. I started at 25 mg at night and in a few days up to 50mg. It does help me sleep.. and my migraines today are substantially less. Hoping it keeps getting better!"
