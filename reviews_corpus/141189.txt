"Taking 20 mg of Lexapro. Before I started I was a complete mess for almost 3 weeks out of a month for the past 1.5 years. PMDD seemingly came out of no where and turned my life upside down. I ended up seeing a therapist which worked for a while but ultimately my suicidal ideation was scaring me and my overall quality of life was rapidly diminishing.  I went to a psychiatrist who prescribed 20 mg. After 4 days I felt better than I had in almost two years. Not high or euphoric but like myself. Like me. Alive. Happy. Present. 
The first 3 days I did feel kind of out of it. Spacey sort of. And a slight headache which was more annoying than debilitating. But that went away. 
Also I do experiencing a delayed orgasm. Hopefully it goes away."
