"I am 19 years old. I was diagnosed with depression/OCD/GAD at 11 years. This medicine worked wonders for me. I took it for 3 years. I later began to think I&#039;d be okay without it. Now that I am back on Effexor, it makes me really sick every time I take it. It made me put on a few pounds. I have taken almost every anti-depressant out there, and I have to say this is the best one. Stay on it, even when you feel better."
