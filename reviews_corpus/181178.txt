"This medication was a game-changer for me.  I&#039;ve suffered from anxiety/OCD/depression my whole life, and for the first time it feels like I can handle what life throws at me.  My anxious/intrusive thoughts still come, but they no longer ruin days/weeks/months.  I was very nervous to start this medication because of reviews about side-effects, but I honesty believe that most people who come on these sites to write reviews are the exceptions who have bad reactions.  The worst side effect I had was losing a little weight, while the best thing it did for me was probably saving my life."
