"I suffer with post traumatic stress disorder from years of trauma and then the death of my mother really was the icing on the cake. I&#039;ve also been dealing with physical ailments in the past 7 years, and panic attacks since I could remember. With all this going on, it&#039;s no wonder that I&#039;ve became depressed and anxious about life. I am not the type of person who believes in medication without trying alternatives first. In the past I&#039;ve tried other antidepressants to no avail. Was off of them for a year, but decided to go back on, trying Zoloft this time, when I became suicidal. That was the LAST straw. Been on 50mg for about a month, but started on 25mg a month prior. It LITERALLY saved my life. Don&#039;t give up! What one medication won&#039;t do for you another will."
