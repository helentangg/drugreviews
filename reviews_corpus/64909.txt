"Has helped enough that I still take it. A word of warning though, you may experience incontinence soon after (that lovely &#039;d&#039; word). In my case, it only takes about 5 minutes before nature comes calling (!)
Up until recently, I attributed it to the coffee I have every morning with my breakfast, as caffeine is apparently a common cause. 
Then I spoke to a friend who&#039;d stopped taking Zoloft because of this side effect and it suddenly dawned on me. So I tested it. Had my usual breakfast &amp; coffee, this time without the meds. 1/2 hour went by, no complaints down below. Took the Zoloft and sure enough, 4 or 5 minutes later, off to the the toilet again.
It&#039;s not a huge problem for me since it&#039;s predictable, only happens in the morning, and the drug does help depression-wise 
but some people may not feel the same way (no pun intended). 
Interestingly, I take the same dose again in the evening with no side-effect, so I suspect the morning combination with coffee may play a part."
