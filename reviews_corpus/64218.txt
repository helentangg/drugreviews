"I was suffering from acute anxiety in addition to my psychotic disorder(from illicit drug use) I would get this anxiety all day long and I couldn&#039;t take it any more so I spoke to my doctor and he put me on Zoloft 25mg. Its a tiny pill but it has made a huge difference in my anxiety level. I also practice meditation every morning to augment the Zoloft and that&#039;s definitely helped too. For those that want to know I practice observational meditation( simply observe and note changes in how I&#039;m feeling and attempt to silence the negativity). The only reason that I didn&#039;t give this medication a 10 was because of the sexual side effects. I have no sex drive and have extreme difficulty climaxing as well as maintaining an erection."
