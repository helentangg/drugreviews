"I have been on Effexor XR for 7 years now and it&#039;s awesome! I briefly went off it for awhile and it does have bad side effects when you are taken off of it so it&#039;s best to wean off slowly. I got back on it and it&#039;s really the best out of a lot antidepressants that I have tried.  I can tell if I miss a dose, my moods are more irritable and I get down easier. It has helped me with social anxiety. No bad side effects."
