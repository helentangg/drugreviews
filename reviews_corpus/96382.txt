"Had to start out with a very low dose 12.5 and work my way up to a 150 MG.  Would up dose by 12.5 each week.  Been on it for three months and have lost 15 pounds, also my hands shake and I can&#039;t sleep at night.  Also had bad stomach pain. Only been on the 150 mg since Nov. 27th. My doctor said to give it two more months.  So far have not gotten results yet with my anxiety or depression but it can take up to six months for some of these meds to start working.  Will just have to be patient and give it more time to work.  Will try Prozac if Zoloft doesn&#039;t work. My doctor said Prozac is the easiest one to get off of. Have read some good reviews on it and have tried two other ones before Zoloft so I&#039;m hoping this one starts to kick in soon."
