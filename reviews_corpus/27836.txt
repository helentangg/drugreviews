"Supposed to be 6 weeks to take effect. I felt instantly calmer, happen the NEXT day! Couldn&#039;t believe it. Started at 10mg moved to 20 MG in year of use. My problem now is  its been 7 years of working for me but 20mg doesn&#039;t have same effect of earlier years. I want to have  increase in MG use. How to I get doctor to do this?"
