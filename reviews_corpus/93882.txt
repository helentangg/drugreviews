"The medication worked well for 6 months with no sexual side effects. However, after that, I have noticed that Trintellix not effective as used to be and I dealt with low libido. Once I stopped the medication, my sexual desire was back.  Overall, the medication deserves a trial especially if your insurance covers it. Good luck every one."
