"My dr finally decided to try a different medication after I started telling him that I think I am bipolar, he put me on Cymbalta. It is good. A lot better then Prozac which I didn&#039;t feel any difference. I am taking 30 mg right now, think I could use an increase. Glad to hear all the good reviews about it! I think it is something I would like to stick too. "
