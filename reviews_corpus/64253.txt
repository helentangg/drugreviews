"I started taking 50 mg. Zoloft on Nov. 3 of this year (2016). After two days, I broke the tablet in half and felt much better.  I have taken 25 mg. every morning since Nov. 5. Aside from a couple of episodes of anxiety and anger, I have felt much better. I believe the Zoloft is working. I had serious road rage, and I would explode in anger at home. I tried very hard to hold my anger inside me until I was alone. Then I would scream and carry on like a maniac for a few minutes. Then I would cry in helplessness and shame for a few minutes.  Finally, I talked to my internist, and she suggested Zoloft. I am very grateful that this medicine is working for me. 
I am calmer and nicer; I  much more patient than I was prior to mid-November."
