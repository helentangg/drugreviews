"Marplan did an amazing job of keeping my depression away from 2010 through 2017.  I&#039;d tried Nardil &amp; Parnate prior but had weight gain/hypomania w/ Nardil and ridiculously high blood pressure after each dose of Parnate.  Marplan is sometimes said to be Nardil&#039;s weak little sister (as it&#039;s also derived from Hydrazine unlike Parnate which is derived from Amphetimine).  It worked great for me.  No weight gain, was able to perform sexually, and it kept me in a good place.  Marplan always felt very clean, I never had a hypertensive issue, but it did the trick.  The cost though (LOOKING AT YOU VALIDUS) is robbery.  Current insurance $160/month - Jan 1st insurance won&#039;t cover so $1500 a month.  Nope."
