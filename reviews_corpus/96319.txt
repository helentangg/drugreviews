"Been on Zoloft for about 2 months for panic disorder. Taking 100mg a day I can see a noticeable difference. I feel more at ease, and I almost never panic like I used to. Friends have said that I am more social, and I&#039;m more like the &#039;me&#039; of years ago before stress and anxiety started to run my life. Like all anti-depressants, the first 2 weeks were a little rough, but my doctor gave me a prescription of Klonopin which helped.

Like all SSRI, find the one that works for you. I was on Paxil for several months and was a mess. Horrible mood swings which my friends described as &#039;very manic depressive&#039;, which is something that I never had a problem with. Zoloft seems to work fine for me."
