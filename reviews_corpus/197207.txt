"I have been on Paxil now for 10 months, I am on a high dose 40mg.  However it is working wonders for me.  I love how I feel, and my anxiety is a lot lower than it use to be, and I feel like I can operate in a normal fashion be it at work or out in a social situation.  

The draw back, is do not run out of your prescription, always be on top of it.  I ran out of it, and the withdrawal side effects are not fun, for me I got really depressed and crying, and the headaches are horrible.   I realize I will be on this prescription for a very long time.  But for those who may not be, make sure you listen to your Dr. when getting off of it.  It is not fun when not in your system.   

Again, Love love how I feel.."
