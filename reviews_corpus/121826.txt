"I was taking Celexa for 2 years for my depression. It was not working well enough for me. I managed to just live life day by day, and roll with the punches. I suffer extreme anxiety disorder and extreme panic attacks up to 8 times a day. Several caused me to call 911 thinking I was having a heart attack. With all this said, my GP and I talked about changing my medication. I had heard of Effexor, I researched it, and thought why not! I felt that life WOULD NOT get any better then what I was living at that moment. 2 weeks after Effexor and some major hot flashes, I was looking at things different. I actually feel really good and hopeful. Now my smile is not fake and the anxiety has subsided to a minimal. No panic attacks. I am happy!"
