"I was very depressed for at least 8 years. After barely being able to do my basic mom duties, I decided to get help. My GP suggested Lexapro and I haven&#039;t looked back in 2 years. My overall mood and outlook on life have dramatically improved and now, not every little mishap sends me to bed for days on end. I still have struggles as we all do, but this medicine has really been like the hand of God touching my life. Please don&#039;t wait as long as I did to change your life and get back to your wonderfully made self!"
