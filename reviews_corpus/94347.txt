"I don&#039;t know how to rate this drug. I have tried almost every antidepressant available since 1991, and this is the only one that truly worked. My life improved in all ways since I started it approx 4 months ago. When I raised my dose from 10mg to 20mg I had tachycardia, blood pressure changes, shaking episodes, so went back down to 10mg. Weeks later developed severe back pain spreading to all joints so now I can barely walk, just agonizing pain all of the time. I am so disappointed, I was absolutely in love with this drug."
