"I have been on Viibryd for about 8 months now. In the past, I have been on Zoloft, Effexor, and Pristiq. The Pristiq seemed to work okay for a while, then it seemed to slowly stop working, so my psychiatrist recommended trying Viibryd since it has an added built-in benefit similar to Abilify&#039;s low-dose impact when administered with an anti-depressant. I think the worst part about changing medications is coming off of older antidepressants. With Viibryd, the added &quot;spark&quot; appeared during week 2 (20 mg). I have never felt better in my life. Anxiety ran high for the first couple of weeks, but that was the only side-effect and it was short-lived. Additionally, zero sexual side effects."
