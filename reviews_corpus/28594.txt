"I have to say that Lexapro has been a God send for me. I have been taking it for about 2 years now and life is as it should be. There aren&#039;t the crazy ups and downs. Everything seems to be more even keeled but you still have and feel emotions. Although, the first month or so I felt a little &quot;wired&quot; detached or something but better. Once you get past that it&#039;s like you finally feel like yourself and so relieved. I especially have noticed a difference around holidays or birthdays. I used to get so depressed around those times, not anymore. I also have noticed a big difference with anxieties. I used to sweat and feel lightheaded if people whom I didn&#039;t know talked to me and I didn&#039;t have someone who I was comfortable with around, not anymore."
