"I have been on Cymbalta for about 2 months and I must say it is working pretty good for me.  I feel &quot;normal&quot; - no extreme ups or downs.  I don&#039;t feel &quot;zombied out&quot; as with some other medications.  I used to have really bad night sweats, but that is over now.  I noticed that I eat much, much less than I used to.  But this is good for me becuase when I was on Seroquil and Lexapro I gained a lot of weight that I am now trying to lose. So overall, this has been a good medicine for me.  I would encourage anyone to at least give it a try.  The only real drawback at this point is the $35 copay since it is not on my insurance plans preferred drug list."
