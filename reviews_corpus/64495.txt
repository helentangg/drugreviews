"Thank you guys for posting your experiences on here. I have been suffering with anxiety out of no where for the last couple months. It wakes me up everyday and I have a hard time sleeping. It&#039;s been so bad that I literally was so sick I was vomiting for a week. I struggled with the idea of taking medicine out of fear of being dependent on it. After reading everyone&#039;s experiences on here I got up the courage to try it. It&#039;s crazy but I started taking it 2 days ago and I feel a sense of hope like there just might be another side to it and I will feel like myself again. Thank you"
