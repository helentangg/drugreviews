"I started taking Lexapro in April this year for anxiety/OCD and it did help a lot and I was able to function again. The two main side effects were weird vivid dreams and I have gained about 20 lbs which I cannot stand so I&#039;m now weaning myself off.  I&#039;ve been off for about 1 week and my mood has been so up and down. Very irritable. Also, have been having the weird brain zaps but now they are wearing off after about a week."
