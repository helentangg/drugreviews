"I was first put on wellbutrin at 300mg then 450mg but that kept me up and I really wasn&#039;t feeling much of a difference. The doctor added Prozac 20mg. For the first 3 days I could sleep. After that if feels like I&#039;m coming off a caffeine high as I get very tired but I never experience a high in energy. I get hot flashes and sweat about 25-30mins after taking it but then it goes away. I yawn all the time. Another thing I&#039;ve noticed since I&#039;ve been on it was decreased sexual mood and ejaculation feels weird, just weird. I&#039;m not emotionless but sadness, depression and anger seem to not be present. Decreased appetite and lost a little weight. No other side effects experience."
