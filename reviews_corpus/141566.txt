"Lexapro saved my life pure and simple. I was 42 years old and worked many years in the financial industry. One night before I went to bed right after X-mas, I had a severe panic attack and for three months I suffered unbelievably. I tried dieting, meditation, vitamins, exercise, you name it. Nothing worked. I first tried Zoloft but the side effects were awful. Next I tried Lexapro. Side effects were bad for 2 weeks and then after a month, anxiety reduced by 80%. Still have some but 100% better than before. Another key is to meditate, eat right, exercise and connect spiritually. Lexapro for the brain and meditation for the soul!"
