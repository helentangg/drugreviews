"I&#039;m 34 yrs old, military for 10 years as a grunt so automatically pain in every joint possible.   I&#039;ve also had two serious incidents in combat and two vehicle accidents in the states.  I have been on everything I think, no help so far and recently 3 months ago put on stepped into nortriptolyne 50 mg along with  gabapentin.  I must say I&#039;m a bit better as I&#039;m not on bed rest as I used to not be able to get up.  I have also been forced to carry a Tens unit which helps with spasms along with Robaxin and at times have to take Norco when it gets bad.   I&#039;m hoping for the best and hoping to just be on one pill or none soon.  Oh, and therapy weekly. So far I can only say : I think nortriptyline helps."
