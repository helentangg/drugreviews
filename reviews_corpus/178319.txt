"After a few years on SSRI&#039;s with recurring switches to hypomania I was put on Cymbalta   Lithium. First there was a great antidepressant effect, but soon after I was told to raise the dose, I switched into a period of mania, making me aggressive. Since two years I don&#039;t take any antidepressants and have not been hypomanic/manic a single time."
