"My doctor prescribed citalopram 20 mg for me a while back for depression. When on the medicine I find that it helps me more with my anxiety than it does for depression. I really don&#039;t like its side effects. I find that I can&#039;t sleep as well as I did before I started taking citalopram. I get bad headaches and can not perform sexually."
