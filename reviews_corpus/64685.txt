"mixed review.
at first I noticed a change in my thinking- was able to enjoy moments more- less clouded by suicidal/depressive thoughts.

However after my therapist suggests we up the does to 100mg a day, things went back to usual after about 3 weeks - same fatigued, depressed state of mind - no motivation or drive to live - disassociation issues...etc.

This does not mean it  may not work for others - I have a history of my body becoming &#039;accustomed&#039; to most prescribed drugs, thus my body no longer responds to them after long term consumption (even if meds are made to treat chronic problems). So if you&#039;re lucky enough to have a body that is consistent with drugs, I do recommend sertraline. It definitely made a change for me even for only 3 weeks"
