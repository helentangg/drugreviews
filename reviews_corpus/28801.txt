"My young daughter suffers from Tourette Syndrome, OCD and Anxiety. The Anxiety is a recent thing. She has never been treated before for her tics (TS) or OCD (which actually is relatively new as well). They started her on Lexapro and her anxiety was heightened as well as decreasing her appetite. Which is not good since her obsession is NOT throwing up from food. So for her, this medicine did not work. She also complained of being tired, more nausea than usual, etc. She wasn&#039;t on it long either. We just made the decision that we could not afford her to be worse. She is now on something else - fingers crossed that it&#039;ll work!"
