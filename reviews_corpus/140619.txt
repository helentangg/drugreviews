"Before I started taking Lexapro I would be anxious constantly and it the anxiety interfered with my daily life. I would avoid events, people, and responsibilities, now I don&#039;t do that anymore. I&#039;m generally happier and functioning better in life. I also found that my anxiety opened the door to depression, now thats gone too. It took 2 months to kick in

Side effects: good news is I didn&#039;t gain weight on it. My biggest complaint was that it totally killed my sex drive and made it virtually impossible to orgasm, HOWEVER I found out that taking it at night instead of in the morning brought my sex drive back :) I also feel a bit numb emotionally but it&#039;s so worth it

I still take .25-.5 mg Clonzepam a few times a week if anxiety flares up"
