"To make a long story short, I have been battling anxiety and panic attacks for almost ten years. Took many different meds then was put on Lexapro. After a year stopped taking it and went on Zoloft. BIG MISTAKE. Started back on 10 mg two days ago, not having as much anxiety or panic. Just in the mornings waking up feeling anxious. Hopefully this will stop soon. My kids need me to feel better soon."
