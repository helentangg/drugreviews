"This medicine worked extremely well to treat my anxiety disorder. It did not take long for the medicine to help me control the problems I was experiencing. I used 20mgs for about 4 and half years. The only thing that prevents this treatment from receiving a higher score are the side effects and withdrawal symptoms. The side effects I experienced were a definite decrease in sexual desire and a weight gain in my mid section. Personally I don&#039;t feel that any drug treatment is a permanent option, so when I decided to wean off of the drug I figured it would not have that great of an effect on me. Yet the withdrawal symptoms that I am currently experiencing are quite terrible. I am sure they will go away with time, but I could definitely do without."
