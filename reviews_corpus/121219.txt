"I have been on 75mg ER of Venlafaxine HCL for over 3 months now and I really feel wonderful.   It&#039;s working very well for me.  I have plenty of energy, lost about 20 pounds of weight and I do feel very content and calm.  I do have vivid dreams that are interesting and long.  I socialize and react very well with people now and no longer have any fears of socializing with groups of people.   Again, this antidepressant, has so far, worked very well with me and I am happy that my doctor switched me from 20mg of citalopram, which made me very tired and gain way to much weight,  to 75mg Effixor  ER (Venlafaxine).   Everyone&#039;s system is a bit different and what may work well for someone may not work well for someone else.  I wish you all the best."
