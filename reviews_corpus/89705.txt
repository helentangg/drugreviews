"I was put on Celexa about 6 months ago for anxiety attacks and a little bit of depression. After the loss of my Grandpa, I cried a lot and couldn&#039;t even go into Wal-mart alone because I would have an attack and leave the store empty handed. This medicine has done amazing things to me, I am calm, in a better mood, and overall I don&#039;t worry so much about the little things that I can not control in life. I had a few small side effects, but nothing that was more horrible then not leaving the house because you would have panic attacks. I had dry mouth the first couple of weeks but overall I feel amazing and recommend it highly to everyone. Just remember that people&#039;s bodies are different, and it might just not be the one for you."
