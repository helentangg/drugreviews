"I was experiencing severe anxiety and panic. I could barely leave my house and everyday activities seemed impossible. I would get dizzy, pounding heart, the works! Also, I couldn&#039;t sit still anymore! I could not sit in class, dinners, or even just with friends. My doctor prescribed Zoloft 25mg, a typically low dosage, after an unsuccessful attempt with Lexapro. I have been on Zoloft 25mg for six weeks now and I&#039;m doing tremendously better. The first two weeks or so I experienced minimal, tolerable side effects like foggy feeling the first day, heighten anxiety and restlessness, but nothing too bad. Now I feel great! I can sit for longer periods, little to no obsessive thoughts and am pretty much panic free! I love Zoloft!"
