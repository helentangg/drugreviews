"Hey Everyone! I am going to try and make my story short. I am 26 years old and did not know what anxiety or an anxiety attack was until I turned 25.  I was driving to lunch one day and for no reason at all it hit me. I felt as if I wasn&#039;t in control of my own body. I felt like I was going to pass out at the wheel, my heart began to race and my arms and legs went numb. I drove myself straight to the ER. The doc told me it was an anxiety attack. After that first attack I could not leave my house for two weeks in fear that I would pass out or lose control. I was then put on Lexapro, the first two weeks I felt the side affects..AFTER THAT A true BLESSING!! NO ANXIETY OR ATTACKS IN 2 WEEKS! I FEEL LIKE ME AGAIN!"
