"I&#039;ve been on Zoloft for 3 weeks (100mg) and it&#039;s done wonders for me.  I was always sad, uninterested in anything, quick tempered, very negative...you get the picture.  Within a week that changed.  I&#039;m able to laugh, I want to do things again; best of all, my sex drive is returning!  My appetite has lessened, but I&#039;m not complaining.  In the first week, I was taking Zoloft by itself; now I&#039;m taking Seroquel XR in the evening in conjunction.  I&#039;m sleeping like a baby the night through (first time in years, really!).  My family and friends are as glad as I am that I&#039;m now on the right track."
