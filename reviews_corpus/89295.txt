"I have a previous traumatic stroke 5 years ago. I have been maintained with blood thinners and 1mg ativan. Recently last month my anxiety and panic attacks are at all time high. They are daily and debilitating.. I fear of dying but have had numerous ER trips and Dr visits that always come back very healthy.. I have only been on celexa for 3 days.  Are anyone out there with similar background and positive experiences with this drug.
Thanks"
