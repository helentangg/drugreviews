"This drug -super small dose - has changed my life.  I have been a nurse for 26 years. My stress and anxiety levels were at the max!  I just wanted to sleep on my days off and I did not want to socialize.  I was easily overwhelmed and worried constantly.  I was just awful.   I started lexapro at 10 mg and it was too much !  I backed down to 5 mg and the first 3 weeks were hell.  I felt out of body - exhausted but could not sleep - it was just an awful three weeks.  After reading many reviews to hang in there --- that&#039;s what I did.  Around week 3-4 - I adjusted.  I felt like my worries rolled off my back, I wanted to do things, I felt more energy than I had in years, I was laughing and finally listening to people did not annoy me!  Hang in!!"
