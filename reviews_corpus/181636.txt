"I have been on Prozac 40 mg for 10 weeks now, I feel super great. I was taking Xanax too but I feel I don&#039;t need to take my Xanax any more. Prozac has been working for me just great! The first week I was feeling terrible anxiety, numbness in my face, dry mouth, fears. It was crazy but at day 9th I started to feel more focused, so now it&#039;s been 10 weeks and I feel how I used to feel before, just great. So please just hang in there, give Prozac at least 2 weeks to kick in."
