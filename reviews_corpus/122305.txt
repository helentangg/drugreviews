"Where has this medication been hiding? I&#039;ve suffered from depression for 18 years, having to change medicines every couple years and usually never feeling too good...just pulling myself through everyday. I&#039;ve been on Zoloft, Effexor, Prozac, Cymbalta with low dose Abilify and Wellbutrin. Finally a month ago a new Doctor suggested the EMSAM patch.  I feel like the darkness has been lifted.  I have energy, can concentrate and actually look forward to doing or planning things. Even the Adderall I had once taken to help increase my energy level didn&#039;t do what this patch is doing.  EMSAM has changed not only my life, but my family&#039;s as well."
