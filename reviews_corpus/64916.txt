"I thought I was too far gone. I have Pure O - every second of every single day was torture. I didn&#039;t want to live any more, I couldn&#039;t with the obsessive thoughts that were so antithetical to who I was. Constantly I would tell myself who I was but the OCD would always trick me out of my logic; but OCD has your whole imagination at its disposal.  I got a lot worse before I got better on Sertraline: REMEMBER WHO YOU ARE AND STICK IT OUT. One day you&#039;ll feel like you&#039;ve been punched and woken up from a bad dream. If I can do it when I was on the verge of suicide, you can too. I believe in you."
