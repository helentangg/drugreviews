"I went on Zoloft, 50mg, in December 2009.  About a month later I pushed it up to 100mg.  It has definitely helped my mood and also seems to help me to lose weight (which is a most wonderful thing for me). I also take lamotrogine.

I have been experiencing a clenched jaw and stiff shoulders though, but when I asked my psychiatrist about that today,  she said she had not heard of that happening with Zoloft before.

I don&#039;t sleep well,  but I have always been an insomniac.  My psychiatrist told me that Zoloft will not help me to sleep. "
