"I am taking Lexapro for depression and bulimia. The first week of taking Lexapro my doctor had me on 10mg. Didn&#039;t have any negative or positive side effects. I was then bumped up to 20mg. After taking one of the 20mg, the next day my vision was very blurry. It was also getting difficult for me to urinate. (Didn&#039;t hurt, but felt like I needed to go ALL the time) I talked to my doctor and she didn&#039;t think Lexapro had anything to do with my vision so went back down to 10mg for a week. No negative side effects so went back to 20mg (hoping my body got use to it). No blurry vision this time, but it was still difficult to urinate. The doctor had me get off of it and not even 3 days later I was back to &quot;normal&quot; when it came to using the restroom. Depression was better though. Bulimia..no effect."
