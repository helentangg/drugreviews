"I have atypical depression. I have tried Wellbutrin (allergic reaction), Zoloft (diarrhea, anxiety), Prozac (good experience), and Effexor, which made me crave alcohol everyday even though I generally dislike alcohol and am not a regular drinker. All of these gave me delayed ejaculation problems except for the Wellbutrin. I pretty much gave up on medicines until I had a major depressive bout and went back to the psychiatrist who suggested I give Viibryd a try. It has made everything so much better! No side effects, high energy and motivation, and has stabilized my usually volatile temper greatly. I&#039;ve read a lot of negative reviews out there so I was compelled to write this review because in my case, rare as it may be, Viibrys has worked."
