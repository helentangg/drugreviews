"I started taking 20 mg as I was taking 20 mg of Lexapro. At first I felt better than I did with Lexapro (after 15 years on Lexapro the side effects were to much) after about two weeks I started getting more migraine headaches than I was before also I was starting to get heart palpitations and these problems increased with time. The migraines got to the point I was having one daily. Viibryd also caused me to be impotent even when using Cialis, the migraines likely contributed to this. I told my doctor about these problems and he told me to stop taking it. I have taken many drugs and Viibryd is by far the worst drug I have ever taken. I don&#039;t think it is fit for consumption by anyone or anything. I took Viibryd for almost two months."
