"I started Effexor XR two weeks ago for generalized anxiety disorder. Apparently it takes at least 4 weeks to work but I have already noticed a difference. I have had very positive effects on my mood and anxiety problems.

There are definitely side effects though. I have had some trouble sleeping and my orgasms are very delayed and are very hard to reach. I have noticed however, that my sex drive has gone through the roof (which isn&#039;t a bad thing). 

Currently taking 75mg daily. Considering increasing but I am worried about increasing dependency and side effects.
