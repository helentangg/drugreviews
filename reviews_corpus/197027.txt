"Have been on Brisdelle for over 9 months for hot flashes, helped considerably.  I would be soaking wet, that doesn&#039;t happen anymore. Had to get new insurance, they won&#039;t cover Brisdelle but will  cover paxil so my Dr. has put me on 10 mg. So far so good, hot flashes are 3-5 daily but really very mild, maybe the extra 2.5 mg will help my mood. :)"
