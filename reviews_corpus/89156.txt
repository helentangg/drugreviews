"Citalopram  works great for me. I&#039;ve been on and off of it for about 5 years. When I was on it several years ago it was like night and day. I have major depression and general anxiety. When going back on it most recently (4 months ago), I started at 20mg for the first month. The first dose helped my anxiety immensely. Within a few weeks my depression lifted some. I&#039;m now on 40mg again and it is definitely helping, but I feel like in the past it worked better for the depression. So Today I&#039;ve started 5mg Abilify  in addition; hoping it will help some more."
