"Citalopram changed my life. I was severely depressed, crying every day with a hugely negative outlook. After just a few days I felt much more positive, less depressed and barely cry. Only side effects for me were mild nausea and a headache after taking the first few times, but eating something helps. Would definitely recommend citalopram!"
