"LOVE IT, my first day and I already feel better. I have tried every antidepressent out there, side effects were never a problem, they just didn&#039;t seem to help with the depression and when they did stop me from crying they stopped any type of feelings I was a zombie, and none of them helped with the motivation. Not to sure how Viibryd will do in that area but I have my hopes up. I hope it keeps working and I can afford it. For the first time in years I feel better."
