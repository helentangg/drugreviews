"I am a 30 year old male who has been on Lexapro for 2.5 years. I had been seeing a therapist for 2 or 3 years before I started taking it for my anxiety. I was extremely hesitant because I do not like taking medicenes but eventually gave in. It improved my disposition pretty quickly. My initial dosage was 10 mg. For the first couple of months i would get nausea an hour or so after taking, but then realize if i ate something just before or when I took it, I would not get the nausea. After the first few months, I do not get the nausea at all, even if I don&#039;t take it with food. I occasionally have had vivid dreams since I started taking it, but if anything I kinda think that is neat. After 6 months,  we upped my dosage to 20 mg. Works great."
