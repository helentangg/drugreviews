"A couple of weeks ago what I considered my  &quot;usual anxiety&quot; symptoms started getting worse and the doctor put me on Lexapro to calm my ever raging mood swings. I started out on 10 mg which threw me for a loop. I felt strange all the time, very fatigued but had insomnia, dry mouth, and felt emotionally numb. I almost quit taking it, but then decided to try something different. I don&#039;t know if I would recommend this for everyone, but I started taking 1/2 in the morning and 1/2 at night. I feel 100% better! I am very alert, sleep deeply, I don&#039;t have the mid afternoon slump, I am not as emotionally numb and I have so much energy."
