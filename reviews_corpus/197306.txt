"I first tried Paxil in 2003, after trying everything and I do mean every antidepressant on the market. I couldn&#039;t believe in less than a week I was already feeling relief. My mistake: I kept going on and off of it. It eventually stopped helping. So for 3 years I went on Celexa, which helped less than Paxil but more than others. Recently I began getting severe generalized anxiety dsorder along with my Depression. I finally decided to give the Paxil a try again since so much time had lapsed since I&#039;d been on it. Well...it worked again. Feeling better than I have in a long time. Message: Everybody is different so Paxil won&#039;t work for all. But if it does you..STAY ON IT. Don&#039;t try the on and off thing. Good Luck!"
