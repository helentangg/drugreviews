"This my third day on escitalopram for trichotillomania and anxiety. The first two days were rough, I had horrible mood swings, nausea, and loss of appetite. But today(the third day) I felt like a normal person after so long and I&#039;m glad I&#039;m starting to see somewhat of a result so soon. Although I still had loss of appetite and trouble sleeping I&#039;m starting to feel better and I love it."
