"Anxiety City update last comment 9 December, now its a month on 10 January think I&#039;m adjusting well on Lexapro but I&#039;m only on 5mg.  Seeing specialist regularly to get the right level not going up higher dose, as 5mg is good.  I feel no different just don&#039;t get so angry, stressed, manic, over whelmed still got some social anxiety to sort but the doctor didn&#039;t say it was a magic pill. I&#039;m managing a healthy diet and starting to work out again and alcoholic benders are now a bad memory as the Lexapro is helping me to not binge on food or drink only have couple of drinks with waters in between socially so all good.  Doing the best I can, always room for improvement being less critical within and hoping I&#039;ll adjust 100%."
