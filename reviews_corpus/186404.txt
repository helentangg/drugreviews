"This medicine is a miracle. I&#039;ve tried Prozac, Effexor and Wellbutrin. Since I&#039;ve been on Pristiq, I no longer feel sad and cry the way I used to! I&#039;m finally happy! I thank Pristiq for this! The sadness seems to creep back in however when I&#039;ve missed a dose, so its imperative that dosing remains consistent. I&#039;ve found taking it in the morning is best as it does cause sleeplessness. Other side effects I&#039;ve noticed are; constipation, loss of appetite and substantial weight loss. After reading a few reviews, I laughed as I read another Pristiq user describe how they now &quot;ramble on and on&quot; when talking to someone! I too, do the same thing! I so glad to know it may be a side effect of Pristiq! Take note my dear family! Perhaps I&#039;m really not a &quot;wingnut&quot; after-all."
