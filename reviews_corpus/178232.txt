"I have just started taking it, and I wanted to give a viewpoint from the beginning.  I have been on this for 4 days now.  The first day was really bad, but it is getting better.  My appetite is coming back now, and I am not snapping at my family like I was before I started Cymbalta.  I am still quite tired and nauseated during the day, and am still having some trouble sleeping.  Before this I used to drink a lot, and this has helped me lose the desire to drink, which in my case is a good thing.  I am going to stick with it and hopefully the rest of the side effects will go away slowly.  I already feel more positive and my family has even noticed a difference already."
