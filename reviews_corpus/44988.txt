"I have always had issues with anxiety, mild panic, and OCD, but it was manageable. I developed panic disorder in the fall and become reclusive and a hypochondriac because of the panic attacks. After a litany of tests that came back normal and time with physical and mental therapists (which both helped but did not completely cure the attacks), I caved and started fluoxetine 10mg. The first few weeks I was jittery, but that is the only side effect, and it went away. My panic subsided days in. I&#039;ve been on it for 2.5 months now and have been panic free for the last month. I&#039;ve also noticed a reduction in the amount of headaches I getâ€‹. I was TERRIFIED to give this drug a chance, but glad I did. I finally have my life back!"
