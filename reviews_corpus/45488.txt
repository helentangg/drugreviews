"Where do I begin....wow this medicine has really given me my life back! I truly felt like I was loosing my mind before I started taking this. I am in my late 30&#039;s, and for the past couple years I have tried several other medications for my severe mood swings (PMS). Being a mother of 3, with a husband, and working as a full time critical care nurse, I needed my life back!! My doctor said she had been going back to the &quot;old faithful&quot; Prozac for a lot of her patients. And boy am I glad I finally tried this one! I haven&#039;t had any of the crazy side effects I was scared of, and I feel calmer, happier, and not so socially awkward. I&#039;m only on 20mg, but I feel wonderful with this."
