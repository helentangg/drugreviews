"For a long time it seemed that everything I ate would cause my belly to swell so I looked pregnant. My constipation and belly pain also worsened significantly the last few years.  After a battery of testing it was determined that I had SIBO and IBS-C.  After treatment with the antibiotics, my bloat was better but not gone. Tried linzess for the constipation but I hated it.  Then doctor prescribed Amitiza for constipation and Amitriptine 25mg at night for bloat and pain. It has SAVED me. The pain is gone and the bloat is almost gone! Plus, the side effects work to my advantage. Don&#039;t get up to pee 4 times a night anymore and I have never slept better! Dry mouth is pretty bad but I will take that over the pain, any day."
