"I started at 10 mg at bedtime for pain in my lower back, the pain would go down both legs and was ruining my life- after a few weeks I was up to 60 mg and I am virtually pain free. I am sleeping great, too. The dry mouth usually comes for me after I up the dose, one thing though, I had a numb spot right above my right knee which is caused by a pinched nerve in my pelvic region- the numbness has turned to a fullness in my knee now...weird but I can live with it."
