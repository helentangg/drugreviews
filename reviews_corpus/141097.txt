"I used this page for support when I first started out on Lexapro so I thought I&#039;d give back. I was prescribed Lexapro 10mg for dysthymia (mild chronic depression) and anxiety. The first few weeks were accompanied by a persistent mild headache and some nausea. I was much more tired - slept 8-hour nights plus an afternoon nap. 10 days into my prescription I was at the beach and I noticed some people&#039;s swimsuits appeared to have brighter colours. The world slowly began to appear more vivid visually and to have more &quot;depth&quot;. At some point rumination stopped almost completely. Two months in, the world seems much more inviting and much less harsh than it used to. 
This drug works for me."
