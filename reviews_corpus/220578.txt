"I was diagnosed with Interstitial Cystitis about 10 years ago. At that time I was prescribed this at 25mg a day. I was going to the potty about 20 times a night.  I took the meds for about 2 weeks but could not handle the side effects of confusion and listlessness. I quit taking it for a long time and suffered with the frequent urination. I was at my wits end (no sleep!) and found the old pill bottle of amitriptyline in my drawer.  I am no longer working so I decided that I would give it another try since I didn&#039;t have a schedule to keep. Even though I&#039;m a little groggy in the mornings I am sleeping at least 6 hours straight without having to go to the bathroom.  I have gone from waking up approx. 20 times a night down to 2 times. It is a miracle."
