"After years of suffering I decided to try mess again for my PMDD.  Zoloft made me feel like a zombie and my body had many side effects to Prozac.  I had electric shocks in my brain, paranoia which I don&#039;t normally have, feeling out of it/forgetful, anxious, dry eyes, moody, thought people were plotting against me and my depression got worse.  On top of all that I went from being 5&#039; 11 and 155 pounds to weighing 195lb in ONE month without changing my eating habits!!  My doc convinced me to give it some time for the med to work so stayed on it for  3 months-wish I quit sooner. I have now been off of it since Feb but still feel slight effects of the Prozac. Eventually Wellbutrin ended up helping me tremendously so I have stayed on that."
