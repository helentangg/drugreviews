"Started on 10mg of Viibryd and have been taking it for over 6 weeks.
First week I experienced being &quot;spacey&quot;, diarrhea and no appetite.  After the first week, I started to feel better and have improved quite a bit.  Anxiety is gone but still have &quot;anger&quot; issues, although not as bad prior to Viibryd. 
Asking the doctor to up the dosage to 20mg to possible help with anger issues.
Otherwise, Viibryd is about the best anti-depressant I&#039;ve ever taken.  Much better than Wellbutrin/Zoloft/Prozac/Celexa/etc."
