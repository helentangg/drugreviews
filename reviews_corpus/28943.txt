"I guess Im one of the few who didn&#039;t see a difference in my depression while taking Lexapro. It did wonders for my anxiety attacks, but my depression never went away. Also, if you start taking Lexapro, please consult your doctor if you plan or need to stop for any reason. The withdrawal can be a little harsh."
