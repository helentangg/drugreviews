"Started with 20mg then after around 45 days increased to 40.
Dry mouth, fatigue, lightheadeness, increased anxiety, headaches, were common at first, however in time slowly decreased. I now have good day time energy, I&#039;m sleeping well at night. Confidence level is becoming stronger.
I pray the next few weeks at 40 mg takes me to were I want to be. So far, so good!"
