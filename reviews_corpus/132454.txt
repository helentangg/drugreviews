"Started on Doxepin 100mg January 2017 due to debilitating GAD and panic attacks. I was miserable. Ten minutes after waking up, the panic attacks would start. I quit going out in public as much as possible. At night, I couldn&#039;t shut my mind off, which exasperated my insomnia. I was taking more Xanax than prescribed to try to get through the day. I specifically asked my psych for this based on reviews. Helped right away with sleep (with no next day grogginess for me), and after about a week, started putting the brakes on my anxiety. Slowly noticed I was getting parts of my life back. It served its purpose and pretty darn well, but in ten months I gained 30lbs and kept gaining.  Due to the ongoing weight gain I switched to gabapentin instead."
