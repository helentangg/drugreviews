"I suffer from interstitial cystitis and have tried all the medications to keep the burning pain and heaviness in my bladder tolerable. I was given Amitriptylene first (5mg.) and I was like a zombie the entire next day. I tried it a few times to give it a chance but without any change. A specialist that I saw a couple of months suggested that I try Nortriptylene because even though it is in the same family as Amitriptylene sometimes it has a different effect. I have taken it for 4 nights now and have noticed a huge difference in the way my bladder feels. Spasms are gone and the heaviness and burning have gone as well. I haven&#039;t slept well since taking it but was having trouble sleeping through the night anyway. No day grogginess though."
