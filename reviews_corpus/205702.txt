"I really think this is a wonderful drug for depression if you don&#039;t have any severe side effects.  I, unfortunately, am experiencing a lot of jaw, face and eye pain.  I went to 5 doctors about it before my psychologist said it was the anti-depressant.  He gave me Klonopin, which made me moody, depressed and extremely self-conscious (not to mention sleepy).  I&#039;ve also had 3 anxiety attacks since taking the Klonopin.  So, I am weening myself off of both and am going back to the doctor in a week.  "
