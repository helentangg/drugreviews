"Effexor has worked at times for me for my panic disorder, but has not gotten rid of my panic attacks. I&#039;ve been tapering off it for months 150 to 37.5 ... Remember with Effexor almost everyone is going to suffer from discontinuation syndrome... or as many know it the &quot;zaps&quot;.  Effexor&#039;s lowest dose was 37.5 mg now they make a 25 mg to help. I understand that getting off it is possible, but the reason for the discontinuation syndrome is due to the short half life of the medicine. Prozac at a low dose around 10 mg does help because of its long half life.  "
