"I am diagnosed as having bipolar disorder 1 and for 13 years been suffering and have difficulty sleeping. If I did sleep I dozed for more than 12 hours and have no energy after my psych doc changed my antidepressant from Surmontil to fluoxetine. I just notice its immediate effects after 5 days. I have energy, my sleep was good. My thoughts are clear, I just hope that this effects would last as this medicine puts a smile on my face as having more motivation and being positive."
