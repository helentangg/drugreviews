"It works for me! I&#039;ve had chronic daily headaches, migraines, and neck pain for over 18 years.  Once diagnosed with migraines about four years ago, I was able to reduce the frequency and severity by avoiding known triggers (see Buchholz&#039;s &quot;Heal Your Headache&quot;) but recently the headaches recently returned in force. 

I convinced my doctor to let me try nortriptyline and it works very well with very mild side effects. I had dry mouth which is not very noticeable now, higher incidence of heartburn than normal, firmer stools, and frequent &quot;weird&quot;, vivid dreams. Relief started at 25 mg but I now take 75 mg daily. Migraine frequency is down from 20+ days a month to 1-2. I still avoid most triggers to be safe but this has helped tremendously"
