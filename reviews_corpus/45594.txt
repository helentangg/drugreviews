"I had mild ocd, mdd, stress, anxiety since childhood due to bad environment. Then I went on venlafaxine, nortriptyline. When I was on it, I did some terrible things like stealing without fear of getting caught, violent behavior, mind going blank, forgetfulness, apathy, sexual dysfunction. After 3 months I start to feel better mood wise."
