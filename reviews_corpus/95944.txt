"I started taking Zoloft October of 2011. Although it has helped me tremendously with anxiety, depression, and severe mood swings. It makes me very tired and withdrawn. And I&#039;ve gained 20 lbs since October 2011! I haven&#039;t seen a lot of reviews with this type of side effect for Zoloft, but I know I&#039;m not over eating to that degree.  3lbs I gained since my Dr visit last week. My Dr lowered the dosage by 1/2. But needless to say the weight gain is more depressing then anything."
