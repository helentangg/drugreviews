"I loved Lexapro, I had been on it for approximately 5 years.  It worked wonders, made me feel close to &quot;normal&quot;.  Recently in the past 6 months I had gone through some life altering events and had noticed my depression was coming back more and more. I finally broke down and told my Doctor (I thought the problem would correct itself) So, he changed me to Pristq. I had a slight yawn while on Lexapro and some sexual side effects but they were less than any other medication I had ever taken.  So when Lexapro works it works GREAT!  When it&#039;s run it&#039;s course, time to move on."
