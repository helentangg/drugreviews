"I was on 150mg Effexor XR for about 4 years and it helped me with anxiety and panic attacks. I still had them, but not as often or as extreme. At the same time my doctor also prescribed 0.25mg Xanax for me to take as needed. Just knowing I had them available to help me almost instantly, was more of a panic and anxiety deterrent."
