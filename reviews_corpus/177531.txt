"This drug is the devil. It destroyed my life. It took everything that made me who I am away from me &amp; locked it in a little box. I didn&#039;t notice my personality changing, I didn&#039;t notice how heavily I&#039;d started to drink because it was creating more symptoms than it was treating. My partner, also on Cymbalta for slightly longer than I (probably still on it) also changed... He went from kind &amp; considerate to selfish &amp; cold. He avoided conflict at all costs when I met him, when we parted ways he would happily start arguments.

Yes, Cymbalta helped me for about 2 months, but from there it was all side effects (apart from the aforementioned) of uncontrollable sweating &amp; mood swings on top of the depression &amp; anxiety it was supposed to be treating"
