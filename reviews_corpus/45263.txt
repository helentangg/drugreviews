"I noticed a difference in the first week. It was a positive difference. And then about three weeks later i began to feel how i felt again, and I told my parents and i think that i need more than the 20 mg&#039;s that i&#039;m on currently. But overall I think this drug works very well and you need to find the correct mg&#039;s for your body."
