"I am a 36 year old single female.  I have raised my 2 boys myself for 16 years..no stress in my life...LOL.  I began having anxiety attacks last year. Never experienced before in my life.  Heart racing, couldn&#039;t breath, neck pain thought I was having a heart attack.  My Doctor prescribed Lexapro 10mg once a day.  It took about 2 months before I started noticing any difference in myself.  The girls at the office call it my &quot;happy pill&quot;.  They say sometimes my happiness is overwhelming.  They have noticed more of a change in me than I have.  It is a wonderful medicine.  The only side effects I have experienced was dry mouth when I first started taking the drug.  That went away within a couple weeks"
