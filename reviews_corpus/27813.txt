"I was taking Xanax..0.25 mgs three times everyday for over 13 years. My Dr wanted me to wean off of it so to help thru the process she had me take 5mgs per day of Lexapro (escitolopram).  I kept taking the Lexapro for 1-1/2 years. During this time my Dr raised the dosage to 10 mgs daily. Lexapro wasn&#039;t the medicine for me. It caused more anxiety, mood swings and weight gain along with not feeling like myself. With the help of my Dr I weaned off Lexapro over a period of 3 weeks. After the 2nd day of not taking Lexapro I started with constant brain zaps, fatigue, dizziness with vertigo and felt overall awful. This continued for the next 7 weeks but the withdrawal symptoms lessened each week. I am now at the 8th week and feel wonderful!"
