"I was prescribed this drug for both pain and sleep due to severe osteoarthritis 20 mg 2 - 3 hours before bed to help  me sleep and also 7.5mg of Zopiclone (lunesta) to be taken only if unable to sleep after 2 hours. This combination works wonders after weaning off this drug 3 weeks later the pain and insomnia returned and after 1 week of only 2 hrs sleep a night I am now back on Amitriptyline was tried on gabapentin as well but that had no added benefit but that caused weight gain and water retention"
