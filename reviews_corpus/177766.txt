"I&#039;m 5 weeks into taking Duloxetine for depression and anxiety and have had an overall positive experience.  My anxiety was greatly reduced after only 4 days on 40mg per day including stopping negative thoughts, no more panic attacks at night etc.  The second week I was very tired and depressed without the anxiety, sleeping many hours each day.  But by the third week both depression and anxiety were greatly reduced.  However by the end of the month the anxiety had started to return slightly and my doctor has now increased the dose to 80mg per day.  I had slight nausea, dry mouth and loss of appetite, and some indigestion during the first week or so and now again since I have upped the dose but I imagine these will disappear again soon."
