"Started on 37.5mg for a month. First two days were only side effects - I was a little jumpy, couldn&#039;t keep legs still, and had insomnia. That went away in 48 hours. Then it shifted to making me sleepy and fairly relaxed. However, I still had breakthrough anxiety crying and didn&#039;t feel much change in depression. 

Decided to up the dose and have been at 75mg for a while now. No side effects. This dose has obliterated my anxiety and helped with depression. All I feel is calm and relaxed. I am more outgoing and happy. Only thing I noticed, like so many others, is that it is tough to miss a dose. But, don&#039;t let that dissuade you from trying it. It really has been a miracle for me."
