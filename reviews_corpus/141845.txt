"About 5 years ago I noticed that I was getting extremely upset over little things. I talked to my doctor about it and we decided it was most likely depression causing the erratic moods and sleeplessness. She put me on Lexapro. The first 2 weeks were great but then the side effects were too much. I felt like I was on a roller coaster and when I got upset, I would be filled with rage. I had to stop taking it and switched to Zoloft. I like it but now I am looking for something else because I just don&#039;t feel like I am living life just cruizing through it."
