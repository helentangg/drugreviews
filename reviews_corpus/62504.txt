"I&#039;ve been on many antidepressants since I was 21. Prozac for years that just stopped working. Cymbalta didn&#039;t work, Pristiq had very bad reaction. Recently my Doctor gave me Wellbutrin and the first few weeks worked great but then I had to keep getting the dosage &quot;upped&quot;. Eventually it just wasn&#039;t enough. Than I got Celexa added (which I never heard of, he said it was an older anti depressant) and for the first week it really helped. Had more energy and felt happier. Now it has seemed to &quot;settle in&quot; basically and I still feel depressed but this works the best. Recently I had a couple major tragedies happen in a short amount of time and wasn&#039;t able to cope. I was taking Klonopin up to 3 times a day and it just didn&#039;t work. Now I&#039;m on Ativan."
