"Had a traumatic experience in March, to do with a near death of my husband. I was at the time on Paxil and (as needed) Lorazaepam. To set up an appointment with a mental worker knowing the how the system works Paxil had to be changed and Sertratine was their drug of choice, 50 mg., after 4 weeks to the day, talked dr. to lower dose to 25mg. I believe that Sertraline is not the drug for me is causing other issues with my health . This is not what I want to be on, give back my Paxil and ( if needed) I will take a low dose of my Lorazepam."
