"I am a 27 year old female with a history of anxiety (social anxiety, hypochondria, obsessive thoughts and panic attacks) as well as some depression in the past year or so. I was very nervous about taking this medication but I wish I had started 5 years ago when my anxiety disorder began. It has worked incredibly well for me. I started with 2.5 mg for a few days, then 5mg for a week, then 7.5mg for a few days then 10mg for the past 4 weeks. I experienced some nausea, drowsiness, yawning, hot flashes, sweating, dry mouth and trouble reaching orgasm. I can happily say that these side effects have all resolved now. I feel like my old self, my anxiety and depression are drastically reduced and I just feel happy. So incredibly happy I tried it!"
