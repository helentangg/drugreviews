"Effexor has been a Godsend for me. I went through every med out there to control my depression and anxiety attacks. I have been on it now for 11 years, and it&#039;s still working just fine. I&#039;m not saying every day is roses and rainbows, but, if I can have 6 out of 7 days positive, it&#039;s a far cry better than 7 out of 7 horrible."
