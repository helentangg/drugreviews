"Over the past two years, I have tried Lexapro (effective, but serious sexual side effects), Wellbutrin (bad luck here), Zoloft (not as effective as Lexapro, but much less serious sexual side effects), and now Pristiq.  Little sexual impact, effective, and no noticeable side effects after 5 months.  It may be, however, that my blood pressure is slightly elevated on Pristiq."
