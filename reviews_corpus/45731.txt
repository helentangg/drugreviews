"I&#039;ve only been taking Prozac for a very short while but once it started to kick in, it was like waking up from a three year-long OCD/major depressive nightmare.  I feel like myself for the first time in forever.  I&#039;ve tried other antidepressants and anti-anxiety medicines and nothing else has worked for me.  I&#039;m already having less obsessive thoughts and compulsions, and the crippling sense of dread, anxiety and panic that accompanies my OCD is lifting. I just started it recently so I&#039;m trying not to get my hopes up, but the preliminary results have been amazing.  I&#039;m so grateful to feel like a human being again."
