"I have severe emotional distress and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. I think it was probably passed on by my mother because she has the same disorder. Before I took this medication I just felt that I was never myself especially around large groups of people. There were times when I felt life was hopeless from this point. As soon as I took a dose of Zoloft I felt some of the effects took place and after my doctor increased the dosage to 150 mg I feel like my normal self again. This medicine works wonders. I am no longer hopeless and miserable."
