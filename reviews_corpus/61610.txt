"As you get older you take more knocks and psychological blows to your belief system and at 33 ( had depression all my life didn&#039;t really care lived with it long enough and I felt it kept me grounded ) I started to lose control of my thinking and my depression became overwhelming. Hopelessness and pointlessness in living became a 24 hour battle. I was suicidal and anxiety and constant panic attacks were causing me to lose belief in any sort of future. My dad died because of depression and drug /alcohol misuse. The last thing I wanted was to take medication for it. But it was either go to the doctor or die. 8 months on 40mg a day depression is under control and without doubt I&#039;m learning to live again thanks to these."
