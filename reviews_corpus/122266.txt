"I&#039;ve used Paxil to treat what was panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. SSRI&#039;s in general are a miracle and gave me my life back.  But, neither Paxil nor Lexapro treated the depression that replaced my anxiety. I used to sleep a lot and felt overwhelmed. With Effexor XR, my self-esteem has returned. I&#039;m back in control, accomplishing things, and have a very positive outlook for my future. No side effects."
