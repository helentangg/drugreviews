"This medication really helped my anxiety and depression. I felt so much better--but it came with a cost.
This medication gave me severe Hypoglycemia. 
I am not diabetic thankfully but on this medication it made my blood sugar drop severely low where I would almost pass out at work (and I work in a factory). So I&#039;m sure you can imagine how awful I felt. It&#039;s a catch 22.
I felt better with my anxiety but then I got severe blood sugar drops. 
So I&#039;m off it now and have to start all over again on a new medication. 
If this medicine works for you then great, I envy you. 
This made me so sick I couldn&#039;t stand it. 
So if you take this medication and start getting severely low blood sugar (you&#039;ll know trust me) stop taking it!"
