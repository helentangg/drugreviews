"I was given this medication for anxiety. It didn&#039;t help directly with the anxiety - but it greatly relieved the cause of the anxiety, which was the intense pain I was experiencing. The pain wasn&#039;t home, but it was bearable. The pain relief from an anti-depressant was the clue I needed to work out the cause of the pain - fibromyalgia - and get a diagnosis. Side effects for me were being &quot;hung over&quot; in the morning, and after a year or so of taking it, I started getting depression. I also did feel &quot;numb&quot; emotionally on it. I suspect I got the side effect of depression because my brain was actually healing; when I quit the medication, I no longer had high levels of pain (though some pain did return after quitting this med, but manageable)."
