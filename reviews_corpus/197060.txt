"I was having trouble with erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculating. I thought it was either my blood pressure or diabetes so I went to the doctor and I didn&#039;t my BP was normal and tests showed that I didn&#039;t have diabetes. I was prescribed Viagra months earlier but I stopped taking it because it clogged my sinuses. Then my doctor prescribed me 20mg of Paxil and it&#039;s been a life saver.  Not only does it take seconds to get an erection but I am able to maintain it longer than I have been able to for a while.  I have not experienced any side effects."
