"I&#039;ve had IBS -c&amp;d since I was a kid and it worsened as I got older. I learned within the past year that Lactose and wheat irritates it greatly causing severe pain, diarrhea and bloating. Until 2 months ago I had just resigned myself to having this problem and the depression/anxiety that comes with it. I finally saw a gastroenterologist 2 months ago and he took the time to go over my symptoms and some tests. Finally he suggested Elavil at a dose of 20mg at night since it can have a sedative effect. After 2 weeks I felt WONDERFUL! I felt normal! This has been a medical God send. We might increase the dose to 50mg in a few months since I am on 3 other medications for my bipolar which can lower the effectiveness of Elavil."
