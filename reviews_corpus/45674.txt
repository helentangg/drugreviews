"I also tried 5 to 10mg Prozac. This dose is much less stimulating, doesn&#039;t numb up your emotions as much, and can orgasm more easily than 20mg. Orgasming and feeling my emotions are too important to me to go higher than this dose. This lower dose is just as effective for my anxiety, stress, and depression as the 20mg was. This dose also helps with headache prevention, IBS, PMS, SAD, CFS, poor immune function, and body aches caused by chronic infections such as Epstein Barr."
