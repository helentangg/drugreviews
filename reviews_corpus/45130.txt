"Well looky here.  I wanted to see what was going on with my body and found these interesting posts.  I have been having some issues that are sending me to oncology and talk of leukemia.  About 2 months ago I stopped going on Prozac just to clear out my body with a few different meds.  Night sweats were one deal that my oncology doc brought up (I have the mutated gene for all the ! and ? to go up about leukemia, but have not had the bone marrow test yet, only because I am a wimp) and I have flashes throughout the night, but she is saying sheet wetting sweats.  Not them, but i am ripping off my sheets like I just had my hysterectomy back in 2001.  WHY I HAVE flashes is beyond me, but that Prozac apparently took control of them, so am back on."
