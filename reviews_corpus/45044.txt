"Ok so I love Prozac ... My doctor had me on 20 mg then he wanted to try 20mg of trintellix.  I didn&#039;t really like trintellix.  No side affects but I still was irritable and not focused. I also have ADHD and worry about everything.  Yesterday my doctor put me back on Prozac.  Yes lord.  I cant wait to feel normal again.  This summer that is how I felt, normal. Like, is this really what the world is like.  I like it!!!!! "
