"I have been on Pristiq for about 3 months.  I had insane anxiety and depression as well as insomnia that got so bad I ended up in the ER. I don&#039;t care if I ever come off of Pristiq because it works. I am normal again. I sleep, and for about 2 months I almost forgot what it was like to feel so anxious I could hardly function at work or life. I hesitated to start this medicine because my psychiatrist told me absolutely no drinking. I do have a few drinks on weekends and have no side effects from it. "
