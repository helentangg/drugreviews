"My Dr gave me a sample pack to try, she asked me to start with 5mg and work my way up to 20, I&#039;m up to 10mg but have terrible gas and diarrhea, thinking about going back down to 5mg since I did feel better, unfortunately no one ever feels good when you have gas and explosive diarrhea.  Also my sex drive is back to normal which was a great surprise. I&#039;m going to stay on it a little bit longer and just stay on the 5 mg hopefully the bad side effects will go away if not I will have to stop taking it."
