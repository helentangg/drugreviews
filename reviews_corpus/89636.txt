"I used to be extremely uptight and I am now very laid back, it feels like a dream.  If I dig or look for my anxious thoughts, they are gone. I suffered from uncontrollable panic and crying, also extreme nervousness.  I can now see things in my life more clearer.  I was extremely uptight for the last 5 years and now I am more laid back, I&#039;m sad because I wish I had done this sooner.  Lost the love of my life because of my horrible depression and I feel like if I had been on this sooner, I wouldn&#039;t have pushed him away with my panicky behavior which I thought was just my personality!  We don&#039;t choose depression/anxiety, it is a disease.  I thought it was &quot;me&quot; for years!  Feel a bit guilty about not going on it sooner. I am 23/Female."
