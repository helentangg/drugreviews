"Lexapro changed my life! I had coped with generalized anxiety, depression, even slight OCD since I was a child. Everything in my life was affected by it in some shape or form. I have been on Lexapro 10 mg for three years now and I can&#039;t imagine being without it. I&#039;m happy with my life; work, family, friends. No more anxiety attacks or crying spells or OCD. My husband can 100 percent see the change. I only had a few side effects for the first few weeks like yawning and slight night sweats (didn&#039;t interrupt my sleep) for several months and now none. I think my doctor puts it best; diabetics take insulin because their bodies don&#039;t produce enough and people who have the symptoms above don&#039;t make enough serotonin take a medicine like Lexapro."
