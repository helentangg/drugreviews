"I have suffered from panic attacks for about 12 years.  Because I have a brother who became addicted to xanax and ended up detoxing in a hospital I have been afraid of all medication.  After a major scare concerning a health issue I found I could no longer ignore the consequences of the attacks.  I have lost 20 lbs in 5 years and am now very underweight.  I had no appetite and dreaded meals.  I started taking Celexa 3 weeks ago and the change is amazing.  I still wake up in the middle of the night and I do have very vivid dreams.  However, now when I wake up and do not go into a panic attack.  I am eating 3 meals a day.  The only side effects I have are headaches and constipation.  I would recommend this medicine."
