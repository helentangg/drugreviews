"Before taking Viibryd was on Lexapro for a year. I experienced severe withdrawals while transitioning medication. Electric jolts..severe headaches..extreme anxiety..extreme aggression..paranoia then once the viibryd started working everything stopped I feel good 40mg works best for me. I am bi polar, this drug has helped a great deal with severe mood swings. I hope it continues to work for me."
