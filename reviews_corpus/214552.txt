"I was not going to take Lexapro after reading all the reviews. I was really skeptical about the side effects. I read one very positive review &amp; it changed my mind. I am so glad I started Lexapro two months ago. I was put on Lexapro for anxiety. I was always in a bad mood &amp; everything set me off. I started with 10mg &amp; saw a slight improvement the first week. It wasn&#039;t until the Dr put me on 15mg about a month in that I really saw considerable improvement. Two months later I can honestly say I am am so happy to be on this medication. Everything just seems better. I am happy. I find joy in the things I used to. I look forward to social events. My mood is so much better. I did not gain weight. No sexual side affects. Please give it a try!"
