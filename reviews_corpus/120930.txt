"I&#039;ve been more than 5 years on this medications, there&#039;s a lot of true facts about this drug. It works, great in fibromialgya, I works better than a pure serotoninergic compound, or compares with escitalopram, that made my teeth a bit tight. Is true, if you want to get off this drug, you can have a hard time at the beginning so, better is to do it with a doctor, doing gradual reductions. For me is a good drug base treatment. 
With drive and motivation, try to use it in combination with Wellbutrin or rocket fuel as known in combination with Mirtrazapine 30mg has a very good synergic if you need a power effect. Or a guided treatment for ADHD."
