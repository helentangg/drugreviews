"I lost 3 people in family to death in 15 months. I realized I had lost interest in almost everything, didn&#039;t even watch T.V in that whole time. I finally saw an ad for Cymbalta and asked my doctor about it. It&#039;s been 2 weeks. One week on 30 mg and 1 week on 60 mg. I am already taking interest in things I used to love. No side effects. What a difference this drug has made for me.  I am a bit tired but sleep doesn&#039;t hurt anyone. "
