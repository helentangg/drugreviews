"I have been on Zoloft for only a week and cannot believe how immediate the positive effects are.  I had been taking Effexor for two years for low grade social anxiety.  Whilst it was highly effective for the anxiety, I went from 120lbs to 150lbs in a very short time (very distressing as I am only 5&#039;2&#039;&#039;) and I completely withdrew socially.  I also felt completely unhinged and even suicidal if I accidentally skipped a day.  A week ago I switched to Zoloft (with only a day&#039;s gap in between my cessation of Effexor).  Within an hour of taking it I felt better.  I have felt like my old self again--exercising daily, dropping weight each day, feeling social--even a little sexy (!) and laughing more. Thank goodness I switched medicines."
