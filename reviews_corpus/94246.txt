"I have been on anti-depression medicine for about 10 years.  Different ones, but, the last one - Lexapro-.  I felt like I was going crazy.  I had crazy feelings of not being worth anything and like everyone was against me.  Cried all the time and did not want to do anything.  My doctor started me on Brintellix (20MG) and I felt better after about 1 week.  I have been on it now for 1 month.  I feel like I need this medicine to keep going every day.  It did cause me to feel nauseated daily for about 2 weeks.  That feeling has gone.  But the bad part of this medicine for me is that my taste has changed when I eat certain foods.  I have a better outlook on life and do want to do things but still have issues."
