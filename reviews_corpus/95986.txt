"I&#039;ve suffered from Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder for about 5 years. I tried Seasonique for two years and thought it was working, but every time I had blood work done my markers for heart disease were off the charts. It was so strange and no one could figure out why. I also gained A LOT of weight. I stopped taking the Seasonique and went on the 50 mg Zoloft which I take from day 7 until I menstruate. It has changed my life. Before, I felt like abandoning my entire life and felt so guilty that I couldn&#039;t enjoy my children at all. But now I&#039;m able to get perspective on things. I don&#039;t rage and I&#039;m able to manage my PMDD. I would recommend it to anyone suffering. It&#039;s the only thing I take now and my blood work is all normal."
