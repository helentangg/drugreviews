"What an amazing medicine.  I had tried Paxil in the past, but it made me feel stupid and unmotivated.  Pristiq make me feel like myself, only not on edge and not anywhere near as angry.  My anxiety manifests as rage, and I find myself no longer sitting around with my teeth clenched.  The best part is, it hasn&#039;t messed with my creative abilities at all, so I can still function at my peak while working.  I know it&#039;s not for everyone, but Pristiq seems to be a panacea for what ails me."
