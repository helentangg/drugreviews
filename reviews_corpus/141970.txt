"My doctor and I tried various medications to help me with anxiety. Lexapro has been the most effective. I&#039;ve been taking it for a couple of years - now at 40 mg. It does have side effects that have not dissipated: lack of sex drive, much heavier sweating, and a numbing of emotions. However, the calm I feel far outweighs those problems."
