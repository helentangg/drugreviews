"I really don&#039;t know how to rate this medication.  I only took it for about 3 weeks at 50mg per day.  It really helped with depression and with anxiety.  I have both depression &amp; panic disorder.  But, I started getting what I thought was acne everywhere.  Now, I think it is some sort of allergic reaction because it is getting worse and I am very itchy &amp; my skin feels hot to touch.  I&#039;m not sure.  So I stopped taking it 6 days ago.  I am extremely depressed now and the hives are getting worse each day and I am exhausted.  I can hardly get up in the mornings.  But the hives are just awful.  I keep waiting for them to go away now.  I am so itchy and very tired.  The red bumps are all over my face, neck, and torso."
