"I have been on this medication for approximately 3 weeks now.  It is a God send for me.  I noticed results on day 2.  I have had recurring depressive episodes my entire adult life.  This episode I was unable to get out of bed, sleeping up to 14 hours a day, not going into work (thankfully I have a very understanding boss).  I was not suicidal this time, I actually think that I really didn&#039;t care enough to do anything about it.  My whole attitude was that, &quot;I just don&#039;t care.&quot;  I have anxiety as well, but the episodes have always been well controlled with 1mg of Ativan.  I had the racing thoughts, inability to concentrate, unable to finish almost any task-if I even got as far to start one.  175mg of Effexor and I can finally function."
