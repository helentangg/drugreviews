"I started Zoloft just two months ago. I had been depressed for nearly two years. It got to the point of planning a suicide. I decided to go get help and give life one more shot. The doctor prescribed Zoloft to me and it has made all the difference. I really started noticing a change after the first month. There&#039;s a complete change in my attitude and outlook on life. It may have saved my life."
