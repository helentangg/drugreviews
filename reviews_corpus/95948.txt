"After changing jobs I was feeling depressed and was having anxiety attacks. Although Zoloft worked, and the first day or so were fine, I experienced intense prolonged anxiety in the remaining days of the first week. There were a couple of days there when it was relentless and extremely difficult to deal with. I&#039;m on day 6 now and it seems to have passed. I get the odd pang but it goes away reasonably quickly. I feel calmer and more relaxed. Much less likely to react to little things. I do feel like my sex drive has dropped and it is harder to orgasm. I have a slight dizzy feeling that&#039;s manageable (I hope it goes away). I also commonly have a dry mouth. Lost my appetite. Haven&#039;t felt like exercising. Only 1 week in."
