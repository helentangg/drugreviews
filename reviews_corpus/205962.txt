"I learned quickly that what works for one may not work for another.  I was on Wellbutrin, which worked pretty well for me, except for the ringing in my ears.  My doctor then suggested Cymbalta and I felt worse almost immediately.  We stuck with it, and even increased the dosage, but I felt like I was slipping back into darkness.  I had neither energy nor interest in anything.  I then began Pristiq: four weeks at 50 mg and now 100 mg.  I&#039;m feeling better than I have in many months.  I had a bit of nausea at the beginning and then some headaches when I first bumped up to 100 mg.  In conjunction with an effective therapist I was lucky to find, I&#039;m finally feeling (cautiously) optimistic about this thing called life."
