"It&#039;s great. I get songs in my head or find myself humming, and that hasn&#039;t happened for a long time. More random positive thoughts too. And much less of the bad ones. I sometimes feel down, but it&#039;s not often and I think unavoidable. The side affect I notice is phases of vivid bad dreams. More nightmares and more stand that are stressful and occupy my mind too much, which makes me feel less rested."
