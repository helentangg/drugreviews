"I have been taking Brintellix for about 2 months, after my Lexapro stopped working.  The first day after taking Brintellix, I was nauseous.  I stayed nauseous for 2 weeks.  Now that the nausea has worn off....I LOVE this medication!  I feel less calm, more happy and things don&#039;t get on my nerves as badly.  Just try to tough out the nausea for 2-3 weeks.  It gets better.  After that, you&#039;ll love it.  I highly recommend Brintellix!!"
