"First placed on medication for severe arthritis of one hip. Helped with pain at the lower dose however eventually I needed an increased dose. The increased dose increased my nausea, weird dreams, itchy skin and twitching. My blood pressure also increased. I began to stumble and fall while walking slowly. My nerves seemed  to cause me to tremble internally. Currently I am tired all the time however I can not stay asleep at night. Last year I tried to get off the medication however I had severe withdrawal. I had trouble standing up, I was so dizzy and my stomach was upset. I will soon be getting a hip replacement since the side effects decrease your quality of life.  I am withdrawing from this medication prior to surgery."
