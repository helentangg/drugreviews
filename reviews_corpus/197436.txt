"I&#039;ve been taking Paxil for roughly 4 months. I started on a low dose of 10mg per day then my doctor increased that to 20mg per day. I started taking Paxil because I began having panic attacks. At first I really didn&#039;t notice a big difference, but as the weeks went along, I stopped having panic attacks. Additionally, Paxil has been very helpful with controlling my mood swings. In the past I&#039;ve been known to get a little agitated quickly and often. That has ceased as well.

Side effects: At first I was tired, but this is no longer an issue. I feel fine in that regard. The sexual side effects are minor. I don&#039;t think about sex as much, but getting in the mood has not been an issue. It does take longer to have an orgasm. "
