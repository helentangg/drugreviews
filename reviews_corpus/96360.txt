"I have been taking Zoloft for about a month and a half now. I have noticed severe loss of appetite and I have been vomiting after I take the medication (even with the consumption of food). I have also been dizzy and more tired throughout the day. I also experienced low sex drive, slight memory loss and lack of motivation. On the upside, I haven&#039;t had any panic attacks, thoughts of suicide, and I have not cried since taking the medication."
