"I am diagnosed Bipolar I. I take Trileptal and have switched antidepressants several times. I have tried Lexapro, Zoloft and Prozac. All having relative success with my moods, but loss of libido forced me to switch. Pristiq has been the best I have tried. Both my moods and anxiety have improved. Still less of a libido than without any medication, but better than any of the other antidepressants I have taken. I still have a faint libido, but now experience delayed orgasm. However, the quality of my moods has improved so much that I am more apt to accept this side effect."
