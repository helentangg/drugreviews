"Well I started taking this about two months ago. While I know I haven&#039;t been on it long I know I&#039;ve been on it long enough. Not only are the symptoms bad, but they all are pretty much happening. I go days with out eating because not only do I no longer want to eat, I can&#039;t keep my food down when I do. Sleep forget about it, I never can gat any anymore. Dizzy, sweating, blurd vision, dry mouth, pretty much you name it and it&#039;s happening to me. I will admit though besides the side effects the med did help. I have noticed that my anxiety has gotten better and I can go out and be around people more than I once could. While it&#039;s been nice to actually be able to be around people again without me breaking down I can&#039;t deal with the side effects."
