"This is by far the best antidepressant I have ever taken. I took 10 mg brand name only and it completely took away my depression. It wasn&#039;t a &quot;happy&quot; pill; it just helped me to cope with the normal ups and downs of life like a regular person. It helped me to see that things that used to send me into suicidal despair, were really not the end of the world. I was more confident and assertive, it helped me to take baby steps out of the black pit I was in before, and try new things and be social again. It did turn out that I had some kind of allergy to the pill, which is the only reason I quit taking it. I would highly recommend trying brand name only, start out on a low dose and hang in there for 6 weeks before you decide if you like it or not."
