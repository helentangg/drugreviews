"Initially it helped with anxiety and depression.  However, I started having manic episodes and rapid cycling while on it.  My psychiatrist said no more SSRIs for me, and they generally aren&#039;t recommended for Bipolar.  Now I wish I could have some of the anti-anxiety effects of Zoloft, but that benefit is not worth the risk.  Zoloft gave me slight sexual side effects, overeating, and minor headaches.  That being said, it is a miracle for some."
