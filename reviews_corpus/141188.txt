"I have been on anti-depressants three different times in my life. I was prescribed effexor first, five years later cymbalta and recently Cipralex. Of the three, this has by far worked the best for me. One theme I kept reading during the early weeks when I first started taking the meds is that if can be a bit of a rough ride tapering up. That was the case for me. At first I felt totally out of it and also experienced difficulty getting to sleep. It has now been five weeks and I am taking 10mg. The problems getting to sleep have slowly gone and I feel better each day. My mind is clearer than it&#039;s been in months and I don&#039;t have the crazy irrational worry and OCD that were some of the reasons I was prescribed this in the first place."
