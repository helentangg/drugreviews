"This is my 3rd time being on this med.  For me it runs it course after a few years and I have to get on a different med. I  am highly sensitive to meds of this type. This is day 4 of being on it again. Very low dose of 25 mg.  I am to be on this for 6 days and then suppose to bump up to 50 mg. Just don&#039;t think I will bump up this soon. This med has been truly a lifesaver once again for me. I had been under high stress for a  month and a half and it just kept getting worse.  Went back to dr and I asked him to put me back on Zoloft, generic version. He agreed.  Very thankful for this med. Not quite back to my old self yet but very close. Minor side effects that I tolerate well. Please give this a try. This drug has been around for many years."
