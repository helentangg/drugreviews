"I had wonderful results with hormone therapy but after 5 years my Doc told me to wean off. Did so in 3 weeks. Then 2 years of sleep loss due to constant hot flashes all night long. My new Doc suggested Brisdelle. My insurance covers beautifully so I only pay $3 monthly. But it didn&#039;t work. I was woozy during the day and slept heavily but with terrible dreams that woke me and then I had great difficulty going back to sleep. And still had hot flashes. After 2 1/2 months I said thanks but no thanks. No need for extra medication if it&#039;s not working. The dreams and their after effects are debilitating- re-living them through the day. So I&#039;m weaning off and feeling extra woozy. First week every other day then every third day for another week."
