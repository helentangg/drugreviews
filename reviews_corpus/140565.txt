"I have dealt with bad anxiety for the last 6 years. I began having moderate depression as well and decided I had to try medication. I had a drug abuse problem prior, so I knew I didn&#039;t want to start taking benzodiazepines again for the anxiety. I was prescribed escitalopram and it seriously changed my life. My psychiatrist was right when saying that it doesn&#039;t make you feel happy, but it slows down your brain just enough so that you can let thoughts come and go, rather than ruminating on the negative ones. The only side effect I had was that it kept me up at night so I took it in the morning. Please give it a try if everything else has failed. You can always come off of it slowly if you don&#039;t see results!"
