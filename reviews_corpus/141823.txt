"I was diagnosed with adjustment disorder (with anxiety). When big changes happen in my life, I get panic attacks and severe anxiety. I have been on Lexapro twice now, for a few months each time.

Side effects: Initially, this medicine makes my anxiety worse, irritable, very sleepy, increased sweating and hot flashes. Luckily, these side effects have disappeared after about a week of taking the medicine.

I take 10 mg of Lexapro. Side effects appeared the first day I took the medicine. The anxiety started to subside after a week. Anxiety disappeared after 2 weeks on 10 mg. No problems weaning off the medication.

I love this medicine. It gave me my life back."
