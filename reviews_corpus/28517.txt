"Started Lexapro 5  weeks ago for General Anxiety Disorder.
After going through the anxieties for 3  weeks, and then feeling emotionally flat for about a week plus, things just started getting better. The worrying thing about and obsessing over the medications &quot;mental&quot; side effects eased off.
It&#039;s easier now to take things as they come, talk and interact with others, and I feel at peace with myself for the first time in years!
Anyone considering stopping this medicine during the 1st few weeks, give it time, it actually does get better. I nearly stopped but kept with it, and now I&#039;m actually happy again! Everyone is saying it&#039;s nice to see me smile again."
