"I have BPD II, PTSD &amp; anxiety with agoraphobia. I&#039;ve tried a LOT of different meds &amp; gone unmedicated as well, probably over the last 15 years or so. Right now, I&#039;m on Lithium 900mg. Just stopped Gabapentin 900-1200mg. On Desvenlafaxine 100mg (start, 50mg) about 1 year - Since I started, I&#039;ve been lifted out of a suicidal &amp; debilitating depression. Take into consideration lithium, my moods are more levelled out and I don&#039;t feel like crying at the drop of a hat. I don&#039;t feel completely hopeless. However, I do feel unnecessarily agitated, sleep issues - too much or insomnia, low energy, incessant nausea. I&#039;ve also gained an incredible amount of weight, without appetite. DNA test &quot;Green-lit&quot; Pristiqu... Going to see Dr. today."
