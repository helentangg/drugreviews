"Generic Sertraline gave me some relief but it made me jittery and gave me headaches. After reading testimonials I insisted on the name brand Zoloft. so glad I did. It&#039;s like a completely different medicine. More relaxed and not full of negative thinking. I still get overly anxious if something stressful happens but it doesn&#039;t last long. Side effects are more tolerable, though it does make me tired."
