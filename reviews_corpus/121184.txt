"Apparently, different meds affect different heads.  I have not had a problem on this medicine (venlafaxine) as long as I take the 150mg each morning.  It seems to take the edge off anxiety and depression so far (been on it for several months).  I have had severe problems on other meds, so it&#039;s an individual tryout.  Keep in mind that I started at 37.5, then doubled, and then doubled again.  This gives time for your body to get used to it, I suppose.  My weight has been the same, but I sure would like to see the weight-loss that some people mention.  Like I said, it&#039;s an individual tryout, so no guarantees it will work for you too.  Give it plenty of time, and start small."
