"I started this medication about 7 weeks ago and it has been such a blessing. I have suffered from anxiety on and off since I had my daughter 3 years ago. I decided to try lexapro after I had experienced a state of anxiety in which my body continued to be tense. Yes, the first few weeks of side effects were the worst but just like the rest of the reviews just push through it because it really does get better. I forgot how it felt to be relaxed and calm and this medication helps you get back to that state. No it doesn&#039;t cure you from anxiety but it does help you deal with it in a more rationale way."
