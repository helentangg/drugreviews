"this drug is fantastic, it gives you your life back to you. I finally regained control of my emotions and behavior. It definitely helped rewire my brain to be anxiety-free. 

Remember that for a long lasting cure is good to also attend a licensed psychologist and learn as much as you can about your disease. I learnt to identify and fight everything that caused my anxiety and now I don&#039;t need this medication anymore. I am super happy of having taken it. 

There are two very bad side effects you need to take into account: I would get very dizzy when changing doses or when i forgot to take my pill. I also found it hard to maintain an erection."
