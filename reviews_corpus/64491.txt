"I&#039;ve read so many horror stories about this drug, that I thought I best give a good review! I&#039;ve gone from a self-harming mess. Scared of getting in my car because I might crash and die. Walking past a pond and not wanting to commit suicide, but thinking I could happily sink to the bottom and be at &quot;peace&quot;. I&#039;ve been on 150mg for three months now. I sing to my dogs again, I laugh at stupid stuff, I&#039;m productive in work. I lost two stone in ten weeks from not eating and I didn&#039;t realise how ill I was until I went to see my Dr. I&#039;m happy to put up with the teeth clenching and the fact that it&#039;s really hard to orgasm because I feel human again. Get past the first three weeks side effects when you feel AWFUL!! I&#039;ve never felt better now though."
