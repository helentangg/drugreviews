"I noticed a great improvement in my depression soon after introducing Brintellix to my other meds (latuda, Lamictal, xanax, doxepin, adderall) I also noticed it causes me nausea and vomiting! But I really like this one...hate that it makes me sick! Someone recommended putting it in peanut butter and I think I&#039;ll try that because it works really well for me! I&#039;ve taken my son out like everyday, I couldn&#039;t be a &quot;good&quot; mom before brintellix! Like seriously have never felt better! Vomiting sucks tho, I hate it... really hope peanut butter trick works!"
