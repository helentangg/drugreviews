"I had tried for about 18+ months to find a medicine that would help my depression.  I bottomed out and was contemplating suicide.  My doc prescribed me Trintellix.  I noticed a difference the very first day.  I was skeptical at first, but I got better and better as the days went on.  I had a few occasions of nausea, and even vomited once, but that all went away after about a month.  Trintellix saved my life, literally."
