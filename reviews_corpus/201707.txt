"I am male, 53 years old, &amp; have been on Zoloft (Sertraline) 75mg for 1 year. My problem was with anxiety &amp; I became very sick. I first tried Celexa &amp; I felt worse. After 3 weeks I switched to Zoloft &amp; quickly noticed an improvement. It took about 3 to 4 weeks for Zoloft to start working effectively. By the 3rd month I felt even better &amp; any side effects stopped - they are: trouble sleeping &amp; I took Ativan to relax me and fall asleep, and after 3 months my sleep returned to normal; as for sex, maybe slightly longer to orgasm but no sexual dysfunction. As for alcohol, I still drink &amp; feel fine; there was sweating but this went away. Zoloft works, good luck!"
