"I am also usually very much against taking medications especially ones that can alter your behavior but I have to say that this was a godsend.  I never once considered taking a daily medication before and was very skeptical.  The only reason I rated this product a 9 instead of 10 is because I experienced side effects during my first week of taking it that I was not expecting.  I read that these side effects are pretty rare but they did include symptoms that were similar to flu.  Before I started taking Zoloft, I was extremely anxious, shaky, nervous, and I would get into random fits and be consistently depressed.  Since being on it I have felt much more calm and I feel like I have a better quality of life."
