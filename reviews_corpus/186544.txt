"I&#039;m glad I found this forum.  I&#039;ve been taking Pristiq for about 3 weeks.  My depression is due to post traumatic stress from an abusive marriage and it has helped take the &#039;bite&#039; out of the stress.  Not a miracle drug but after reading the other comments I think I&#039;ll stay on the 50 mg instead of trying a higher dose."
