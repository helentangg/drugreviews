"Cymbalta worked for me for years and then, all of a sudden, just stopped working. This is day 8 of Brintellix. Suicidal ideation went down significantly but side effects are awful. I&#039;m hungry all the time and thinking about food the minute I finish eating. Also, I haven&#039;t read this as a side effect before, but I believe I&#039;m having some sort of allergic reaction as my limbs won&#039;t stop itching. I even took Benadryl for a couple of nights but without much relief. Is anyone else experiencing a similar side effect."
