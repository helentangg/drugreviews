"Out of nowhere I got extremely depressed and had horrible anxiety! I was horrified.. I even had to quit my job. I went to the doctor so many times, I just knew something was horribly wrong. I had blood work done, urine tests, Ct scan on my stomach and MRI on my brain.. After ALL of that came back normal..I knew it was anxiety/depression. I tried celexa 20 at first but it made me so weak I quit taking it.. the doctor switched me to Zoloft and it gave me my life back. It took about 4 weeks to fully feel like myself again. I want you to know if you&#039;re reading this searching for answers..I was once you and I turned to these forums to help me. The Zoloft made me nauseous but it goes away, the side effects go away. HANG IN THERE. I&#039;m on 25mg."
