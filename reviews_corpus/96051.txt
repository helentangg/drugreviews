"I was suffering from depression, hopelessness, anxiety and and overall sense of despair.  I didn&#039;t want to get out of bed, I was short tempered and just unhappy.  I started on 25mg sertraline because I&#039;m thin and 3 weeks later my dose was increased to 50mg.  I have been on it for 3 months now and I&#039;m a new woman.  I feel more positive, happy and content in life.  I&#039;m meeting with a therapist in conjunction with the medication and the despair and anxiety have gone away.  I have lost  weight on the medication and struggle daily because it has zapped my appetite completely.  I was shaky the first weeks but that has subsided, no other side effects.  This medication is fabulous!"
