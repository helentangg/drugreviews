"I am 27 yrs old and suffered from horrible migraine headaches since I was 15. I had the kind of headaches that caused uncontrollable vomiting and kept me in a dark room for days. I felt like I couldn&#039;t have a normal life because I would always think twice about going out fearing a migraine would ruin the day. I am currently on 75mg/day and it has made a significant difference. I no longer have the 9/10 severity migraines for 4-5 days at a time several times per month. I still get headaches but they will go away with something as simple as resting for 20 minutes with my eyes closed. I&#039;m not afraid to go out anymore. The side effects that I have struggled a bit with are weight gain and dry mouth but I will take those any day over the migraines."
