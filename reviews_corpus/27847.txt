"I&#039;m on the 3rd month of taking lexapro , started off with 2.5mg every night for about a week, then upped to 5mg and when I saw my doctor again 2 weeks later he told me to try the 10mg and I have been on 10mg ever since. At first it&#039;s none stop drowsiness weird random dreams and anxiety and insomnia at night. For a good 4-5 weeks , but after that it&#039;s cravings and you eat more and calmly and it gets better! It has work wonders! Hopefully it continues to work!"
