"I have IBS so meds are a problem.  I suffer from complicated grief and PTSD as a result of my loss.  I finally consulted a psychiatrist because primary care Dr. Not knowledgeable enough.  We tried five meds, at least.  The best by far was Lexapro but it made the IBSD so bad it became dangerous.  Now on 50 mg Zoloft generic after starting with half a 25 my pill and slowly working up.  Just had flare of IBS so can&#039;t increase another half as Dr. Prescribed until it settles down.  At first I thought it was working, not any more.  I can&#039;t sit still, a foot is always rapidly shaking, even if I wake up during the night.  I feel really hopeless and like underneath the drugs effects I&#039;m ready to scream.   Have to talk to my psych Dr."
