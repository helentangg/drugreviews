"Came back again saw my old comment on paroxetine (katharinne24) everything was going great until I decided to stop it for some reasons After a week I was feeling tremors inside of me without shaking from the inside. I have been on the pill since January 2017. So I guess it was the withdrawals. It feels terrible I talked to my doctor about it and he said if I would stopped them I will go into depression. Which I know I can do this without them. People who are thinking about starting paroxetine plz be open minded about it. If your planning to have kids later on in the future the withdrawals symptoms are really bad. I hope this helps you guys. I know its hard. But try w/out the pill. Good luckto  everybody that has anxiety."
