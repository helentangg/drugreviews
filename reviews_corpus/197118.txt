"I have been on Paxil for 20 years.  I raised my daughter alone while on this medication, and I thank God for it!  In 20 years I&#039;ve had one serious episode, my doctor added Risperidone to my regimen for a few weeks.  This helped level me out again.  I am happy to report, I believe Paxil saved my life!"
