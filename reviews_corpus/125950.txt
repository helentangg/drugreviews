"Took 10 mg sample for three weeks straight; usually after dinner around 9:30 PM every night.  Helped with a &quot;calm&quot; feeling but would wake up in the middle of the night and then toss/turn.  Didn&#039;t seem to alter my mood in the AM (i.e., didn&#039;t wake up feeling refreshed or less depressed).  Had three weeks of mild diarrhea and dry mouth.  No other noticeable side-effects like nightmares.
