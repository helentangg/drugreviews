"I have been taking Viibryd for three weeks now. I started on 10mg with food and instantly had severe diarrhea, dizziness, and just felt a little mentally absent. I went to bed that day, already feeling mental relief from lifelong MDD. My doctor had me reduce to 5mg for two weeks, which I did, and taking the pill with food and reducing the dosage helped tremendously. I am up to 10mg now and I feel absolutely amazing. The happiness that was mine as a child has returned. I am so glad to find this medication. I thought I was managing well enough with natural therapies and meds, but hit rock bottom this season with no unusually difficult things happening in my life. Science can be the miracle."
