"I suffered from depression and general anxiety disorder. After Effexor, I experienced memories I long forgot which cleared up a lot of confusion.  Today I am clear on all the negative emotional feelings I experienced and when I cannot afford to buy it for a few days, I really experience depression, anxiety and confusion on my own self worth, life, etc.  I feel this medicine is a God-send for me."
