"I&#039;ve been on Effexor now for 2 years after trying Prozac and Celexa (which both had awful side effects). My dose ranged from 37.5 to 112.5. I am now at a point in my life where I feel like I can break through my depression and get off these drugs. I want to start having kids and Effexor is very anti-baby. Today is day 5 and the only thing I have noticed is all I want to do is sleep and I have cried every single day since lowering my dose. I still feel like it is worth it to get off them though. They had only minor side effects such as lowered sex drive and nauseous if you don&#039;t eat but I feel like I can find a more natural way to feel better! Good luck to everyone out there, it&#039;s hard but you can do it!"
