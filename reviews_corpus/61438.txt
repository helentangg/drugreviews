"I am 42 yrs and have been on 40 mg celexa for years. It did help with my anxiety 100% however all I do is sleep and lay and watch TV when I am awake. I DO NOT WANT to do ANYTHING or go ANY WHERE!! I do the bare minimum of my house work when before I was OCD about my home. You could literally eat off the floor, my house did not even look lived in. Celexa has taking many years of my life!! I have decided to taper and been taking 30 mg for a week and already feel SO MUCH BETTER!! I have been doing things around my house that I have neglected before and have plans to do so much more. Also going somewhere does not sound horrible. I mean I did not even go to family functions!! I am on my way of taking my life back!"
