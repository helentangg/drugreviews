"I have been taking generic Prozac 20 mg for 17 days now, 10mg for 10 days before that. I have been reading all of the comments and am starting to have hope! My anxiety has increased a lot since I started this, I take ativan when needed, which is every day! Other than the daily panic attacks I don&#039;t seem to have any side affects which is great! I&#039;ve been thinking that maybe this drug is not for me but after reading other people experiences I will ride it out and hope that everything works out after I&#039;m on it for 6-8 weeks. Hoping and praying it does cause I need my life back!"
