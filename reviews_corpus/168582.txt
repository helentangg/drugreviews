"I have tried all other SSRIs available in the US, all have had undesirable side effects. I started taking Viibryd about four years ago, been very pleased. No sexual side effects, even as I increased dosage last year. The only part I find super tricky is it&#039;s half life. If I forget to take my dose the next morning I start getting an itchy face. Seriously itchy like allergies! As I have ADHD too this is very helpful but annoying. If I am without my pills and have to wait until later in the day to take them some of the worst anger feelings I&#039;ve ever had come out. It&#039;s like the hulk! Itchy hulk! So as long as I always keep a back up supply in my purse I am good."
