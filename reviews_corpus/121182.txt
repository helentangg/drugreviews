"I was on Ven for 18 months  150mg per day increased to 300mg.   I have put on weight, just over 2 stone.   Lost 75% of my hair. It now resembles very fine baby hair.
 The side effects were never made known to me by the doctor that prescribed this awful medication.  
 I have now stopped taking  Ven. I weened myself off in 2 months. I&#039;m now into my  second month Ven free.  I just wish I&#039;d never taken it to begin with."
