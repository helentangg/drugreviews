"I suddenly developed osteoarthritis of the knee with crippling pain. I was overwhelmed with the pain and the challenges of my mobility. My doctor prescribed Cymbalta for the depression I&#039;d developed as a result of ambulatory challenges and within two days, I noticed that my knee pain had subsided.  After a few more days, I realized that the connection with the end of my pain and Cymbalta was obvious.  I called my doctor and learned that she was very much aware that she would kill two birds with one stone if she prescribed Cymbalta.  I&#039;ve been telling all my friends with chronic pain about the wonderful medication.  Yoo-hoo!"
