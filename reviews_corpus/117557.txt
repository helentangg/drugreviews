"I was the person who had all kind of problems and non of them could be linked together. So I seen many doctors and I tried many drugs. I had major depression which all the usual depressants made worse. Debilitating migraines. Moderate to severe muscle and joint pain. Severe insomnia and panic attacks. I was on many medications and in high doses. Didn&#039;t help. It was very frustrating cause no one believed what I experienced was real. Till a friend on college said maybe it&#039;s just in your head and encouraged me to see the counsellor who in turn sent me to.the shrink. And he took me off.everything I was on and put me on nortriptyline with in 3 weeks. I did a 180. Except for the panic attacks which I started taking lorazapam. I&#039;m doing great."
