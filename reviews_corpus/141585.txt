"I am a mom to two sweet, high energy toddlers that challenge me every minute of the day. I did start feeling on the edge and extremely stressed with my older son. Now I have been on Lexapro for almost two months and so far I like it- feel more patient and calmer, but not a Zombie. I was very scared to gain more weight on top of my remaining pregnancy weight, but actually I started losing weight since my appetite decreased. I hope it continues. I am on 10mg. The side effect- super low libido and possibly feeling a bit more tired. If that&#039;s all I am going to experience, I will stick to it for for another 5-6 months. Overall it is way better than Celexa or Zoloft for me. Good luck!"
