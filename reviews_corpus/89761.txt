"I have been on this medication for just shy of 2 months.  I was prescribed it for anxiety and depression, but mostly anxiety.  I have found it to be good, however not so much for anxiety.  It has helped my sleep for the most part,  but I still get significant anxiety in the day time.  I will say you have to give it a good month for it to show it&#039;s benefits, and there are side effects in the beginning, but they are minimal and not significant, mostly just yawning and sexual side effects.  Other then that I have found it to be effective. "
