"I went through a spout of being suicidal.  My doc referred me to 20mg daily.  I have been off for about 5 months, but started taking it again today.  It makes me feel happy, and functional.  I see the good in life, and wake up without anything on my mind.  I fall asleep without anything on my mind. I had no side effects, and sex was still amazing. It takes me longer to reach climax, but that&#039;s a good thing (male). I would recommend this 100%. In 14 short days, you&#039;ll be unrecognizable!"
