"It has been quite a change for the better. I&#039;ve been suffering from panic attacks and really bad anxiety since 16, now 21 and finally broke down, had enough, went to the doc and he put me on sertraline. Been on it for almost 3 months and it has made a huge difference. I feel happier around my coworkers and around people. I haven&#039;t felt weird and uncomfortable or had any bad panic attacks. I&#039;m on 25mg and feel in control of my life. I&#039;m finally feeling normal thanks to this medicine so far. I&#039;ll stick with this dose for awhile and see how it goes. Side effects very little like shaky when I wake up. But I love it so far."
