"This is one of the worst drugs I have ever tried. I was on 60 mg and I don&#039;t recommend to go above 40 mg if you have bipolar it made me feel like a zombie and confused don&#039;t know whether I was happy or normal no emotions also gave me terrible vivid dreams every single day and thats bad and did nothing for my OCD but it may work for you I just gave my experience."
