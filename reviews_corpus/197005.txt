"Seroxat (Paxil) has been amazing for my anxiety so far. I started at 10mg and am now at 30mg. It started to work at 20mg, though I felt a slightly higher dose would be beneficial, and it was. I may step up to 40mg, though I am aware that the additional benefit onto 30mg is minimal, especially considering it is beginning to show beneficial effects.

I was previously taking Lustral (Zoloft) at the maximum dose of 200mg, and although it helped my depression immensely, the effect on my anxiety was minimal. Paxil is rather the opposite. Because social anxiety is my main issue, I much prefer Paxil, though if it were depression I would choose Zoloft. I have been on Paxil for over 2 months."
