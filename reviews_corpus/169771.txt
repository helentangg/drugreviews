"I started on Elavil about 15 yrs ago for fibromyalgia. It brought me a lot of relief at first but it stopped working for me. I still take it but the doctor wants me to take a lessor mg. I was up to 100mg but now I am down to 20mg.  She said that the Elavil made my heart beat really fast.  It can also make your blood sugar go up or down."
