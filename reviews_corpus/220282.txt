"I lived with chronic neck and shoulder pain and when my sleep became affected, I went into anxiety and depression.  I&#039;ve been on amitriptyline for twenty years and I will never come off it.  My daughter recently had pain and anxiety.  Doctors prescribed medicines that sent her heart racing. She used this and one month later she&#039;s so much better.  I believe this medicine stopped the progression of fibromyalgia for me.  It also significantly arrests shingles.  The good old medicines are tried and true. Amitriptyline is excellent for many things."
