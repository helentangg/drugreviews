"I have been on Lexapro 5mg (yes that&#039;s it) for over 3 months now and I&#039;m ready to throw in the towel. First, let me say my anxiety has been greatly reduced. But at what cost? I am a zombie-I have no motivation to do anything and I&#039;m always in a foggy state. My performance at work has greatly suffered, along with my cognitive ability. Social anxiety has gotten worse only because I&#039;m a recluse - just too tired and unmotivated to interact with people! Frequent and strong anhedonia. I wouldn&#039;t advise you not to try lexapro- it is well regarded and often effective. But be cautious as doctors don&#039;t get that there are side effects to this besides sexual ones. I felt the same after one week as I do now but I was continually told it would go away"
