"I have been venlafaxine for the last two months. All I can say is: wow. This medicine completely gave me my life back. The first week or two I did experience a few common symptoms, noticeably the insomnia. Also in the first week I felt a bit &quot;off,&quot; like everything was a bit surreal. However, two months into this medicine and I feel fantastic. Today I was blissfully happy for the first day since I can remember. As cheesy as it sounds, this medicine has definitely given me a new lease on life."
