"Very effective for migraine prevention. I was having one every other day and on this medicine. I&#039;ve gone a week without having a migraine. However it makes my ears ring. The ringing in my ears is driving me insane to the point I can&#039;t take it, so I think unfortunately this medicine is not for me!"
