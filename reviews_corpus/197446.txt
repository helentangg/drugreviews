"I have been on Paxil for about 6 years now and it has really helped lower my anxiety and elevate my mood. When I first started taking it, I noticed I felt calmer and in a better mood within the first 2 days on 10 mg per day. After a couple of months on Paxil, I felt a lot better, but was starting to build up tolerance so my doctor had me increase the dosage to 40 mg/day. The side effects were mostly sexual (decreased sex drive and harder to reach orgasm). I also have experienced weight gain, increased appetite and sleeping more while on Paxil. I highly recommend this drug but make sure not to stop cold turkey because the withdrawal symptoms can be severe with Paxil."
