"I have been on Celexa for over 15 years. I tolerated it very well. I found that 20mgs kept me stable, but I still have episodes of anxiety every now and then. Sometimes I can go years without needing an antianxiety medication, and sometimes I need it until my flare up passes. I&#039;ll be on Celexa for life. Anyone else been on it that long?"
