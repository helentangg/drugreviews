"I believe that Lexapro saved my life. I&#039;m only 21 and I have suffered with Bipolar Disorder, anxiety, and very severe depression. I got so depressed I gave up on everything, I walked away from my job over a simple argument. I simply just quit caring, I let my car get repossessed and I had to declare bankruptcy. I felt so worthless in the world, my doctor kept prescribing ativan, valium, and xanax. Those medications only helped short term. I gave up on life altogether, I drank constantly and quit taking my insulin (Type 1 Diabetes.) My doctor finally prescribed Topamax which caused me to get worse. My doctor got replaced and the new doctor prescribed Lexapro. I am now happy, I got a great job and I have reestablished myself."
