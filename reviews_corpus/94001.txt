"Been on trintellix for bout three months. Last month sobbing has stopped but I&#039;m having vision disturbances. I started at 5 mg then went to ten. From ten to twenty and my head hurt so bad backed down to ten again. The vision issue is still there along with profuse sweating and breakthrough anxiety. Been through so many different antidepressants I&#039;m afraid of what will happen if I hafta go through another drug change. It&#039;s been a nightmare."
