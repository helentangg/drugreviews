"I have anxiety and emetaphobia along with symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder. I was so scared to take Prozac, especially as it seemed that everything I read about it was negative. I am so glad that I found this website, as reading more positive and balanced reviews really helped me to decide to take it and I am so glad I did. I was lucky to have next to no side effects, I felt tired and a little emotionless for a while but that soon passed. It has helped to bring down my anxiety levels a lot and while it is not a miracle cure I feel like myself again, which is really great compared to how I had felt. I feel more balanced emotionally and focused."
