"This review is based on my own experiences and my opinion doesn&#039;t reflect Lexapro (Escitalopram). I found Lexapro&#039;s starting side effects to be mild and tolerable - I experienced dizziness, nausea, dry mouth and sexual dysfunction. However, like I said they were mild and tolerable and they subsided after a few days. I experienced no worsening of my depressive or anxiety symptoms. As I just mentioned I suffer from depression and anxiety and although I didn&#039;t find Lexapro to be a &quot;miracle pill&quot; that fully cured me of my ailment&#039;s but it did significantly alleviate them to mild and tolerable levels. Overall for me Lexapro was an easy antidepressant to start and it has been effective in treating my depression and anxiety."
