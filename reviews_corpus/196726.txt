"I suffered from BDD, and mental checking. I immediately began to have a reduction in obsessive thoughts. For 3 1/2 years I remained on paxil. Going as high as 25mg which was too high for me and gave me intestinal problems, not to mention wanting to sleep all the time. I finally got down to 12mg, then 10, then 7.5, which was good for 1 1/2, and then finally down to 5. I then made the big mistake of throwing the meds out thinking I had beaten OCD. Within a month and a half the anxiety, obsessions were back like never before. Now back on 10mg I feel like myself again. It&#039;s important to remember whenever you start or change a dose it&#039;s going to take a few weeks for your brain to adjust. I also take the med at night. All in all a God send."
