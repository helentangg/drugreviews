"I started taking Lexapro for major depressive disorder about 8 months ago. It started to work great and I got my energy back. I wasn&#039;t as depressed either, but that only lasted about 7 months. After a while my sex drive completely went away and it put a strain on my relationship. I also noticed I started to become more depressed as the time went on. I started to lose all the energy the medicine gave me. I tried to ween off of the medicine and it gave me terrible head aches and horrible nausea. I currently have been perscribed Effexor, hoping that will help with the sex drive."
