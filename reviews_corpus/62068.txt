"Having suffered from anxiety for a while I finally plucked up the courage and went to the doctor. I was sceptical at first but citalopram has been such a fantastic thing. 4 months on my anxiety has Completely gone, I&#039;m back to how I used to be a few years ago. No side affects except for the first week I didn&#039;t sleep as well as I used to but now I sleep better than ever. Whoever is reading this and is indecisive about taking Citalopram all I say is give it a go for a few months. The first 1-2 weeks you won&#039;t have much difference but it does get SO much better. I don&#039;t know what I would have done with out this."
