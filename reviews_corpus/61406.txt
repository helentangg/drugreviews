"I have been on Citalopram 20mg for exactly two weeks now. Side effects I have been experiencing are nausea, nausea when yawning, constant yawning, appetite decrease (down 13 pounds), fatigue, flat affect (numb personality, expressionless face) and intense, deep negativity. I am taking Citalopram for severe anxiety and major depressive disorder. I had some suicidal ideations before starting the medication, but now it feels like my depression is on steroids.  I am working closely with my therapist who wants me to speak to my prescribing Doc about the dose. I am unsure of what to do at this point because I haven&#039;t been on it long enough to experience the benefits. Mostly I am terrified of being locked up."
