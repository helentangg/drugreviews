"I&#039;ve been on Paxil for a few days now, I can already begain to feel it calming me down and controlling my attacks, seems each day I&#039;m getting a bit better. I hope within the next two weeks it completely eliminates them like it has for so many others. Only time can tell I guess, just wanted to say that it is actually working and making me feel better so if you are suffering like I have my whole life (I&#039;m now a 23 year old male) please look into this. This is the only thing I have found to actually do anything for me whatsoever. Don&#039;t live your life terrified you going to have a panic attack infront of people and fear losing your friends and life because of it. Make this move and talk to your doctor about Paxil."
