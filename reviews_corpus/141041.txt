"I took this after being on Zoloft for anxiety &amp; social phobia. Zoloft didn&#039;t work (I was on it for about 4 weeks and it gave me terrible headaches, couldn&#039;t sleep, but felt tired all the time). After about 2 weeks of being on Lexapro, I got severe anxiousness and anger and rage. I had it for 3 days straight and my husband told me to call the doc and get off the meds. I also was dizzy all the time so much that I couldn&#039;t stand up without having to immediately sit down because of the world spinning. I&#039;m switching over to Efexxor now and hoping that will help."
