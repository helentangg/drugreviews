"Been on sertraline for 14 days now for anxiety.  My anxiety started on 12/18/15 and I&#039;m not sure why?  Could have been several things going on at that time in my life, but I didn&#039;t think they were that bad.  I suffered with the anxiety until 12/29/15 and then went to see the doctor because I was scared.  Doctor put me on 25mg of Sertraline.  A few hours after taking it, I felt very calm.  But the next morning, the anxiety was back.  Every day, in the afternoon, my anxiety lightens.  By evening, I feel fine and can just relax with my husband.  From everything I&#039;ve read, it seems that increased anxiety is a side effect of the drug.  I sleep okay, but wake early due to the anxiety.  I am hoping in the next few weeks, this goes away."
