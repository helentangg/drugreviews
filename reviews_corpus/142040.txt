"I went on Lexapro about 4 months ago, for anxiety and panic attacks. While the anxiety had been worsening for the past few years (I&#039;m in my early 20s), I&#039;d started having panic attacks a few months prior to going on Lexapro. At first, I&#039;ll admit that my anxiety worsened but that may be because I was nervous about going on medication, and was analyzing every thought.  But in about a week that passed and since then, Lexapro has definitely improved my daily life. I haven&#039;t had any attacks for about 3 months, and I rarely have anxiety. When I do, I&#039;m able to overcome it much more quickly. "
