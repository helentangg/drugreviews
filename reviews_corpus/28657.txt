"I&#039;ve been taking Lexapro (10mg) for about a week for general anxiety and mild depression. It&#039;s taken the edge off already, particularly on the anxiety side. I am more productive at work and more open socially, without even noticing until afterwards.

Side-effects have been mild: physical jitteriness, a lone bout of diarrhea and an odd sensation in my skin. I can best describe that as feeling like being in a hot, dry climate but without the sensation of heat - tight and tingling. No sexual side-effects so far.

I was on Zoloft a few years ago for more debilitating depression and the side effects with that were much worse, so I feel very positive at this point."
