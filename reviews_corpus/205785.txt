"After taking Celexa, which worked like a wonder drug for about 8 years.  I was put on Cymbalta.  On it, I talked non-stop, was extremely sarcastic and was not able to sleep.
Enter Pristiq.  Folks, I am NOT HAPPY with this medicine.  Has anyone had the up and down ride I am experiencing.  One day I can take on the world, and sleep very well.  Within 1 or 2 following days, I can&#039;t do a THING.  Energy is gone. WOW, I do wish I could find one that helped liked Celexa helped me for years."
