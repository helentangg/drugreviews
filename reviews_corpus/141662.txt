"I was on Lexapro for about two years for anxiety and panic attacks I decided to just stop taking it because I felt I no longer needed it! Biggest mistake of my life. I have had the worst and most horrifying panic attacks you could possibly imagine, needless to say I just started to take it again about three days ago while I know it will take time to completely work. I am for the first time today out of my bed enjoying the beautiful weather outside which for the past week was impossible! I will never stop taking this medicine again I want my life back and with Lexapro I know I will get it."
