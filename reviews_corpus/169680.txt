"I was put on 25mg of amitriptyline because of my dependence to zoplicone (a horrible sleeping pill). It took a few weeks for the amitriptyline to kick in but once it did I was able to easily fall asleep, stay asleep for 8-10 hours and wake up feeling refreshed. I am happy to say that it&#039;s been 3 months and I haven&#039;t had to take any zopiclone which is a big deal for me. I only take 10mg now a night but actually feel like I don&#039;t even need it. I plan to completely stop it next week.
