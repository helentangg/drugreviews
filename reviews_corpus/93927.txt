"This medication has changed my life. It&#039;s been a miracle drug for me after cycling through different meds for the last 3 years, trying to find what worked. I&#039;ve powered through the nausea and vomiting and diarrhea for the last two months. Unfortunately I&#039;m at a point that I am not sure I want to continue the medication due to the nausea. Beside that, I haven&#039;t experienced any other side effects."
