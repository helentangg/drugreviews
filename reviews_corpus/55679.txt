"I was prescribed venlafaxine ~3 months ago for depression co-morbid with anxiety (mostly social in nature). During the first week side-effects included feeling &quot;strange&quot;/&quot;spaced out&quot; and jaw clenching. I still have mild anxiety &quot;jitteryness&quot;, some foul smelling flatulance(!) and limb twitching/achiness. I don&#039;t really know if it has worked for depression so give it a modest rating. I do feel slightly better but I don&#039;t know if I can credit the drugs because I made some significant lifestyle changes. As for anxiety, I do feel less hesitant in conversations and less obsessive over saying something &quot;awkward&quot;. I think this is because of the drugs, but unfortunately these social improvements haven&#039;t really translated into improved confidence"
