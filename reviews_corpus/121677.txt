"Have been on Effexor xr 75mg for about 1 year now for anxiety &amp; panic attacks. I had a constant odd pain in my stomach (like butterflys and hunger). I would sweat uncontrollably &amp; get dizzy &amp; faint if I was put in a situation I wasn&#039;t comfortable with. I went to a Dr. who diagnosed me with anxiety and put me onto Effexor. The first 3 days were hell, every bad review I read on Google I could relate to, I even ended up going to the ER one night as I felt so nauseous and felt like I was losing control and could not stop freaking out. The Dr told me to stick to it, and promised it would get better. I&#039;m so glad I did. I feel that this medication has saved me. I can almost live a normal life again."
