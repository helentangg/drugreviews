"I have a brain tumour, epilepsy and chronic migraines. I take Elavil 200mg daily and Lamictal 400mg. Compared to the multiple meds and combos my drs had me on, Elavil has worked the best for me. It doesn&#039;t stop them (migraines) but my headache hell has improved and post seizure headaches are less severe. With the high dosage of both meds it&#039;s given I&#039;ll feel side effects but overall no major signs of toxicity as I did with other meds."
