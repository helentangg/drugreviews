"I&#039;ve been taking lexapro for about a year now and it seems to help a lot with my social anxiety. I don&#039;t think about nor care what people think as much as I used to. But it does make me kinda have like no emotion toward people&#039;s feeling &amp; what not. Which is a downside. But I used to be afraid of big crowds. I wouldn&#039;t really want to be around people but at the same time I did because I wanted to have friends and be outgoing but it was extremely hard for me. Also I had like mild depression, always negative thoughts. But since I&#039;ve been taking it it&#039;s definitely made me more positive and more friendly. Before I would always worry about everything and when I say everything I mean everything lol. With out it I do have bad withdrawal &amp; it sucks."
