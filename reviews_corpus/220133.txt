"Have been suffering nerve damage pain on my leg after having 3 slipped discs for more than 1.5 years and tried a lot of pain relief tablets but didn&#039;t like the side affects from them plus I still had the pain. My dr perscribed me these, must admit I really didn&#039;t think they would be any good but was surprised from the moment I took the first tablet, the pain had greatly decreased so after a week I started to take 2 every evening after dinner and I hardly know myself. Pain free. And the only side affect is feeling a bit sleepy, hence taking then in the evening."
