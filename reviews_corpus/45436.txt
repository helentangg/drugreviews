"Most of my life I have struggled with severe panic attacks, general anxiety, PTSD &amp; moderate depression. Been on meds twice before until I felt better &amp; then I would stop taking them. This last time it had been close to a year that I had been suffering again before I decided to reluctantly go back on meds. I tried Celexa again- it worked kinda okay in the past but this time it made no improvement for me. Saw the doc who switched me to Prozac- all I can say is WOW! Best yet- I feel like my old, happy self after only 1 month! 10mg the first week, 15 the second and 20mg the last two. Give it time to work &amp; be patient- it might make you feel a bit off &amp; not better at first, but it is a miracle drug. These bad feelings will pass hang in there!"
