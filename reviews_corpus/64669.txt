"This drug has made me feel normal again. What&#039;s better is because I was suffering from anxiety which I never thought would get better I&#039;m now even in a better mood than a normal person. I had a unpleasant onset of this drug which made me feel very sick and strange for the first two to three weeks and after the third week I noticed that this drug has improved me. If you have anxiety this is the perfect medicine for you it actually makes you feel normal again and slightly better than normal. I am still feeling everyday getting better probably due to the fact my brain is realising I&#039;m starting to feel good again that my anxiety is also gone."
