"I&#039;ve been on Lexapro for probably 7 years now. I&#039;ve had severe anxiety, panic attacks, mood issues, EDs, and depression for a long time. Lexapro has helped immensely. I had side effects for the first few weeks (night sweats, felt tired, maybe increased anxiety at first) but I stuck with it and it&#039;s been my staple drug throughout these years compared to the 20  I have tried. I ultimately needed to add a mood stabilizer to get further relief, but Lexapro is definitely a huge help in that. I am on 10mg and Lamictal 50mg"
