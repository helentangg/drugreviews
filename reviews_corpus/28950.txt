"I have only been taking Lexapro for two days but I already felt a difference the first day.  It was like things were not such a big deal.  A few hours after taking the second dose I had this wave of memories from the last year that made me go &quot;wow, I&#039;ve over reacted, over thought, over cried, over expected from myself and others&quot;.  It does make me a bit sleepy so I take it before bed. My appetite is more normal now where I would eat to feel better now I am only eating when I&#039;m hungry.  It makes me thirsty and makes me yawn a lot but overall but I think this may save me and my family from my freak out moments."
