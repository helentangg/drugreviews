"I started celexa because I was having outbursts due to anxiety.  At first I was afraid to try it, so I took a half dose for the first week.  The initial side effects sucked -  fuzzy/cloudy brain, was dizzy, couldn&#039;t concentrate.  I took it at night to sleep thru it until those initial symptoms went away, then back to morning so I can sleep better.  After ~3 weeks I did notice a decrease in my anxiety and outbursts.  It&#039;s been ~2 months now and I have not had any incidents at work, and overall I am much better about dealing with stress.  I don&#039;t feel weird or different or withdrawn or anything otherwise.  I actually thought the meds weren&#039;t working until I looked back &amp; realized I hadn&#039;t had any more episodes!"
