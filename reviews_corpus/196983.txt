"Crippling, horrible anxiety brought on by menopause.  Couldn&#039;t take hormones.  I went through heck trying many antidepressants.  One smart doctor tried me on lowest dose of generic Paxil, never changed the dose, allowed my system to get used to it.  It worked like a charm!  I am able to work full time and do anything I want.  The side effects are minimal for me.  Yes, I gained some weight but now enjoy taking walks to exercise.  No regrets about trying this med at all.  Life saver!"
