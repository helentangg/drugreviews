"Started taking Zoloft about a month ago. The doctor started me out on 50mg for 2 weeks and have been taking 100mg for the last 2 weeks. I feel like the medication is helping in social situations. I am able to join in on conversations and I don&#039;t find myself avoiding groups of people like I used to. I still get very tense and fast heartbeat though. I think I will ask the doctor to up the dosage. I haven&#039;t really noticed any side effects yet, besides lasting longer during sex, and my wife isn&#039;t complaining about that."
