"I started Citalopram in November of 2014 after several short acting antidepressants that didn&#039;t work. I don&#039;t really remember much about the beginning of taking it, but I know that I was doing so well a month later. I even stopped my small addiction to Xanax. It worked really great for me. It suppressed my anxiety to the point where I could function normally in school and in just everyday life. I still had bouts of anxiety but they weren&#039;t a big deal. I couldn&#039;t even be sad at all either! I couldn&#039;t really cry either. It&#039;s really good at suppressing emotions, but overall, it works good. I tapered off of it this summer but it looks like I will need to go back on it. I would recommend it."
