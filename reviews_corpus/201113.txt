"I&#039;ve been taking Zoloft for about half a year now on 200mg. I&#039;m not taking it for depression, it&#039;s being used in conjunction with other things for rage and anger, hypervigilence, as well as dissociation.

I&#039;ve been pretty lucky with this medication because I experience absolutely zero side effects, in fact I could probably take a higher dose right now although I&#039;d rather stick with the minimum and use coping techniques.

I still feel like &quot;me&quot; on Zoloft. In fact I feel more like myself then I have in a long time. I still feel my emotions and everything, although I experience them in a healthy, normal way. I don&#039;t experience all of the irrational, exaggerated, awful feelings and sensations I used to, in a good way.

I feel normal again."
