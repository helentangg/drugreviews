"Lexapro has helped my anxiety and depression and I am glad to be on it. Started in January of 2002 and it brought me back to my senses and I was able to get out of a bad relationship and meet my husband. The side effects are minimal and blend into my daily life without much thought. Sexual side effects can be frustrating but my husband and I have a system figured out that works for us. I will be upping to 20 mg from 15 mg because of some social anxiety over the last few months from a job loss and the isolation and excess worry that followed. For panic, I take klonopin which has been a life saver. Once Lexapro kicked in, I felt like I had always wanted to feel since the age of 15 - normal! Not sad, not scared, not worried or anxious."
