"I&#039;ve been on antidepressants since the age of 12.  I&#039;m 53 now.  I also have fibromyalgia.  I was on Cymbalta.  Due to cost my doc gave me a sample pack of Viibryd.  2 days and I&#039;m in incredible fibro pain, along with severe diarrhea. Not good on my hemorrhoids.  Not sure I&#039;ll stay on this one."
