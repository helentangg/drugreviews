"I hope this helps others because I rarely leave feedback. Please stick with Lexapro if you are having side effects. They will subside. I am only on day 9. The first week I experienced increased anxiety, dilated eyes, gastrointestinal issues, shaky and sweaty hands. It&#039;s not nearly as bad now. Before starting this medication I was experiencing anxiety that blew up quickly, it started happening at night, which effected my sleep, which grew to chronic insomnia for 4 months and that led to me becoming depressed. The longest streak I had of no sleep at all was 6 days straight. I found out that insomnia was a symptom of anxiety/depression. I still have insomnia but its slowly getting better as the medicine gets in my system."
