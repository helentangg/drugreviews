"After suffering from GAD, insomnia, and depression symptoms for almost a year my doctor and I finally agreed to try Zoloft. I had taken trazodone, amitriptyline, and escitalopram separately and in combination without prevail for this long period of time. Sertraline is much more tolerable than escitalopram so far and has allowed me to be myself and enjoy everything about life again.  It has also been very helpful in treating premature ejaculation. If you are having trouble sleeping, worrying needlessly, and suffering through everyday do not hesitate to find the medication right for you. These medications may take much trial and error, but can be a lifesaver.  I hope this is helpful to you, as other reviews have greatly encouraged me!"
