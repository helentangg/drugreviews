"I&#039;ve been on Celexa for almost 3 years now and I&#039;m very happy with the results in regards to my depression. Most of the sideffects went away after the first year but it has definitely altered my sleep and I have absolutely no sex drive. I would highly recommend it for effectiveness but if you&#039;re not okay with living with some side effects it may not be for you."
