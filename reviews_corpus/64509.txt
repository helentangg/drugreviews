"I had 2 miscarriages within six months of each other.  After the 2nd, my anxiety was non-stop.  I started having panic attacks.  I tried paxil and Celexa which helped a little, but didn&#039;t take the anxiety away.  I finally started zoloft a few months ago and at first I was zombie-like, and could barely stay awake, but my Dr encouraged me to give it 4 weeks.  I did, and I am really happy that I toughed it out.  I haven&#039;t been this calm since before my miscarriages.  I am finally feeling relaxed and relief.  The only negative effect I am having is teeth grinding/clenching but I had that on the other drugs as well.  I am no longer exhausted, I feel normal again."
