"I&#039;ve been taking Pristiq for almost a month now. I have OCD, anxiety and depression. I also take 0.5 mg of peach Xanax. The Pristiq works great for me, the Xanax helps with the sleeping side effects of Pristiq but after taking it for this long I can fall asleep pretty well with out it. I wake up with energy and as I take it more and more I feel better."
