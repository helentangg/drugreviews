"This is my first day on Pristiq and I am having the worst side effects. First, I noticed a huge decrease in my appetite. Headache all day, clenched jaw, crying, irritable, a little aggravation. I don&#039;t know if I should stick this out or not. I was really hoping that this would help since I suffer from depression, anxiety, and OCD. I don&#039;t want to give up."
