"I was started off on a 10mg dose of fluoxetine and had bad nausea so my doctor switched me over to Celexa. I have been on it for a few months and it has helped, I had to be upped to a 20mg dose though. I have a really hard time getting to sleep also. But for the most part I like it. I actually found it increased my sex drive."
