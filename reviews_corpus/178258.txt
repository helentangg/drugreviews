"My Doctor diagnosed me with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and put me on Cymbalta.  The first couple of weeks were a little rough with the nausea, but nothing unbearable.  I did lose a bit of weight too.  It did help with my anxiety and depression a lot.  I was on 60mg.  Now 2 years later I was in a different place in my life, did not want to be dependent on a pill, so started weaning off.  Went from 60mg to 30mg.  Then taking it every other day.... then down to 20mg.  Now is the hard part.  Dr told me from there just quit taking it - yah right.  All the blogs you read about the &quot;brain zaps&quot; are so true. "
