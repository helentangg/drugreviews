"I have been on Cymbalta for 3 weeks now and I feel great. It started working within 48 hours. I am not depressed at all. I have more energy. I feel like me again. The first few nights I had problems staying asleep but it is better now. No negative side effects yet. Sometimes it curbs my appetite but I always over-ate anyway (I&#039;m about 20 lbs. overweight) so I think this is a good thing."
