"I began on Amitriptyline about three years ago I think? Started at 25 mgs with the option of increasing to 50 mgs for bladder Interstitial Cystitis. Because of weight gain I stayed mostly at 25 mgs nightly rather than increase the dose. But recently I have increased my dose back up to 50mgs. It is helping with the pelvic and bladder pain associated with Interstitial Cystitis at about 65 percent. It is not though helping with the frequency of urination around the clock as for so many years. But the relief with my abdominal and bladder discomfort is improving at present. For me that is a God send. My other medical and health challenges I am plugging away at. "
