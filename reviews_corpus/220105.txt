"I have migraine and depression. I couldn&#039;t sleep before and had at least four migraine attacks every month. A GP started me on Amitriptyline 25 mg every night for migraine prevention but she doesn&#039;t know that I also have depression (diagnosed by a psychiatrist). Now I&#039;m able to sleep well, and only have migraines one or two times a month. Depression is more manageable now since I get enough sleep. Killing two birds with one stone, ha."
