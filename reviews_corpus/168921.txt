"I have been on multiple antidepressants for 15 years, most recently Lexapro for 5 years and Abilify for 9 months. The Abilify made me gain 15 lbs. and I&#039;ve been flat on the Lexapro, like it&#039;s not working as well as it used to. My doctor prescribed me Viibryd after taking a genetic test to understand which antidepressant will work best for me. I started on 10mg for 7 days, and I&#039;m on my 5th out of 7 days on the 20mgs. So far my side effects have been minimal; a little diarrhea, some dizziness, kind of a &quot;stuffy head&quot; feeling. As long as I eat before taking it I feel okay. My mood has been much better and I&#039;m not as tired as I was on Lexapro. So far so good!"
