"i have severe depression, bipolar &amp; anxiety....i started on 50mgs for about 5 months and felt a little different as in a better mood....still had problems sleeping and felt anxious alot, went back to the doc and boosted up my dose to 100mg and also added Buspar 7,5mg twice a day and a low dose of clonopin.....Feeling great! I would say these are a miracle, back to my old self and loving it!"
