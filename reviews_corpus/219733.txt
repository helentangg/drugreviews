"This drug saved my life. Pudendal neuralgia was making me utterly miserable. I could barely even sit down. But between 10mg and 30mg of this drug and my pain disappeared. I became happier and was able to live my life without thinking about the pain. Highly recommended for anyone with sensitive or painful nerves."
