"Saw relief within 24 hours after starting Paroxetine 12.5 mg.  No more hot flashes! I didn&#039;t realize how much sleep I was missing. Now I wake up rested. Take them in the am so any energy surge happens in the morning. Only having a teeny bit of nausea and loss of appetite in the evening. Drinking water helps.
 I&#039;ll trade that for no more hot flashes."
