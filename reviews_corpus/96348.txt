"I have been on Sertraline 50 mg for 6 months, prescribed for frequent crying spells and difficulty accomplishing anything owing to low feelings in the wake of a divorce and two bereavements. After 2 weeks, I started to feel quite a lot better. The crying virtually stopped, although I still cry occasionally for a few minutes if upset about something.  In the first month, I felt quite euphoric and full of new energy, but now I just feel normal, calm, rational, more industrious and sociable. The drug has not affected my sleep or ability to concentrate. I have, however, gained weight, as well as a sweet tooth. I also often awake with clenched teeth. I am occasionally oddly absent-minded, but better overall, and happier."
