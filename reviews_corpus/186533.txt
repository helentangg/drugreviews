"I have been taking Pristiq for 2.5 weeks now.  I was having very few side effects, lots of yawning initially, but this is improving.  I have mild depression and anxiety and OCD (which only acts up when I am stressed) I have been feeling pretty good but the last few days I have had blurred vision and dizziness, lots of ringing in the ears and dry mouth.  I am hoping this passes. My mood is pretty good and I am sleeping well."
