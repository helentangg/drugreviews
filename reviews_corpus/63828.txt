"I&rsquo;ve had severe depression and low mood my whole 24 years.. self conscious, always think about sleeping/napping when I have nothing to look forward to, can&rsquo;t get myself up and motivated. It&rsquo;s been on and off for forever! I&rsquo;ve never talked to a doctor about it until 2 months ago. (My mom made it seem like it was normal which is why I never talked with anyone about it before) My doctor recommended Zoloft starting at 50mg. The first time I took it, it literally felt like something filled the part I was missing in my brain. It was pretty wild to experience! I immediately felt like this is going to change my life and outlook. It does give you weird bowel movements for the first two weeks anytime you up the dosage. I&rsquo;m on 100mg now!"
