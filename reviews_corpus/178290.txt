"My husband has borderline rheumatoid arthritis, is diabetic, has bouts of atrial fib, and is overweight. He is working on losing weight, so he can have surgical oblation on his heart, to minimize the afib. He kept having extreme muscle/tendon pain. Rheumatologist dx: fibromyalgia. put on Cymbalta, 30 mg x 1wk, then 60mg. been on 60 mg x 5 days, MAJOR difference in the pain. Hasn&#039;t complained at all. Whole new world. Has even helped his depression and anxiety attacks. (not clinically diagnosed, but still there). Unfortunately, it has made him severely tired, and his libido is not what it used to be. Beginning to be on the verge of erectile disfunction. Great drug, but at what cost? Something to think about"
