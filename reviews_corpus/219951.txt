"Took 10 mg for the first time last night for insomnia. To my great surprise, today it seemed to help with both muscle achyness &amp; with anxiety. I slept all day (&amp; needed it), but I suspect that won&#039;t be a big issue once I take this med more regularly (which was the case when I was on mirtazapine/Remeron)."
