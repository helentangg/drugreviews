"Took about a month to kick in, but once it kicked in it was like night and day! I was in a bad way, bad liver issues which just exacerbated my IBS. I can eat and drink what I want now, my sleeping patterns are better, I&#039;m more relaxed, and just happier! Gastro doc put me on 50mg a day at night. What a relief it is to not have to worry about IBS dominating my life!"
