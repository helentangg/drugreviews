"I am 41 and have had all manner of anxiety for most of my life.  Usually this worsens as my self esteem drops. I have taken it twice in the past, once for about 3 years, and recently for about a year.  I stopped taking it almost 8 months ago and I just went back on it yesterday. 20mgs and yesterday was the worst I ever remember feeling.  Headache, restlessness, dry mouth (flu like symptoms), and I ate only because I needed to. I was not hungry. Couldn&#039;t sleep last night so I took 50 mgs of diphenhydramine  and slept well.  Today I feel much better!  I am cutting to only 10mgs for a week and then back to the 20mgs.

I have to say that when you are calling out from your job and afraid to go in stores, like myself, this medicine works!"
