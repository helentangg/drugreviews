"I have been on Zoloft for the past two months now, and last week went up to 100 mg from 50mg. No real great dramatic feelings of elation and euphoria. I would honestly say though that it has diminished my depression quite a bit, and I am not quite as troubled by my regrets, which really bring me down as well as the living situation I am in now.
I have been struggling with suicidal thoughts for the last six months and go back and forth between wanting to just end my existence, to realizing I don&#039;t want to end my life; I just want a higher quality of life."
