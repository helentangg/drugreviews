"I&#039;m not an effusive person, but for me this is a miracle drug.  I have had migraines for 40 years and have tried just about every preventive and palliative med out there. I&#039;ve been taking this for 6 weeks and have only had 2 migraines (both times I had multiple triggers going) that were relatively mild.  I only needed to go up to 20 mg. to get relief.  Had a non-migraine headache the first few mornings I started on 10 mg and then 20 mg. but it went away with tylenol. This is the first review I&#039;ve felt compelled to write for any product."
