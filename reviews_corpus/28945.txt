"Lexapro is a good anti-depressant (I was perscribed this drug for anxiety but felt very positive after about two weeks). That being said, in my opinion it did more for my un-diagnosed depression then for my diagnosed anxiety, which is the reason for the perscription. I did rate this product a 9/10 though, because like I said it seems to be a great anti-depressant."
