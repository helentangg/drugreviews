"Have been on Effexor for 3 years to combat depression and severe hot flashes that are the result of treatment for breast cancer. It definitely does the job, and I plan to stay on it at least until I am done with my 5 years of oral chemo, and then will evaluate staying on it longer. Only drawback is that it will be difficult to get off of it. Will have to work closely with doctor to slowly wean, otherwise there are significant withdrawal symptoms."
