"I had mild panic attack disorder. I started taking the pill and there was a very light headache the first week that went away. I also woke up twice in the first two weeks feeling nausea, but I put up with it. Now I feel fine and I&#039;m a lot happier. I don&#039;t like taking pills but my doctor thinks I should stay on it for at least one year."
