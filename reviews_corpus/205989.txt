"I went to doctor with pains in different parts of my body. My husband was diagnosed with cancer after my baby was born and whole last year was just crazy and into all of that I started to feel pain in my body. Finally I went to doctor last week, after a year of pain. He did all blood work and all check ups and he told me all my pain can be from stress. Well, I got Pristiq last Monday. After one week I have no pain anymore in my body. I can&#039;t believe I didn&#039;t go earlier. And 9.8 lb is gone, it just lets you forget about food. I have dry mouth, otherwise I feel great!
Good luck to all of you!"
