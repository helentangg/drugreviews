"I started lexapro about two weeks ago. Currently, I am happy to say the benefits have out weighed the negative side effects. My side effects have been: nausea, ear ringing, headaches, sleep problems, dry mouth, and sore teeth.  However, my energy has increased and I am in much better shape than I was two weeks ago.  Two weeks ago I would not leave my house, I did not go to work or go out socially.  I would randomly get up set and I was not motivated to do anything.  I am slowly going out more and becoming more the old me."
