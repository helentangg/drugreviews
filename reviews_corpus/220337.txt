"My doctor prescribed a migraine prevention medication for me yesterday,, for the first time in literally years, I did not wake up with pain in my head that was a level 2 (out of 10 for pain) would either drop to a 1 for pain or become a migraine. I can&#039;t tell you how weird it feels to wake up with zero pain."
