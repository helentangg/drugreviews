"I have had depression for a long time, sometimes more serious, sometimes less serious. In the past 7 years, I think I experience a &quot;re-entry shock&quot; going back to the teaching profession in HK.

I need to take it once per day. I did not experience any side effect like sleepiness, dizziness. I can perform my normally heavy duties in my workplace. At first my doctor ask me to take it after evening, but since it will not affect my work and need not be taken after meals, I prefer to take it right after I get up, and I can establish a routine for it easily. 

Soon after I have taken Pristig, all my negative thoughts and feelings disappear like miracle and many people around me commented that I am happier than before."
