"I switched from Effexor when Pristiq became available at the suggestion of my psychiatrist. Effexor was an improvement on my previous medication but I still suffered some anxiety and I experienced increased sweating. Pristiq seems to have reduced my anxiety levels and the sweating may have eased slightly and also, my mood improved. More recently I have also been prescribed dextroamphetamine (for ADHD), which improved my mood further, enabling me to halve my daily dose of Pristiq to 100 mg. I did this with the aim of reducing my sweating coming into summer (I am a resident of Sydney, Australia where the summers are typically hot and humid)."
