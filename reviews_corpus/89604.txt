"I&#039;m an undercover agent and was dealing with a lot of stress. The stress was causing trouble in my personal life. Celexa has been a great help. I am prescribed 20 mg a day.  I take it before bed to avoid the sleepiness during the day.  My family can&#039;t believe the difference in me.  There were some side effects in the beginning, however they went away after 3 or 4 days.  I highly recommended this medication."
