"I am a 25 yr old female took it after I got bad postpartum anxiety after my 2nd son, I couldn&#039;t do everyday things, my husband worked 3rd shift and I was terrified of him leaving. Which never happened since he&#039;s always worked that shift. Went to the doc after almost losing my mind got there and my bp was sky high and I was a nervous wreck I kept feeling faint ect so she gave me an ekg to make sure my heart patterns were at least normal because my bp was outrageous then prescribed me Prozac. I took the Prozac for about a month and it made me a emotional mess it made my panic attacks and anxiety 10 million times worse. So she gave me lexapro I&#039;ve never felt better. I am confident and do everything and I&#039;m actually excited to live again!!"
