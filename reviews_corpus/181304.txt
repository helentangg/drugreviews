"I&#039;ve been on and off Prozac for the last few years. I didn&#039;t think it was working, but after I started taking mental notes, I realized that I was doing much better on it. I have been dealing with chronic anxiety and PTSD which has, in turn, led me into depression. Based on my experience, I think it&#039;s important to note that depression lifting is not like flipping a switch. It takes time for the medicine to work. Now that I&#039;ve been taking it routinely and not missing a dose, I&#039;ve noticed that my &quot;baseline&quot; mood is MUCH better. It happens subtly like a thick fog slowly lifting. I understand that it doesn&#039;t work for everyone, but if you&#039;re not having side effects and you&#039;ve only been on it for a short time, be patient and give it a chance."
