"While on Lexapro, I had the best and worst times of my life. I switched to Lexapro from Paxil in college and it made an immediate difference -- no more brain fog or fatigue, and all the anxiety fighting effects. I was very happy and able to deal with the high stress of superior achievement in a difficult major. However, one night I had too much to drink (not high enough BAC for alcohol poisioning, just more than I was used to) and woke up the next morning a fearful, panicked, and emotional wreck. That was over 2 and 1/2 yrs ago and I am still not the same person I used to be. I can&#039;t say for sure that the Lexapro and the alcohol caused this major change in me, but my time on Lexapro has certainly shown me the polar opposites of my life."
