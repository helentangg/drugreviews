"I have been on 10 mg for 8 weeks.  It does help with my depression and panic attacks.  But I have gained weight and feel numb towards my feelings.  My sex drive is gone.  I workout every day, but the weight is still coming. I have never had a problem losing weight, but now I do. 
The medicine keeps me from feeling the lows,  but also from feeling the highs. I can feel that it has slowed metabolism down.  I don&#039;t no what I sound do, because like I said it has helped."
