"My doctor prescribed Cymbalta for me as an antidepressant.  I am also arthritic and cannot believe how the pain in my joints has improved since I started taking Cymbalta.  I had gotten to the point where I had to go to bed by 7 or 8 pm - not because I was sleepy, but because I was in too much pain to move.  Now I am easily able to do a few more hours of chores before calling it a day.  I am not sure how well it is working as an anti-depressant, but the simple feeling of accomplishment of being an adult able to stay on my feet until &quot;bedtime&quot; is enough to call it a success in my book."
