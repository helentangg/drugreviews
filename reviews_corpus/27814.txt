"I was diagnosed with PTSD,GAD and MD .My life was falling apart.I had dark thought ,wasn&#039;t cleaning my house , completely let myself go , No patience with my kids and a negative outlook on life .my anxiety was So bad I was taking Xanax to cope . lexapro has been a life saver for me 6 weeks later I&#039;m back to my &quot; normal self &quot; I&#039;m very productive , positive , I take care of my house , myself ... it will not make you happy or &quot; high &quot; but make life so much more enjoyable and easier . I&#039;m at 20 mg of lexapro a day ! And I thank god for it ... I&#039;m 10 lbs down . SSRI work different for everyone but if 2 month ago told me my life would change for the better I would have never believed it ! Give it a try ! We are all SURVIVORS! Good luck !"
