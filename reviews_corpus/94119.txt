"Finally found something that worked and I actually felt like myself again. First month was free with card from manufacturer. Next month, $120 co pay, nope not happening, especially since it does not cost this company that much to make this drug. Back to feeling like crap again. Thanks Brintellix for the 4 weeks of getting to feel normal again and then making it too expensive to continue to take it! Really appreciate it!"
