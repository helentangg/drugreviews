"I took my self to the hospital because my life was (and still is) falling apart. But after I took Prozac, I started the feel a bit better. But just as someone here mentioned, after I took it my mind felt empty, for example, since before I went to the hospital, thoughts of self hatred, self loathing and plenty of suicidal thoughts took up 90% of my brain each day. but since they were gone due to the medicine, my brain was unsure how to react. The worst thing in the world could have happened to me and I wouldn&#039;t do anything just smile. But it felt weird. But I did feel a strange sense of optimism while on the drug. I&#039;m NEVER optimistic, always pessimistic. I stopped months ago. I think I&#039;m going to the hospital soon anyway.. I feel it."
