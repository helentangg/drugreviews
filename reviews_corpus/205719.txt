"Pristiq seems to be the medicine that works the best for my fibromyalgia.  I was taking 100mg awhile and felt great except for not being able to sleep well, so I went back to 50mg.  I may go back to 100mg and take something for sleep.  God Bless all of us with this disease. I have had this for 9 years and have tried everything."
