"I struggled with depression and panic attacks for most of my life. Three years ago I was so paranoid I had started hallucinating.  I saw my doctor and was prescribed Citalopram along with therapy. My severe depression has gone, no more paranoia and no more panic attacks. So it has helped enormously with day to day life and work.  Unfortunately I feel my &#039;mood&#039; never changes, I don&#039;t have happy or sad days, just one long stretch of average days. I find it difficult to cry when I know it would be beneficial. I find I have no motivation to do anything...presumably due to nothing making me feel any different. My sex drive drive has gone, as has the ability to orgasm."
