"After previous years on this med I stopped for 7 mths ended up having a nervous break down and I&#039;m now back on 10 mg daily ! I felt awful I lost 7.5 kilo in two weeks I was like a zombie had nausea felt like I was emotionless but three weeks in I feel a huge benefit. I&#039;m not foggy headed, I&#039;m not a basket case, I&#039;m no longer a zombie, I&#039;m putting the lost weight back on and feeling the benefits! I do still have crappy side effects mostly bed room related but I&#039;m hoping in time they will reduce . This medication in comparison to Zoloft for example is much less side effect prone - well it was for me. I can sleep, I can eat, I can function !"
