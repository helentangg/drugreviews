"Overall this medicine prevented migraines. I found that I had less migraines, but when I do get migraines they are of the same severity as when I&#039;m not being medicated. I have no side effects that I know of. Previous medicines didn&#039;t decrease the frequency but did decrease severity. However, I had numbness in my hands and feet while on these medicines."
