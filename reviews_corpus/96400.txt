"Started taking 100mg one year ago for mild post partum depression.  It really helped me for the first 6(ish) months and I definitely felt a change.  I started feeling depressed again (several life &quot;happenings&quot;) so my doctor increased my dose to 150mg, which I have currently been taking for going on 4 months now.  I&#039;ve been feeling depressed again and am at the point where I either need to increase my dose (again...and I&#039;m already on a high dose) or switch to a different medicine.  I think I&#039;m trying the latter. Some of the side effects I have experienced:
insomnia, extreme fatigue, slight weight gain (10 lbs over a one year period...active young mom, so very weird for me), increased depression, headaches."
