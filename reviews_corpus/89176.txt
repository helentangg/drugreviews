"I suffered with anxiety my entire life, and I graduate school it became dehabilitating. I  would have panic attacks randomly and my heart was always racing. My GP put me on 10 mg of Celexa, and after about a week I was feeling much better. I have been on it for about 2 months now and feel like an entirely new person! The only negative side effects I have experienced were a bit of drowsiness when I first started  (my body has adjusted), and frequent, very vivid dreams."
