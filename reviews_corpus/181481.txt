"I have been struggling with major depression for six months and finally when I went to the doctor, I was prescribed with 20mg of Prozac. The first five days were horrible and the worst have I ever felt. After that, I begun feeling good again.

I begun having weird dreams, however and sometimes lack the ability to feel certain feelings.

At the end, I really do believe this medication has saved me."
