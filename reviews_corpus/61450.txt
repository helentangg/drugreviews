"Citalopram calms my mind and body.
Without it I am very aggressive and too active sexually.
Without it I feel as if my testosterone levels were too high.
My wife and I have notice that even my testicles are bigger without Citalopram and that there seems to be a higher blood flow to my penis; it was the experience of a constant state of arousal. Psychologically, without it, I experienced lots of anger, aggressivity, sexual energy, and just a general out of control level of mental energy.
We have both concluded that somehow Citalopram reduces my testosterone levels.
And, let me tell you, I&#039;m happy about it.
I rather feel calm and centered than aggressive, angry, and freaking horny all the time.
So, Citalopram is vital in my life."
