"Unbelievable  change had no idea why I felt the way and why my actions were not normal , but normal for me. 
I am bipolar and the Zoloft is just letting me function better and I can be a real dad not a part time , my family talk to me. 
Getting this control back has made work an whole new thing. I love my job now and have got tools to help me with situations. 
I have also become a lot more creative and finish every thing I start and my memory and arithmetic are 2nd to none which is very important in my job. 
I am so happy, my family are happy. 
I love not being up and down and all around and confused. 
It is a life saver for me. 
I hope every one gets the help they need. 
My blood pressure has also come down and I also write too 
Cheers"
