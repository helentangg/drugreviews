"I have tried many antidepressants, including Celexa (horrible, emotionally flat), Cymbalta (rocked for 2 years, then stopped working) and several others.  I&#039;m a 26 year old male.  My prescribing nurse suggested I try Pristiq.  She started me out at 100mg instead of the traditional 50mg.  She did this because I have a methamphetamine addiction as well (been clean 5 months).  This medication is amazing. It&#039;s only been 7 days, and on day 4 I really started to feel good. I can&#039;t wait to see the full effect!  By the way - to all the guys out there - I&#039;ve had NO sexual/libido effects from this.  In fact, no side effects at all.  Just feeling happier than I have in years, calm, energetic, and interested in life again.  Love Pristiq."
