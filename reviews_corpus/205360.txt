"I have been taking antidepressants for years;  prozac, celexa,cymbalta, and now pristiq.  I have always had problems stopping taking antidepressants and needed to go back on the medication after a while.  I even stopped taking pristiq and found it necessary to go back on the drug after stopping.  This last time I started taking pristiq I felt much better after some weeks and everything was back to normal.  Then I began to notice more depression symptoms like brain fog, general lack of motivation, tiredness, major forgetfulness.  I went out of town and even forgot to take the pills with me.  This is where things took a strange turn.  I felt better the next day!  Every day that went by I felt better.  I forgot what felt like to fell this good"
