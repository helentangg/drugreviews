"Was prescribed this medication on Friday, August 28th of this year.  So it has only been 5 days since I first started taking it .  I have never been on any anti-depressant medication before.  Didn&#039;t know I was depressed until the doctor said that I was.  I went to him with complaints of stress (mostly work-related, some personal), weight gain (seems I focus on food and cravings a lot more these days, not to mention that I had a car accident on 4/03/09 and broke my neck, had to wear a halo for 3 months so that could also explain my weight gain of almost 30lbs), and difficulty falling asleep.  Side effects so far have been; insomnia, no changes really in appetite, and failure to have an orgasm! "
