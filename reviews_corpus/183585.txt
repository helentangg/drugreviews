"I was prescribed this medicine after failed attempts on Effexor, Lexapro, Zoloft and Pristq.  I&#039;ve been trying different medicines and have been having panic attacks ever since I can remember, even when I was a child in school, after my son was born it got WORSE. I am currently taking Xanax, two 0.5mgs a day and clonazepam two 1mg&#039;s a day and also a Beta Blocker for fast heart rate. I&#039;ve been on the Beta Blocker for 6 years. I have been taking Xanax and clonazepam for 3 years. They do not help my anxiety 100%. I still get attacks, but not full blown panic attacks like I used to. I took my first Cymbalta last night. I&#039;m supposed to take 20mg in the morning and another 20mg at night. No side effects yet! I&#039;m hoping this will be the pill that works for me!"
