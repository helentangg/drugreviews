"I am a 27yr old female, 115lbs. I have been on Lexapro for 2 months now for anxiety. I have never had any problems with anxiety until I started working full-time (a lot of hours that are non-stop) and I started planning my wedding. All of this made me very irritable, stressed to the max, edgy, worried about every little thing, and just not myself. Since I&#039;ve been on Lexapro I&#039;ve been back to myself and better. I&#039;m relaxed and easy going through this stressful time! It took a few weeks for the medicine to kick in and for me to get over a few side effects (insomnia, constipation, tired in the afternoon) but it&#039;s totally worth it."
