"My anxiety is pretty bad to the point it makes me feel ADHD, depressed and overall anxious. It&#039;s not that I dread or fear anything, it feels more like I&#039;m in a constant panic attack, defensively bad mood! Then came Paxil and my life did a complete 180. I still have ADHD but as soon as I notice it acting up I&#039;m able to laugh it off, stop, and reorganize to get back on track. I don&#039;t feel helpless or sad anymore. This runs on both sides of my family but more so on the maternal side.  I &quot;got better&quot; so I stopped cold turkey. Do not do this. It is absolutely horrific and I experienced some of the worst silent panic attacks ever!  Meedless to say, I am back on it and will never come off it again!"
