"I took Sertraline for two months after a short period of depression.
Started with stomach cramps and terrible diarrohea. Could not think at all. Began to have difficulty in reading and writing. Became agressive and unpleasant to be around. Felt like all my emotions and cognitive abilities had been switched off. Reactions became so slow that I stopped driving out of fear of killing someone. Became paranoid. It&#039;s awful."
