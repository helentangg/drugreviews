"For the first few weeks of taking it made me feel super bad my sleeping was all over the place and I actually felt very suicidal it made my anxiety crazy I couldn&#039;t go out without feeling terrible I was nervous to go out and always on edge, eventually it started getting a bit better but mostly felt down maybe 1 or 2 days of the month I&#039;d be pretty happier than normal but then after a few months it died down and they personally didn&#039;t work at all like they just stopped showing affect so I gave up and stopped taking them and now I feel the same as I do if I was taking them these are probably 1 of the worst antidepressants I&#039;ve took refuse to take them again (also made me pretty nauseous the first few weeks)"
