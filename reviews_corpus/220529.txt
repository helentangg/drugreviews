"I was having bad headaches, and recently stopped taking Zoloft, it didn&#039;t work. This helped a lot with the headaches, and helped me to sleep better. I starting having more vivid dreams while sleeping. This is the best antidepressant I&#039;ve taken. I didn&#039;t even know it was an antidepressant till I looked it up. As I swore never to take antidepressants again but it helped with the headaches, so I guess I will just keep taking this magic pill. I wish I was prescribed this years sooner!"
