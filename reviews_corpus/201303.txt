"I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. I&#039;m 33 years old and have a son. I would panic everytime he wasn&#039;t with me. I would think of the craziest &quot;what ifs&quot; that could happen. I got to the point I couldn&#039;t even drive on the highway because I might get into an accident. I was prescribed zoloft at 25mg for six weeks...I felt nauseous for a couple days but was fine. Then I was put up to 50mg for another six weeks. I was really tired and my anxiety spiked but I stuck it out. Now I&#039;m on 100mg. Have been for 2 weeks. Not a single anxiety attack. I feel less tired but still get sleepy through out the day. My son can be at school, out swimming or doing other kid things and my mind doesn&#039;t head straight to horrible what if thoughts. Yay!!"
