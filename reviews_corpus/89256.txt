"I woke up.from the absolute craziest dream I&#039;ve ever had...FREAKING OUT...COULD NOT BREATH, AND THOUGHT I WAS DIEING...I immediately called ppl in my family that have been on antidepressants, and they said just give it time, the side effects will go away...so I continued to take it...today is day 14, I am more nervous and depressed still...I have NO emotion, my head hurts constantly, STILL have no balance...I think my doctor WRONGLY prescribed me something I DIDN&#039;T need, that COMPLETELY ruins with you (when you don&#039;t really need it ) I&#039;m severely annoyed...stopping my med tomorrow and flushing the rest of my pills...I&#039;m sooo disgusted"
