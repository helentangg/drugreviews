"It works well. I did gain weight with it since it does affect the regions of the brain associated with this but I simply try to stay fit by exercising (which helps my condition as well) and eat healthy foods. Be religious in taking your daily dose, though! The side effects are quite debilitating. This includes being completely useless for anything, sleeping, really weird dreams and the vertigo described (quite accurately) here as an electrical zapping sensation. Any time you move your head or eyes and it feels like a bzzzzt. Also heed the warning of interaction with alcohol. ONE very occasional glass of wine or beer but that&#039;s it! Mixing this medicine and any alcohol beyond the occasional drink and you&#039;ll get seriously messed up."
