"I have had migraines my entire adult life. When I got the most recent pain, the doctors were quick to call it a migraine. I felt like my head would explode, and I had none of the other side effects attributed to migraines. My doctor instead now calls it &quot;severe head pain&quot;. I had it every other day for about a month. I actually called &quot;911&quot; at one point because I thought I was dying the pain was so horrible. When I was first given elavil I was skeptical since it was touted as an &quot;anit-depressant&quot;. I took it, and the first three days I actually had to take naps because it made me so sleepy. On the fourth day I realized that although I still felt a little sleepy, I was now officially four days head pain free. It has been a Godsend."
