"I&#039;m a 40 year old male that has taken Celexa for about 10 years now for aniexty. I take 40mg once a day. It works well to manage my anxiety. With the higher dose I take it can cause nausea for me if taken on an empty stomach. I also get sleepy for an hour or two after taking it so I take it at bed time. The only issue I&#039;ve had is forgetting to take or running out of this medication. The withdrawl is pretty bad after about 4 days of not taking causing anxiety, dizziness, brain fog, &quot;brain zaps&quot;, insomnia and flu like symptoms. Celexa has worked very well for me and would recommend it for treating anxiety. Just don&#039;t suddenly stop taking it. You have to slowly ween off."
