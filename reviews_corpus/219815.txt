"After probably a little less than 2 weeks I started having auditory and visual hallucinations at night. It also hasn&#039;t really improved my sleep or helped my fibro pain. It has significant worsened my depression and possibly worsened my anxiety which I somewhat expected while my body adjusted to the medication change but I cannot deal with the hallucinations and am planning on changing it"
