"This medication did not work for me.  It is important to note, however, that I suffer more from anxiety than depression.  On Pristiq I felt like I was on a constant roller coaster.  I gave the medication 3 (long) months.  I would wake up in the night with panic attacks and would surprise even myself with sudden outbursts.  Not to mention, it was super expensive. NOT worth it for me. I&#039;m back on Zoloft and Xanax and feeling MUCH better."
