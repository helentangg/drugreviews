"I&#039;m 19 years old, have 2 kids. I have been taking Zoloft 25mg since June of 2010 for anxiety, stress, and a little depression. I LOVE it. Before I was on it I was really bad, I could not go outside of my house without having a anxiety attack, couldn&#039;t drive or anything!  I tried to get over it by myself but I couldn&#039;t do it so I went for it and the first day I took Zoloft I noticed a difference (usually it takes a few weeks) the only side effects that I noticed was that I cannot sleep like I used to. If you are thinking about trying Zoloft make sure its a good idea for you, talk to your doctor and be sure to get as much info as possible and remember we are all different. You may or may not have any side effects, but it doesn&#039;t hurt to try. Good luck."
