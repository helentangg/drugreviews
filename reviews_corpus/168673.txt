"This drug probably kept me from killing myself, but missing a dose once after using it for almost two years and I was diagnosed with withdrawal.  It hurt. Bad.  Worse was getting was even my Psychiatrist called &quot;brain zaps&quot;.  They started out very infrequent and weak, but as time went on it was torture.  They were around the clock and even woke me up every night several times each night.  I almost want to leave my email if the drug company wanted to talk to me about it, but can only imagine the emails I would get from everywhere.  Best wishes to all."
