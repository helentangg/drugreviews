"Day 2 of Lexapro. Only side effect is strong yawning. Used to be on Paxil 2 years ago and had extreme side effects (soft stools, night sweats, vivid dreams). Was doing okay controlling my anxiety for the last 2 years until I recently have been under excessive stress causing anxiety and fear of death.  I am hoping Lexapro will work well. My husband and I were planning on getting pregnant soon, so I&#039;m not sure if I will have to come off Lexapro or not."
