"I tried wellbutrin for depression which worked for a couple months, but then I had memory issues.I couldn&#039;t remember what I was thinking two seconds later.It scared the crap out of me so badly I couldn&#039;t try anything else. Years went by trying to go without, now I&#039;m prescribed sertraline for depression. At first I was terrified but realized I was psyching myself out of actually giving it a try. Before I took this, I barely was eating, sleeping...horrible...now, I gained 5-6 lbs back, can sleep, I just feel better. Some days are rough but not as bad as they used to be. I noticed a lack of sex drive, and dry mouth, but besides that feel great. My dosage is due to be upped now, so I do notice some effectiveness going down, but this is normal."
