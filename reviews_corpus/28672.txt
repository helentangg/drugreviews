"I have been on Lexapro for about 12 days (never been on anything like this in my life). I am very sensitive to the medicine. I can take about 2.5- 5mg. I have some shakiness, and had increased anxiety in the beginning. It seems to be leveling off now. My doctor recommended that I take 5mg in the beginning and then increase to 10 mg later. I think 5mg is enough for me. I get night sweats as well. Lost weight, because I am not hungry; nauseated. The anxiety has decreased. Its working."
