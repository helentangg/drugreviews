"As a septic and someone who hasn&#039;t had good experiences with antidepressants I must say this medication has been amazing. I must have tried 6-8 different types and always felt they either didn&#039;t work or the side effects were too unbearable. I went to my GP to go back on to Lexapro as it was the one I did best on (but lost all libido) and he suggested Pristiq which is similar but not supposed to come with the same side effects. So far (8 weeks in) I&#039;m pleased to say it has been a blessing. As had a major impact on the my depression which was getting disturbing and I am feeling no immediate side effects."
