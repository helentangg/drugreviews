"On Day 4 with the 10Mg pill no more nausea! I had one lucid dream but it was fine. Day 5 no problems. I am writing again which is something I have not done in a very long time. So I am seeing positive things already! That is why I gave a higher rating. Waiting to see what happens in 2 days when I step up to the 20Mg pills. "
