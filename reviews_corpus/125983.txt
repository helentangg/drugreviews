"In 3 days, I felt better. Titrated to 40mg. The medicine turned evil. My heart pounding with strong palpitations.  As I was falling asleep, had feeling of leaving my body &amp; hovering over myself being awake in a horrifying world that seemed absolutely real. Sleep paralysis. Dr. added beta-blocker for heart. Gained 21lbs in 6wks. Decided to stop it. Dr. said go from 40-20. I couldn&#039;t do that suddenly-I needed to go down slowly.  I went from 40-30mg. Night terrors lessened. Went to 25, then 20. Felt good at 20; heart calmed down for a few days. Thought I&#039;d stay at 20 but then the evil again. 18, 15, 10, 5, 3mg. It&#039;s taken over a month to come off it. 1st day without it. Feel down &amp; edgy. Started Wellbutrin.  "
