"I have general anxiety and occasional bouts of high anxiety. I was taking .5 Xanax 1-2x day not everyday only when I had the bouts of high anxiety.  I was on Viibryd 10mg for a week then to 20mg and that&#039;s where I&#039;ve been for about a year.  After about 2-3 weeks of starting the Viibryd I noticed I no longer needed the Xanax. I have noticed no change in sex drive however I have noticed I get extremely sleepy if I&#039;m not actively doing something.. Over the past 2 months I have slowly reduced to 10mg hoping to reduce the daytime sleepiness but I have noticed I am getting my bouts of high anxiety again so will end up going back to 20mg."
