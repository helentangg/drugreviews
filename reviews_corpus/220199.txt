"I had stomach problem since 2009. I am not going into detail cause no one is interested in my entire experience with IBS. I should say that due to IBS I had to quit university, part time job and worse of all the woman I have been with since many years left me. So I went from being one of the most social people to being one of the most lonely people. 
A doctor one day wrote me a script for &quot;amitriptyline&quot; I don&#039;t need to explain how it effected not only on my stomach but it has brought a great change in my life as a whole, it was just spot on!"
