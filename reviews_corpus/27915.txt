"I started lexapro after 3 years of severe anxiety and panic attacks pretty much daily. I was so terrified to take anything fearing it would make it worse or make me crazy. But my anxiety pushed me to major depression from my irrational fears. I kept thinking it&#039;s gonna get so bad I&#039;m gonna end up losing my job and becoming homeless. Reviews from others scared me also. Finally I told myself it couldn&#039;t get any worse than this. Well it&#039;s been 2 weeks and I haven&#039;t felt that horrible &quot;dread&quot; feeling. I&#039;m way less anxious. It&#039;s pretty much saved me. There are side effects.  Tolerable though. Nausea and headaches the first few days. It also causes bad urinary retention and sweating. But to me,they&#039;re worth not feeling the way I did."
