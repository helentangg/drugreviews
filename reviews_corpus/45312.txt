"If I had known it was possible to feel this way I would have started taking Prozac a long time ago. I fought myself on trying another anti depressant after being off lexapro for about a year. I guess lexapro did not work for me as well as Prozac has because I want to hit myself for starting this earlier.  I feel normal, I have energy to get through the day and I can focus. I have lost some weight though as I do not eat constantly like I used too (because that&#039;s all I felt like doing)"
