"My anxiety has been with me since I was 11. I ended up dropping out of both high school and university because I couldn&#039;t go to my classes. I used to dread any and all excursions out of the house, no matter how small. I would feel horribly anxious if anything outside of my normal routine came up (doctor&#039;s appointments, people coming over, etc). Forget working. I felt so hopeless and didn&#039;t want to take prescription medication, but I&#039;m so glad I did. I&#039;ve been on paroxetine for 4 months and I feel like a different person. I don&#039;t drive myself nuts with worry. I started on 10mg and went up to 20mg a month ago. Side effects I&#039;ve experienced are both drowsiness during the day and insomnia at night. It&#039;s worth it. I&#039;m even looking for jobs now!"
