"I was prescribed Effexor XR for the treatment of anxiety and slight depression. The bottom line is this, it made me more calm but at the expense of too many side effects. It wasn&#039;t worth it to me. It made me more calm almost clouded my mind. I was sleepy throughout the day and had no energy. But if I took my second dose too late in the day, I couldn&#039;t sleep at night. I also sweated profusely more often, typically within a couple of hours of taking the medicine. Perhaps the most profound side effect I experienced was the inability to achieve ejaculation. This was NEVER a problem in my life until I began taking Effexor. My doctor has now switched me to Wellbutrin. Hope it works."
