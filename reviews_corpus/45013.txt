"I am twenty six years old and have suffered from significant depression since I was a child. For years I just dealt with it always going from one crisis to another. I&#039;ve had a handful of suicide attempts starting from my early teens to young adult years. I would especially have trouble during the two weeks leading up to my period. Crying episodes and just an overall feeling of depression. I was put on Prozac about three years ago and it has made a world of difference. I&#039;m happy again and able to function to my best ability, I&#039;m focused and driven. Sometimes I forget to take it and the depression comes back. But as long as I&#039;m taking my daily dose as prescribed, I&#039;m great!"
