"Been on amitriptyline for 3-1/2 weeks now  i.e.  10mg for 1st 3 weeks and now 20mg for last few days, taken at night before sleeping. It has reduced my lower back and other arthritic pains all day, helped me get better sleep, and also reduced my depression/anxiety levels considerably. So far I am a definite fan. The only negative side effect so far is occasional moderate dry mouth which is tolerable, particularly considering all the benefits."
