"This medicine along with a 5HTP2 inhibitor helped lift depression in 2 months. I took Prozac after that for about 8 years with some break in between. When in depression a higher dose helps, for maintenance low dose was enough. If you don&#039;t see effects after 6-8 weeks at the high dose level, adding a medicine with a different action adding lithium at a small dose may help. This was the case for me. Brain is interesting and unique, but it is able to repair itself which is a great thing. It will get back to normal or even better with the right medicine. Don&#039;t underestimate the effect of adding exercise, fish oils, sunlight, social support, yoga and other healthy habits. Some of us have high maintenance brains, but it is totally worth it!"
