"My husband has been taking this for depression and anxiety for little over 3 weeks now...up to 40 mg.  The only negative is the diarrhea and nausea. This is extreme at the present.  The good thing is that he DOES feel better mentally and there is no sexual side effects (as it was with Zoloft).  I am HOPING the negative side effects go away soon."
