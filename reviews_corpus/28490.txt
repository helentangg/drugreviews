"After dealing with generalized anxiety for most of my life, I suddenly began to have severe panic attacks. After 2 years of suffering in silence, I addressed this problem &amp; my general doctor gave me Lexapro and I began with 5mg daily. The side effects included drowsiness and frequent yawning. BUT, finally after 2 - 3 weeks I felt like a %u201Cnormal human%u201D again and still suffer from absolutely NO side effects. After 2  months of taking this medication (I have stayed on 5mg/daily), I am back to my productive and excited self. I have been able to do almost everything again and have not suffered from any panic attacks since I began the medication! STAY STRONG and HOPEFUL!"
