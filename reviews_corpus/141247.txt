"I have been taking Lexapro (10 mg) for three months now.  The first month, I had side effects such as extreme tiredness and nausea, then heartburn later but after a few weeks, those things got better and the medication has really helped my depression and anxiety.  Everyone encouraged me to see it through and not stop.  I&#039;m so glad they did!  I feel almost normal again.  I still get tired sometimes and do have the occasional bout of nausea but that&#039;s easy to live with knowing that I can laugh again and my family sees a happier wife and mom.  Also, I&#039;m finding that taking a couple of teaspoons of apple cider vinegar chased with a glass of water every day has seemed to help with the heartburn."
