"I had a severe  head injury a year and a half-ago, I was in a coma for 2 months. After my head injury I started having major anxiety, and major sleep problems. I was first prescribed celexa at 20mg a day. I told the doctor multiple times that celexa was not right for me.
My doctor prescribed me zoloft at 50 mg a day. I now take 200mg, divided in morning/night. It has worked wonders in my life, I had problems with my memory, and since taking this medication my memory has improved as well as my anxiety, BY 10 FOLD!! 200mg of zoloft a day, plus 300 mg of trazadone a night. I feel amazing:)"
