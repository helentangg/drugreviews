"I&#039;m 22 and I&#039;ve had anxiety and some bad panic attacks for the past 2 years. I&#039;m prescribed ativan (lorazapam) to take as needed. It helped a lot for traveling and definitely for shutting down panic attacks but it also gives you a lot of ups and downs. Its a benzo so it essentially just shuts you down and makes you pass out, it doesn&#039;t really help fix the problem. 

I talked to my doctor this summer about getting on an every day anxiety medicine and my mom takes prozac so I thought maybe it&#039;ll help me too. I started at 10 for a month and then increased to 20 for 2 months. I can honestly say I haven&#039;t had bad side effects at all but also it just felt like it wasn&#039;t doing anything. I just recently increased to 40 this month, hoping for the best!"
