"I was given Paxil 20 mg for depression.  I had not taken any antidepressant during my life.  My greatest sadness was when my brother died.  It stopped working.  I know this med is NOT a magic pill.  Instead of feeling better, I was feeling worse.  I did NOT do ANY research on this med.  My Family Practice MD told me to take 40 mg.  Again, I took the med but didn&#039;t really feel well on this med.  I gained LOTS of weight.  I was put on the med because I was depressed and NOT eating.  That changed quickly, when I started the Paxil.  I finally decided that Paxil was not working for me, I was overweight and I decided to wean from this med.  I started educating myself regarding Paxil.  Paxil MUST be tapered/weaned.  Med can&#039;t be stopped abruptly."
