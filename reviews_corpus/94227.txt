"I&#039;ve been taking a Drug called Brintellix for a few days now. I take one pill in mornings with breakfast and for the first time in years  I have became active, creative, happy and I have the will to get up and be motivated.  I felt like my old self but younger. I haven&#039;t been on the med long but so far I&#039;m amazed. I can&#039;t tolerate other antidepressants and they don&#039;t work for me.  So right now I&#039;m living life and not just watching life pass by. I recommended talking to your Dr about Brintellix if you&#039;re living like I was."
