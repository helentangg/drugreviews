"The positive: it has an almost immediate effect, from Day One there&#039;s a lift in mood. Effexor XR Also gives a feeling of energy, both mental and physical. I&#039;ve also noticed a significant decrease in my social anxiety, I can talk to anyone without feeling nervous -  this &#039;extra&#039; effect began, again, on Day One.                                     The negative: slight feelings of nausea with a definite decrease in appetite. I don&#039;t really enjoy my meals as much while on Effexor. I&#039;ve also noticed a form of a insominia since starting - early awakenings and not being able to get back to sleep."
