"I&#039;ve been on lexapro for the past 2 months for my bad anxiety, and it has helped tremendously. Before I was barraged with worrying thoughts day in and day out and no matter what I did, I couldn&#039;t escape them. Now I go through most days without any worry. When I do get an anxious thought, I can discard them fairly easily, in other words they don&#039;t &quot;stick&quot; anymore. I was also suffering from depersonalization, and this drug has significantly helped me with that by reducing my anxiety. The only downside is that the drug makes me fairly drowsy, but it isn&#039;t something I can&#039;t handle. I would greatly recommend this drug."
