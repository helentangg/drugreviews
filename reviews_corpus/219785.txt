"I took this drug for low back pain and anxiety. I stayed on for two weeks at only 10mg before night.  It does help you sleep and does prevent migraines, without a doubt.  However, I woke up with a lot of pain in my upper back and chest from muscle spasms I guess.  Every night.  And you can&#039;t drink alcohol at all unless it&#039;s late at night after the drug wears off.  Oh, and it doesn&#039;t help with anxiety or panic attacks at all."
