"I have been dealing with major depressive disorder,  severe anxiety, OCD, PTSD, and manic depression since I was a teen (now 41) due to extreme childhood trauma. I have also had substance abuse/self-medication issues for these same reasons for over 20 years now. Clean and sober, my insomnia and anxiety was so severe that I would get about 2-3 hrs of sleep naturally at night or with weed (also stopped...) 
Finally could not stand it anymore as I was getting to the point that was was having bad thoughts about not wanting to be here anymore.. I&#039;m an accountant who is a single mother with a special needs 3 year old and works over 50 hours per week, so, my stress is about as high as it can get.

I LOVE THIS MED. HAVE NEVER FELT BETTER."
