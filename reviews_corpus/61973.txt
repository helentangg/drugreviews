"Been suffering from general anxiety/ social anxiety and acute OCD. Never been on any medication before and decided it was time to see a doctor to treat the anxiety. In the first week I had no side effects at all and felt fine. After this week I had a week booked off work and stupidly decided to drink about 5 times throughout this week, quite heavily. The day after stopping drinking I felt really anxious and shaky, which was fairly usual for me. Then the day after this I had 3 days of nausea, tremours, sweating, tiredness. On the fourth day I begin to feel slightly better and begin to get my appetite back. By week 3 I feel really good at the moment, no anxiety although do have racing thoughts. Would not drink heavily using this medication."
