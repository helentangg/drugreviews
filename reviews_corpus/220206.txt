"I was 21 totally healthy male without ANY health problems. One morning I woke up with a horrible headache and it only continued to get worse. I experienced headaches 24 hours a day for months. I had every test known and they couldn&#039;t find anything wrong me. I have took 75mg of amitriptyline for close to 4 years now. The drug has worked wonders on me and as long as I take my medication every night, I never experience a headache unless under extreme stress. Wonder drug, mild side effects. First few years dry mouth was really intense. It is harder for me to fall asleep now, have to take 5-10mg of melatonin as well. Hoping to ween off the medication shortly tho, as I don&#039;t want my whole life to be controlled through a pill bottle."
