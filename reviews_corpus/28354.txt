"I was diagnosed,  with a panic disorder. I was always well traveled, worked hard and had a great social life, then my life changed over night. You can&#039;t explain to anyone the feeling of complete helplessness unless you are living it. Anyway long story short Lexapro saved my life, even though could not orgasm while taking it and gained 10 kilos, but I was able too come off it after a year. And now I&#039;m living a normal life again."
