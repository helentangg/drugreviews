"Took it for about 2 years - get ready for weight gain, loss of interest in everything, extreme tiredness, zero interest in sex. Sure, my &quot;depression&quot; symptoms felt a little better (but would have had at least the same result with healthy diet and exercise). It took the &quot;bad feelings&quot; away, but it also took the &quot;good feelings&quot; away. When I weened off Pristiq, every five seconds I felt like an electric shock in my brain (that&#039;s the best I can describe the feel) it was the worst 2-3 weeks of my life."
