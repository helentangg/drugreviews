"My migraines have been cut in half by using 10mg elavil daily. I used to get severe headaches 2 times per month lasting at least 3 days each. Now I get about 1 every 4-6 weeks and for the most part they last a day or 2 and are
Much less severe. I used to be bed ridden for days and it&#039;s happened only once or twice since starting elavil 6 months ag. I pray that this continues and that I don&#039;t build a tolerance and have to up my dosage because I don&#039;t like taking meds"
