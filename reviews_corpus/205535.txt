"I have been on many medication for depression with associated panic attacks.  Nothing has worked but since my doctor prescribed me Pristiq CR 50 mg and I can now officially say it&#039;s changed my life! I&#039;m a survivor of many tragic events and feel like I&#039;m not a victim anymore.  I do clench my teeth more often but so what this side effect is nothing to compare to my unwillingness to live!  Give it time, three months or more you&#039;ll feel better I promise!"
