"I&#039;m 16 years old and I&#039;ve been taking sertraline for about two years now and it&#039;s completely changed my life. Early on in high school I struggled with anxiety that gave me severe stomach aches and as I started to think about getting one, I would bring one on. I still had a good amount of friends and was very social but often avoided social situations due to my fear of getting sick. I didn&#039;t go on a few class field trips because I worried about having to &quot;go&quot; on the bus and my anxiety haunted every aspect of my life which often made me feel frustrated and depressed. Finally, I went to the doctor and was prescribed 50mg of sertraline. After a few weeks I was already seeing changes in how my body reacted to situations and I&#039;m happier than ever."
