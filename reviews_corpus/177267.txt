"I started taking 30mg of Cymbalta about a month ago. I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia and was prescribed Cymbalta mainly for depression, but I must say that Cymbalta has significantly helped the chronic pain. I had side effects the first two weeks or so, but they mostly went away. As far as depression goes though, it hasn&#039;t really helped me."
