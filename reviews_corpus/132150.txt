"I have used this anti-depressant at varying dosages over the past 5 years and it has proved to be very efficient at managing my depression. I do wish to highlight the intense physical withdrawal symptoms I experience if I miss even one dose (flu-like symptoms). This is an excellent medicine but when you choose to lower your dosage, only do it in conjunction with a medical professional as it can be quite physically demanding."
