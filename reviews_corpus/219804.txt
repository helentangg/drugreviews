"I had migraines for 11+ years. It took probably 7 years to finally find sumatriptan for abortion of acute attack which would happen 2-6 times a week. I would react to weather, stress, lack of sleep, 3-d movies... u name it. Once I started PA school due to stress migraines became almost daily thing and it would debilitate my life and studying to the point I couldn&#039;t not stand anymore. Since I have insomnia for many years Amitryptiline sounded superior to other options and I started taking 10 mg before going to sleep. It&#039;s my week 3 with all possible triggers and absolutely zero migraines! I am so happy I cant even believe it worked so well. I only had one small headache ( which used to be often too). And I definitely fall asleep better !"
