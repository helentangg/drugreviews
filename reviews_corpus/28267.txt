"I have always been an anxious person with major bouts of anxiety and OCD. But have always managed to keep it under control - except for a few months ago.
I had tried healthy eating, CBT, exercise, yoga, positive affirmations, acupuncture and more....nothing seemed to work for me.
Doctor suggested Lexapro and I was so so reluctant as I HATE the idea of antidepressants! And I wasn&#039;t even depressed!!!! :(
BUT - I started... 2.5mg at first. Then after one week upped to 5mg - which I am on now. PROS: Feel a lot better, sleep great, calm, no weight gain
CONS: Not much energy, little lack of sex drive.
I wanted to come off it first but PLEASE hang in there!! It actually works!
Goodluck and wishing you all the happiness that I have on Lexapro xxxx"
