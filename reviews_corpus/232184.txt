"I took this drug awhile back, I was on it for 3 years. I don&#039;t recall ever having side effects while initially starting or during taking it over time. This drug seemed to help my depression and anxiety significantly, probably more than I actually realized at the time. Only problem I had was, if I missed a dose I&#039;d be hit with massive emotional distress. Crying over the stupidest things rather it was positive or negative crying. My emotions were intense. After a long time without medicine now, trying to beat depression and anxiety on my own and being somewhat successful for an extended period of time I&#039;ve been contemplating using it again. I&#039;ve tried almost all of these meds, and this is the one that&#039;s worked for me the most."
