"I&#039;ve only been on Brintellix for 3 weeks and I am about to reach my &quot;therapeutic dose&quot; of 20mg as prescribed by my psychiatrist (started at 5mg and have been going up 5mg each week). I&#039;ve experienced zero nausea which seems to be the biggest complaint people have. I was warned to take the pill with a full breakfast though so maybe that has helped? I&#039;ve also not had a decrease in sexual desire nor ability to perform which is awesome. By the second day I felt almost intensely cheery and had great urges to do artistic activities. The only side effect I seem to have had is very vivid dreams. No nightmares though. Just high-def dreams about walking my dog or shopping."
