"I am amazed at how this medication changed my life. I often compare myself to a duck in water, where the problems just glide right over me, which never used to be the case.  Issues that may have cause depression or anxiety in the past are now handled without confusing emotions.  The only reason I give it a 9 are the horrific side effects if I miss even one dose.  Strange nightmares, shaking, confusion and even an odd ability to sleep for more than 10 hours straight. Does it deter me from continuing with this medication? Absolutely not."
