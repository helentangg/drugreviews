"I was prescribed Lexapro 5 mg for perimenopausal rages and major depressive disorder.  Considering this is my first anti-depressant, I cautiously started with half a tablet (2.5mg).  The side effects were horrible: severe dizziness, headaches, nausea, and confusion.  I could not function at work.  Overtime, my depression, angry outbursts, rumination worsened and started to affect my interaction with coworkers.  I decided to give Lexapro another try and start with 1/4 of a tablet (1.25 mg).  I took the Lexapro at bedtime, and in the morning, I was the happiest I&#039;ve been in months, no anxiety, no negative repetitive thoughts.  This is a strong drug.  My recommendation is to start slowly to avoid severe side effects and then increase if needed"
