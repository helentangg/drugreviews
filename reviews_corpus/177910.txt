"Cymbalta saved my sanity. I was under incredible work pressure and stress for three solid months (new job covering for one coworker on maternity leave another coworker having a sudden heart attack and Crohn&#039;s flare up. Me running the office for three months, even though I&#039;d just been hired). I had a doctor&#039;s appointment and broke down on the table. He prescribed Celexa first, which gave me severe panic attacks. Then he switched me to Cymbalta, and I was back to normal within days. 

The downside: It is extremely hard to stop taking it. I was intended to take it only for the short term, until things calmed down at work. Two years later, I&#039;m still on it because going off was WEIRD. Numbness, tingling, weird sensory inputs, distraction."
