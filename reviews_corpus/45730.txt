"After 4 years of trying alternatives for my depression/anxiety, such as meditation, yoga and exercise, I had returned to a very black hole and a very hopeless feeling. I spent Christmas all alone in my house, angry, vulnerable and lonely.  I have returned to medication and have been on Prozac for 2 weeks. It has not fully kicked in yet.  I feel a loss of appetite, very tired at times but on the flip side, I am slowly starting to become involved in more activities.  Today I completed all my ironing, which laid on my chair for 6 months, cleaned the house and could actually concentrate on reading a book."
