"I&#039;m diabetic and I&#039;ve been taking amitriptyline hydrochloride for five weeks for pain from peripheral neuropathy in my feet and hands. I&#039;m amazed at how well this medication works. I&#039;m on 30mg daily and my hands are 90% improved and the pain in my feet has vanished for the first time in years. I do have a few of the more common side effects ... vivid dreams, occasional dry mouth, and once in while I feel lightheaded if I stand up too quickly. I can live with all of these if I can be pain-free."
