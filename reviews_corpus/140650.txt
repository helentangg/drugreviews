"I&#039;ve been on lexapro for about 4 1/2 months now. I had really bad GAD and OCD I couldn&#039;t be left alone with my kids and wouldn&#039;t drive just from fear of pretty much everything. I am taking 15mg and it&#039;s working.. not as anxious and now able to be alone with my kids and now am driving. I am just pretty frustrated because since I&#039;ve been on this drug my hair has fallen out quite a bit I have half the amount of hair I used to have.. (which is hard because I do hair) and I&#039;m also starting to see the weight gain. But It has helped a lot with me mentally. I&#039;m kind of scared to wean off. I&#039;m just over my hair falling out."
