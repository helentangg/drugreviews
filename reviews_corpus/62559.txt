"I was prescribed Celexa due to Anxiety, stress and depression. I initially went to the Doctor for insomnia. Went through that for 7-10 weeks. Because I was not sleeping, I started getting panic attacks at night. The Doctor prescribed Ativan for the anxiety and Ambien at night. The Ambien didn&#039;t work. So I found myself taking the Ativan only at night which seemed to help a little bit. One night I experienced a horrific panic attack after taking the Ativan. I all of a sudden started crying and just started feeling miserable. I came to realize that I am deeply depressed and I need help. Long story short. Went to the Doctor and after 10 days of being on Celexa, I truly feel better and I am averaging 6-7 hours of sleep where as 11 days ago it was only 3-4 hours."
