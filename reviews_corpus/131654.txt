"So here is my experience with Effexor, I hope it helps you make an informed decision.  I started taking it two months ago as a change to the Citalopram I have been on for over 5 years.  I suffer from anxiety.  The first three weeks, improvement in my mood, better temper control also.  Week three, the insomnia kicked in and strange urges to HAVE to get up and move around.  Week four,  Serious shortness of breath on exertion, ringing ears, lip numbness and malaise.  Turns out I was allergic to it!  Doc tool me off it, immediately, then the withdraw began.  OH my G*#.  The worst experience of my life.  Paranoia, hallucinations, panic attacks (my first ever), breathing trouble, the list goes on. If you research the withdraw, it&#039;s not worth it!"
