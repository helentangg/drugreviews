"HORRIBLE!!  Dr. put me on 37.5mg for my Anxiety and Depression took one around 6pm and woke up at 2:30am feeling like I was on crack.  Got to work at 7am and my Boss asked me what was wrong with me.  My pupils were as dilated as they could be and my eyes were bugging out I continued to feel spun out most of the day.  Started feeling better around 8pm and was able to sleep thru the night but woke up with a Migraine and could not focus.  WILL NEVER TOUCH THIS STUFF AGAIN!!!"
