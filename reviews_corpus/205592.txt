"I take 100 mg. It works but side effects were I was always tired and gained weight. Took Wellbutrin with it when I was taking 50mg. That made me feel close to normal but I got headaches and gained weight. I was good enough with just the Pristiq, but not great. The doctor then added Dextroamphetamine, which now has me feeling normal, like when I was in my 20&#039;s. I have motivation, energy, focus, no panic, no depression and once again feel the wide range of emotions as they are meant to feel. I am able to take joy in the small things in life and not dwell on the down sides. My weight has also adjusted back to pre-medication size."
