"Overall, I had a positive experience with venlafaxine, but users need to be aware of how difficult it can be to quit. I was on 150mg for about 18 months - not very long - and when I wanted to come off of it, it was a very difficult experience. I still am weaning myself off grain by grain, because cold turkey is simply not an option. The main withdrawal symptom I experience is electric shock sensations in the brain. They even make a noise. I&#039;ve heard that some people don&#039;t have as much of a problem with it, but I don&#039;t know how. In the beginning, I thought venlafaxine changed my life in a positive way, but over time it became somewhat less effective. It&#039;s an effective medication, but beware of the consequences. Took it with 60mg mirtazapine."
