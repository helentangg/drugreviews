"So I&#039;m on day 4 of 25mg of Zoloft.....
I will titrate up to 50 mg at day 7....
I have to say, I feel amazing. Is it normal for it to work this quickly.  I&#039;m taking it for anxiety. Mild side effects, can tell something is going on in my head. Feel a little tired or foggy about an hour after I take it, but otherwise I feel good. I understand the full effects won&#039;t take hold for a while.... will it actually make me feel better that I already do?? I seriously cannot believe I feel it this fast.  Any thought are welcome."
