"I&#039;m 15 years old and I have taken a wide variety of antidepressants. I find Lexapro to be one of the better ones. I take 10mg of Lexapro and it does alright. I have noticed a 10  Pound weight gain on about 1 1/2 months of taking this. From my experiences with antidepressants, I do not like them. This is my 4th antidepressant and I just can&#039;t find the right one."
