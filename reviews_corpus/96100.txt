"I think I needed this medication for years...but, I was ashamed to talk to my doctor. Before Zoloft, I was never content, nervous, paranoid, could not let things go and was not the parent I wanted to be (no patience, lacked interest). Then I suffered a breakdown. The Dr. put me on Zoloft. I was totally afraid of taking antidepressants - I have no idea why. The first week I had pretty bad nausea but I stuck with it (and it subsided). Five months later, I feel as if the whole situation was a blessing. I am happy and tolerant, easy-going and I feel like I&#039;m a better parent. Don&#039;t know about detrimental side effects but I&#039;m sure it wasn&#039;t healthy living the way I without the medicines."
