I was on Zanex 1 mg 2x a day I have been through the worst thing a parent can go through losing a child  12 years ago she was 8 then I&#039;m a widow now lost my husband 5 years ago he was 41. I  see a psychiatrist huh nothing mends a broken heart but I will keep trying what the Dr keeps putting me on"
