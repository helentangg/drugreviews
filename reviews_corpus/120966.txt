"Male, 32y. I was suffering from stomach complex pains, terrible headaches, and depression. 16 months ago I was prescribed for Venlafaxin up to 225mg/day and Trimipramin for sleeping. It was very complicated with ups and downs but I finally got to a normal life. Since then I have gained ~10kgs but I think it&#039;s not bad for me since I was underweight before. My doctor suggested me to decrease it gradually and cut it off. I was on 75mg until yesterday and today I didn&#039;t take it. In the afternoon I was very irritated and anxious but it could be the short term withdrawal. I will update you if I could stay off medication. I wish you all strength and happiness"
