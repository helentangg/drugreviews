"I had a horrible experience with Zoloft. I started on a low-dose liquid form and at first it seemed to be really lifting my mood, reducing my anxiety, and boosting my self esteem. But I soon began experiencing extreme irratibility and episodes of destructive rage aimed at my belongings or myself. I loved the benefits, but the side effects were ruining my life and relationships, so I discontinued. In addition to rage, I also experienced severe prolonged pms (3 weeks duration), constant breast pain and swelling, unrestorative sleep, and awful vivid lifelike nightmares. In terms of reducing depression and anxiety, I&#039;d give it a 9, but the side effects didn&#039;t enable me to continue taking it."
