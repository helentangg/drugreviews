"I wanted to offer my support and experience with venlafaxine. I have never taken antidepressants.

After an accident which had altered my lifestyle and enjoyment of life, I talked to my doctor. I did not want to risk going on pain meds (I know myself well enough that I fear possible addiction), and he suggested an antidepressant. I started at 75 for 2 weeks and increased to 150 after.

Initially had weird experience of wanting to smile for no reason. I didn&#039;t like this as it almost seemed like mental gymnastics to reconcile this induced sense of excessive happiness and smiling at nothing. This has mostly subsided now after 1 month on 150.

The only other big side effect is sexual. Other men may understand where I am coming from. My libido is actually slightly higher (may be because I am no longer depressed), and I have no problem at all with arousal. However actually climaxing is a big effort. When it does finally happen though, it&#039;s more intense.

Other than that, no side effects. On the major plus side, no more sleeping in and calling in sick to work. I have a renewed zest for life. It&#039;s amazing to look forward to waking up and starting my day! I start up conversations with strangers at the coffee shop and and have made new friends. If a negative thought enters my mind, it just seems to dissolve as quickly as it came.

I am truly thrilled with this antidepressant and recommend."
