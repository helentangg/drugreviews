"I was prescribed doxepin for my depression and around the time that my doxepin was introduced, I started sleeping worse than I had been ( I had used to be able to fall asleep easily with the trazodone I took, but upon taking the doxepin, I was finding myself unable to even fall asleep) and when the doctor increased the dose because it had stopped working for my depression, I ended up with full blown insomnia where I couldn&#039;t fall asleep most days and if I did manage to fall asleep halfway through the night, I couldn&#039;t stay asleep. About a week after I stopped the doxepin, my insomnia started going away"
