"I started with 30mg of Cymbalta and after 4 days noticed I had absolutely no pain whatsoever anywhere in my body after years of pain. I was ecstatic. That lasted 2 1/2 months and it all came back with a vengeance. I stopped taking it cold with no ill effects. Very disappointed. I&#039;m trying 5HTP and CoQ10 now so we&#039;ll see."
