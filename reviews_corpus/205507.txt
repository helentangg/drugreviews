"I have suffered from severe anxiety (GAD) and was taking more and more Klonopin as time went on.  I am very sensitive to medication and have tried many different SSRI/SNRI&#039;s through the year with horrible side effects.  Finally, I had DNA testing to see what I would respond to and the result was Pristiq.  I started it several months ago in a small dose (I split the pills even though they say don&#039;t do this) and within a few days my anxiety literally went away.  I was able to cut my Klonopin in 1/2 over a two month period.  The first week or two I was extremely tired but that passed.  The only side effect I get from time to time is migraines.  It still amazes me that my anxiety has disappeared.  I no longer keep Klonopin in my  pocket!"
