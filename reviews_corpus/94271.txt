"I was recently switched from Lexapro to Brintellix for depression related to ADHD.  The transition was fairly horrible for about 1.5 weeks but then it has been smooth sailing.  The doctor that switched my meds, both for ADHD and depression, used a serotonin blood test and a DNA test.  I really appreciated the science behind the selection vs. the trial and error method that many doctors use.  I highly recommend the DNA test as it shows which medicines work best for your body across several areas (not just ADHD and depression).  I didn&#039;t think the other meds were working and the DNA confirmed that they were not a good fit for me at all.  Some insurances will not cover the DNA testing so make sure you ask because it can be expensive."
