"I am a 51yr old female and started taking Brintellix about 3 weeks ago.  Nausea and vomiting since day 1 that has gotten progressively worse as I&#039;ve increased dosage per my Dr&#039;s orders.  I have bruises on my sides and back from the constant itching.  I&#039;ve just gone thru one of the most stressful times of my life and I feel like this medication not only didn&#039;t help but made me feel so much worse. I&#039;ve been a coffee drinker for 30 yrs and I can&#039;t even stomach that in the mornings anymore."
