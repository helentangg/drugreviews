"I suffered from anxiety with significant episodes of depression since I was 19 (I&#039;m 26 now). My anxiety manifested itself as hypochondria mostly. I constantly thought I had cancer, MS, or some other debilitating disease. I feared my loved ones would die or get sick as well. The worry would consume my thoughts and I would spend hours online researching these illnesses, convinced I had something. Started taking Lexapro 20 MG and I&#039;ve never looked back. My hypochondria is completely gone. &quot;Sad&quot; moods are no longer full-blown depressive episodes. My life seems so much lighter and more manageable. There&#039;s no shame in taking medicine if you need it. I only wish I had started it sooner."
