"So far Celexa has been great.  I was very hesitant to start a medicine for depression/anxiety.  But after being extremely low, hostile and moody for months it was time to go to the doctor.  I was angry and depressed all the time. I just wish I went for help sooner. Also, I used to get panic pains in my chest and throat probably 100 times a day.  Sudden scared and nervous little panics over anything!  It has helped that a lot too.  

No side effects for me except good ones!  The only reason I cannot give this a 10 is that I have only been on it for a month.  Hopefully these results last!"
