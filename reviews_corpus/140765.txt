"Started Cipralex 10mg 7 months ago. First few weeks side effects were not enjoyable, but I stuck with it. Within a month not only was I noticing feeling better, but friends and family were also noticing I had a better overall mood. Last few weeks, I have had my DR up my does to 20mg a day, due to starting to feel the same horrible mood I did before starting. See to have build a small tolerance. In terms of anxiety, this medication has 0 effect in helping me."
