"My very first time to try this medication . I thought I was gonna die ! I took it last night at 7:00pm  went to bed by 10:00 pm and I was fine. I woke up at 6:00am and I went straight to the bathroom had a bad diarrhea plus vomiting . Had to drive to work with major diziziness. And had no appetite at all. I felt so weak. I was thinking maybe it needs more time and to be more patient. Till around mid day today I had to leave work because I was so nauseous that I can&#039;t function. I called my doc and she told me to stop taking it! This medication is definitely not for me. I&#039;ve tried a lot of anti depressants like this one !!!! "
