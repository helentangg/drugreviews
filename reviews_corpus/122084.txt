"4 months ago I suffered my first depression in my life (male, 66 years), for which my physician gave me 15 mg Mirtazapine, later on increased to 30 mg. My sleeping improved instantly, but not so my depression. Therefore the psychiatrist prescribed (in addition to 15 mg mirtazapine) 75 mg of Venlafaxine (extended release) during the first week and 150 mg during the next 3 weeks. By lack of sufficient improvement of my mood this was further increased to 225 mg some 10 days ago. Now I see a slight improvement. I had no side effects from the mirtazapine and hardly any from the Venlafaxine (just occasionally a dry mouth during the night and a slow stool, but not really problematic). Now I wait for a further mood improvement. Evaluation on Jan 27."
