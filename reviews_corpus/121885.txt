"I was put on Effexor 37.5 for hot flashes.  I had uterine cancer and went into very fast menopause.  After trying to live with the hot flashes for about 6 months, I asked for help.  Effexor has been wonderful. I am now able to sleep through the night.  I really only have a hot flash when I forget to take my medicine."
