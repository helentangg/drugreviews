"I was prescribed Cymbalta for arthritic pain in my knees. I took 30 mg/day for 3 days and was fatigued to the point of not wanting to do anything but lie down.In addition (to which I found out was a rare side effect) I was yawning all day and evening. After reading about the difficulties that some people had getting off this medicine. I stopped it after the 3 days. Unless I can be somewhat assured that the side effects are temporary I would rather live with the pain then take this medicine."
