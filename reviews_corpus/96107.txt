"Do these SSRI&#039;s actually work for anxiety? I have tried a few over the last year with little success and horrible side effects. I took Zoloft 100mg for 3 months and noticed a very slight decrease in anxiety. As with all SSRI&#039;s I had the standard intolerable side effects including: Loss of emotions, loss of sex drive, decreased motivation, etc... I don&#039;t think SSRI&#039;s should be the 1st line of medication as personally none of them worked for me and all had intolerable side effects."
