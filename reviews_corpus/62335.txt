"I&#039;ve been on citalopram for about 8 weeks. The first 4 weeks I was on 10mg and I could notice a difference in myself but felt I needed a stronger dose because my anxiety was still there. I&#039;ve been taking 20mg which is much better. I feel calmer and don&#039;t get as anxious as I was. The reason for going on this medicine is because I started getting anxiety before leaving the house. I started getting obsessive about making sure plug sockets were switched off and the cooker was off. I struggled with social situations and I used to panic before leaving the house for work which would upset my stomach. I did suffer some side effects with this to begin with: 
Very tired yawning a lot. 
Low sex drive (failure to orgasm)
Loss of appetite."
