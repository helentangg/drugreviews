"Pretty sure I&#039;ve had an anxiety issue my entire life. I&#039;m in my late 20s and it was starting to affect my job. Been on escitalopram 10mg for 6 weeks and have not once felt like I was going to have a heart attack. I take it at night. First week I had every side effect listed. My jaw clenched for probably 3 weeks. I feel like I&#039;m able to focus more and don&#039;t feel as flustered all the time. I also dont feel like im crawling out of skin when surrounded by large amounts of people. Things seem okay for now."
