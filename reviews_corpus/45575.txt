"I&#039;ve suffered most of my life with a condition I thought was just one of those things.  My mother took me to the doctor when I was in my teens and asked her to do something with me. In those days I was given Vit B complex, which did nothing.  In my 40s the condition worsened again, and thinking nothing could be done, I ignored it.  Out of sheer desperation and knowing that this really can&#039;t be normal, I approached my GP and was put on this medication.  I didn&#039;t think it would work, it&#039;s an anti-depressant, how much difference could it make?  I&#039;m 2 months in and I wish I&#039;d gone to my GP years ago. If you are reading this and wondering about this medication, then please at least try it.  I have my life back and I love it."
