"I requested this medication from my PCP for some mild-moderate anxiety.  I heard wonderful things about it and didn&#039;t think twice when I started taking it. I took it for about a week and it was the worst experience of my life.  I had tremors, insomnia, couldn&#039;t eat, spasms, restless but didn&#039;t want to do anything.  I wasn&#039;t depressed in the least prior to starting this medication but after the second dose I felt a depressed.. it was unbearable.  I was then prescribed Prozac and had a similar reaction. I lost 15lbs in 3 weeks. "
