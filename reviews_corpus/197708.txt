"I don&#039;t know how I have lived for 34 years without this medication. Pristiq has for me been a God send. I am now 5 weeks in, and have never felt this clear and focused. It&#039;s not a miracle worker, the situations I face daily still get me cranky and stressed, but I don&#039;t seethe anymore. I used to get angry with my kids for being &quot;naughty&quot;, and stay angry for ages, just getting worse and worse. Now I take the time to be a &quot;Mum&quot;, talking to them and not stressing about the little things they do. As for side effects, I had a little nausea, and irritability (which I still have at times, but I have 4 kids under 4, and my husband works away from home) but overall it&#039;s much more pleasant in our house. Good luck to everyone."
