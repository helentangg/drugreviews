"Has been highly recommended as a true life saver, reading through these posts have confirmed this. I have been on 10mg for two weeks, and just upped to 20mg today, which is a more therapeutic dosage. People are quick to judge the medicine due to its side effects, which will completely subside after a few weeks. I had no side effects, and so far so good really, still a lot to go but my anxiety was crippling, and the depersonalization I had was so intense I didn&#039;t know who I was or what planet I was on for months. Wish there wasn&#039;t such a taboo with these types of medicines, and wish I had started earlier, basically I&#039;ll do whatever it takes to get my life back."
