"Difficult personal situations caused my Ativan usage to creep up to 3-4x/day. When I started being perimenopause, I was also suffering with terrible depression, which I have never had before. My GYN prescribed Lexapro, and I&#039;ve always been against taking an SSRI because of the side effects and feeling like I could just &quot;work through&quot; the anxiety, but the depression was debilitating. I forced myself to take the first pill, and the next day, I realized I wasn&#039;t under a cloud of stress anymore. It worked well for about 3 weeks, and then I was irritable and the anxiety was back. I just started on 20mg and feel optimistic. Only minor side effects: headache, some nausea the first few days, insomnia. I&#039;ve lost weight, which is a plus!"
