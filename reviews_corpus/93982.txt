"After 3 days of 5 mg, I&#039;d had enough of this RX. Being knocked out during the day for 1-4 hours, but only sleeping in 2 hour increments at night, with violent/disturbing dreams, even waking with auditory hallucinations. The nausea wasn&#039;t extreme, but the overabundance of gas build up was too much for me. My depression only worsened because of the sleep deprivation."
