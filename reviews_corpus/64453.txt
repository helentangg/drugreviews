Pros: social anxiety gone. Unbelievable. Able to start spontaneous conversations with &quot;strangers&quot;, now able to develop and share deep, intimate friendships. Not hyper self conscious anymore. I joke around and enjoy making people laugh. Sexually uninhibited (with my husband)- seriously, the best sex I&#039;ve ever had, I&#039;m not self conscious at all anymore and I have no problems with orgasm- actually the opposite (best. ever.) Weight loss, 25-30lbs, and I feel light, energetic and happy with my body now. Food! I used to be a horribly picky eater my entire life, now I try new foods without a second thought and enjoy them! Zoloft has changed my life."
