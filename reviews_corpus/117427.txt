"Nortriptyline did not work for me. The first month I took it I gained 15 lbs, the second month I gained 10 lbs, the third month I gained 5 lbs., total of 30 lbs in 3 months and cholesterol way above heart attack level.  I stopped taking it because I still had migraines and because of the rapid weight gain. I have never gained more than 5lbs. I was 120-125 most of my life. I gained 5 lbs after having 4 kids. I gained 20lbs each time I was pregnant and lost it quickly. I still have these 30 lbs that I can&#039;t lose from this damn nortriptyline. I&#039;ve been walking 3-4 miles every day for a month now and eat organic when I can. I lost 7lbs. It&#039;s taking forever. I don&#039;t recommend nortriptyline to anyone. Try something else!!"
