"I was on this medicine for over 35 days. Started with the 10 mg and did feel better, after that 7 days I was taking 20mg and just did not feel great, than 7 days later went up to 40mg and once again did not feel right.  I had more anxiety and started to feel like I was getting ill. I lost 15lbs and and no appetite. The thought of eating made me sick.  So, unfortunately for me this medication did not work. I&#039;m off the medication for 4 days now and I have my appetite back and feel like myself. I do suffer with bad anxiety daily and it does control me but I realize I have to be the one to take control of my life and work at it."
