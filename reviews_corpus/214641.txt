"Before I started taking this medicine, I was having general anxiety all the time. I was having severe panic attacks which made me think that something was very wrong with me. I was going from calm to feeling like my heart was flipping in my chest, having cold and hot flashes, feeling like I needed to go to the hospital, ect. My doctor recommended Lexapro -10 Mg and after about a week on this medicine, I stopped having general anxiety and panic attacks. It was a miracle. The only side effects that I felt from this medicine is constant yawning and feeling nauseous. Those side effects went away after about a week and a half of taking it. Overall I would definitely recommend this medication to anyone suffering from anxiety and/or panic attacks."
