"I was switched from Lexapro to Zoloft 50mg about a week ago and I found it quite helpful for calming my mind from obsessive thoughts and depressed feeling. Now I am on 75 mg and it is further improving my condition. After 1 week, I will be on 100 mg and I am hoping that it will give me more good results."
