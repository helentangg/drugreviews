"I have been on Prestiq for ages, it did not work for me I felt continuously nauseated  I became numb of all feeling and lost who I was along the way.  In December 2015 I had unrelenting vomiting,  this included vomiting back all medication.  After 10 days I was a screaming heap, went to the Dr who prescribe Maxalon for the vomiting, this didn&#039;t work so back I went this time Stemetil, still vomiting by now off Prestiq felt awful for ages.  Gradually I noticed although still feeling nauseated was not as cranky irritable and stressed. I am still struggling with the withdrawal symptoms however, I am coping better without the medication than I thought possible.  Why is it Dr&#039;s do not listen to you when you are on medication for depression?"
