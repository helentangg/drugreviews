"This medication has literally saved my life!! I was severely depressed and had horrible anxiety and almost committed suicide. The first week on this drug was awful and I was very sick....then a miracle happened. After only a couple of weeks I suddenly realised that I felt &#039;normal&#039;, my thoughts were clear and organised, I was able to laugh, focus, I didn&#039;t feel like crying anymore, my fun-loving personality was shining through once more and I became a better version of me. Everyone has noticed and commented, I am now a great person to be around. I am able to work and eat and sleep and function like a normal young woman and it&#039;s all thanks to this amazing drug. It really has given me my life back."
