"Traumatic experience caused me to suffer major depressive disorder.  Tried therapy, didn&#039;t work. Finally tried medication two years later. Doctor prescribed me viibryd. Took my first dose in the morning, by lunch time I felt sick and nauseated.  Had to leave work bc I felt so awful.  
My doctor lowered my dose and I didn&#039;t feel nearly as bad the next four weeks. I didn&#039;t notice a change in my mood.
I went on vacation and forgot to pack my meds  (I know how horrible it is to stop taking my meds) the come down was un real...  I spent the whole vacation in bed too tired to leave.. 

When I arrived home from vacation I took my meds again and I was instantly sick. I began hallucinating and puking, it felt like a bad acid trip."
