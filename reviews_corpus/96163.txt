"I was totally in charge.  Until I wasn&#039;t.  Elderly mother, disabled sister, husband with sometimes unmanaged depression, stressful job, commitments to the community, and teenage child with issues I could not even comprehend.  I lost it:  Some issues with my child were the last straw  Had panic attacks and the most miserable days of my life.  My husband dragged me to my doctor, who prescribed 50 mg of sertraline, along with Xanax as needed.  The Xanax lasted 2 days: all I could do was sleep, and in the short time I was awake, I felt like Jacob Marley, dragging chains of memory.  Several months of the sertraline later, I was better, but still crying and panicky.  Upped the sertraline to 75 mg and it has been a miracle.  Joyous return to myself."
