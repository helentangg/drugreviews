"Had panic and anxiety every day - was non-functional.  Started taking this medicine 2 years ago and it saved me, gave me my life back. Now my doctor wants me to try to wean off to see how I do.  I&#039;m taking only 10 mg per day before bed, but even trying to cut it back slightly makes me feel jittery and slightly anxious.  Am going to try to stay the course and see what happens.  Perhaps it would be easier to just stay on the med, but I know long-term it&#039;s not good.  So, we will see what happens."
