"I&#039;ve been on Nardil for migraine prevention, probably 5 years now. My neurologist prescribed it after nothing else would work, including Depakote and Topamax. My original dosage was 15 mg 3 x day. I tried going off of it last year, 1 pill/week, as directed by neurologist, but it was a horrible experience with 3 weeks of diarrhea, weakness and depression, so cut it down to 1/2 pill/week. Still bad experience. Had to go back on it. Tried again this summer, cutting it by 1/4 pill/week...much better results. However when down to last pill in morning, migraines hit with a vengeance. Have upped it back up to 1.5 pills/day. Plan to try to decrease again, but even slower. Other than migraines returning aggressively, no bad experience this time."
