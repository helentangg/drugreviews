"I was on citalopram for eight months for depression and anxiety. Side-effects such as high fever and cough lasted for few weeks. After that I started to gain weight slowly and I had some swelling all over the body, especially on my inner thighs. I got bruises more easily than before just by pinching. It made me very tired so I had to take it in the evening.

I couldn&#039;t feel the anxiety and panic but I knew they were in the background but I couldn&#039;t react to those feelings the way that I normally would. I couldn&#039;t feel any pain, 
I&#039;d not get tired in exercise even though physically my body was exhausted but I just couldn&#039;t feel it. It&#039;s just a mental painkiller."
