"I am 16 years old and I started to use sertraline about four or five months ago and I have to be honest it did not work for me. I started out with 25mg and it helped for a day and then stopped so I had gone back and had talked to my phycyatrist and she upped my dosage to 50mg and the same thing happened then again my dosage was upped to 75mg and things went horribly wrong...I haven&#039;t ever felt so suicidal be or I had bad rage bursts and everything was bad! I was so sick and everything felt horrible. I went into a rage and tried to overdose in front of my boyfriend. I felt no self control. This made me feel horrible and I hate this medication."
