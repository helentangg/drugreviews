"I&#039;m 56. I&#039;ve been on Prozac for about 20 years. I would rather not take any medication but the reality is that, for me, there seems to be no choice. Like many who have seen their share of shrinks, I tried everything - and then everything in every combination. Prozac is the only drug that helps me.
I have been off of Prozac now for about 3 months. I tapered off very slowly. Thought I made it! But I have gone back to my old miserable self. I hit myself, hard. I want to break everything that doesn&#039;t &quot;cooperate&quot; immediately - a button, a hard-to-open package, or a pen for example. I never feel like hitting another person - just myself. I&#039;m going downstairs to begin my Prozac regimen again."
