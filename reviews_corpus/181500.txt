"I&#039;ve struggled with bulimia (as well as depression/mood disorder) for about eight years now. I&#039;ve been on Prozac three separate times (I quit taking it during my pregnancies) and I stop binging and purging every time I get back on it. It has also benefited my relationships and improved my parenting abilities. Every other medication I tried was just too hard on me, but Prozac doesn&#039;t affect me in any noticeably negative way."
