"So I&#039;ve been on 20mg Fluoxetine for three Weeks, and I never thought I&#039;d ever go a day without binging again/purging. I feel happier, my relationship is so much better. I can go to family BBQs and focus on them and not the plentiful food. Some cons are: delayed or nonexistent orgasm, low libido, yawning. How I look at it is I was much to depressed, hating myself, and bloated from bulimia to want to have sex anyway! At least now I feel much better in my own skin, and I&#039;m so rarely bloated, when before I couldn&#039;t remember the last time I wasn&#039;t bloated. I was insecure in EVERY situation and in all clothing. I suffered for a long time,and to see how much relief I&#039;ve gotten from just 20Mg of this tiny pill is a miracle."
