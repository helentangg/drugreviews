"I was on Zoloft for 8 years and my doctor first tried to ween me off that and put me on Effexor.  It was miserable.  I am sure some of it was related to the withdrawal from Zoloft, but I was eventually able to transition to Lexapro without the same problems.  This medicine made me extremely nauseous.  I had a horrible headache and was so depressed my family cried from being around me."
