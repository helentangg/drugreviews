"I have been on 100mg a day for around 3 months due to bad depression and obsessive thoughts. It worked pretty good for what I wanted it to do....think of nothing.

It did however do some strange things to me:
I had constant thoughts of cheeseburgers and fries. Its like I new I was getting fat but didn&#039;t really care. 
I went from 2 showers a day to 1 shower every 3 days and didn&#039;t care that people thought I smelt.
I went from being a complete germaphobe to basically eating other people&#039;s left overs in shopping centre food courts.
