"I started taking fluoxetine after running through a lot of SSRIs. My Obsessive Compulsive Disorder was so severe it was debilitating. I tried Zoloft and Seroquel as well as, Luvox and Anafranil (Anafranil awful side effects). After taking 300 mg of Zoloft and just not feeling right I went to my doctor and we switched to fluoxetine. I WAS 100 PERCENT better in 5 days. This saved my life. However, please be patient it may take some trial and error to find the right medicine for you. Don&#039;t give up, keep at it."
