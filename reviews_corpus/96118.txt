"I have been on this med for a year now and at first i felt It helped a lot but over the last few months I have been extremely depressed and suicidal so my doctor is adding another medication (that I have not started yet). The only thing I can say I noticed about sertraline is it really helped my anxiety. When I first started taking it I got horrible side effects that had me stuck in bed. I had the spins all day, awful headaches, was vomiting daily and got really tingly hands and legs that caused me not to be able to sleep. Once I got past these side effects my anxiety has improved, though not my depression."
