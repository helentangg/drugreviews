"I first went on Lexapro 10mg in 2010. I was previously on Paxil and Klonipin and while they weren&#039;t too bad I wasn&#039;t myself. I switched to Lexapro 10mg and it immediately helped me. I felt great except for some weight gain. In 2012 I began to get depressed and than due to some high stress situations I had a small panic attack which then followed with the return of GAD. My doctor increased the dosage to 20mg and also added Klonipin. This only made we feel worse. I finally switched to Effexor and Remeron which was better but not great. last year I decided to give Lexapro another shot and it&#039;s been 5 months that I&#039;ve been on it. Unfortunately I have also had to take Adivan and the experience has been horrible. This week I will switch to Zoloft"
