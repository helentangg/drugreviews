"I just wanted to write a review for anxiety, I am 34 year old female, and all the sudden one day I had bad anxiety, that I couldn&#039;t control.well this time it didn&#039;t, I felt nerouse, heart races and just sick to my stomach. So I went to the dr. and she prescribed me Sertraline 25 mgs. Well the first 2 1/2 weeks were horrible bc it made my anxiety worse and I had lots of side effects, I had diariah, hot flashes, and over active reflexes in my leg. I made many calls to the dr. she said I was fine, bc I kept thinking everything was wrong with me. Finallly after 3 weeks I felt better!! Stick With it, also was prescribed Xanax to help in the meantime!!"
