"This medication has been wonderful for my depression. I was lucky and this started working after just a week and a half. My negative thoughts have stopped and I&#039;m not so irritable. I enjoy the company of my family and have a higher libido vs none at all before. I&#039;ve had side effects like nausea to begin with and strange electrical feelings every now and then but it&#039;s worth it to me to continue."
