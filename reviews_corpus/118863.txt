"I love it!  I have only been on the product for about two weeks now.  I had an upset stomach for a week initially; which is now a mild ache.  It has curbed my snacking which may have been from depression, but no weight loss (yet).  A side from that, I have no anxiety or it&#039;s very minimal.  I am taking 50mg and don&#039;t feel doped up.  I even rose my hand and asked questions during a meeting which I never use to do without severe stress and anxiety.  I don&#039;t have the &quot;what if&quot; in traffic and have more confidence in myself.  It kills anxiety if you are a true sufferer, but it also kills your libido."
