"I started with 0.5 tablets a day with no improvement (should be a stage to test any side effects resulted)
0.5 tablets more for every diagnosis.
Kept a level of 3 tablets for longtime
A peak of 4 tablets after 1 year and 2 months due to an sad period of my life
I almost got no side effects and my anxiety kept reducing with less washing action for my clothing and less care of tiny dirt (Kind of dirt that I concern)
However, my mood is still not always good (except those anxiety from dirt). Not sure what matters
But overall Lexapro helps me a lot! At least I have more time to sleep (I used to wash my stuff until 3-4am 3-4 days a week but now I seldom wash, I have my normal bedtime even though I need to wash Sth)"
