"I&#039;ve been on approximately 16 different anti-depressants, of different classes over the past 18 years, &amp; Sertraline has by far been the most helpful drug for me.  The side effects were pretty severe to start with, insomnia, nausea, diarrhea, dizziness, &amp; feeling extremely &#039;spaced out&#039; but I persevered with the drug as I know all too well they can take time to work effectively &amp; after 4 weeks they settled down.  Sertraline has given me my life back, after 6 - 8 weeks I began to feel my depression lifting significantly, I felt a 50% improvement, which is huge to me &amp; 14 weeks in I am starting to function again."
