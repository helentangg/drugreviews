"This medication has turned my life completely around.Depression runs rampant in my family,mostly untreated.I have had low level depression for my whole life,but was very much functioning,if struggling inside.In the past 2 years I had sunk slowly but surely into a very dark hopeless state of mind.I felt deeply,terribly sad,stressed,depressed,hopeless,and for 2 weeks of every month before my period the symptoms worsened to a suicidal state of mind.I eventually went to my doctor who diagnosed premenstrual dysphoric disorder,SAD and major depressive episode.3 months later, 20mgs fluoroxetine a day, I feel &#039;normal&#039; again for the first time in years. Balanced,happy,content and positive.Not numb or disconnected at all.I have hope again."
