"I only took this for a few days and had a terrible reaction.  I lost control of my emotions.  I would start crying hysterically uncontrollably for no reason then immediately flip to laughing hysterically.  It was awful.  I was crying and laughing so hard I had to lay down.  I&#039;ve taken a lot of antidepressants over the years and never had anything like this happen.  It was a horrible feeling and didn&#039;t help my depression either."
