"I am taking this medication on a trial basis while I try to get my health plan to cover it and so my physician gave me a ton of samples and I am a few weeks into my treatment and my boss, my coworkers, my boyfriend and myself all see a change. A fantastic positive one! I did get the nauseous feeling for two weeks but that fades. I have NOT gained ANY weight on this pill. WARNING: IT CAN CAUSE BRUISING AND BLEEDING. I am getting some bruises here and there and I had oral surgery which bled A LOT. But for my depression it is working fantastic. So much so that I am going to fight with my insurance company for this to be added to the formulary. Literally NOTHING ELSE works with me. I was diagnosed with MDD about 12 years ago so this is nice."
