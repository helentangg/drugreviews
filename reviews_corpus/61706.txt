"I cannot believe that this medication has genuinely helped me to start turning my life around. I didn&#039;t recognise exactly how low I had become.

I went to my GP following six months of extreme anxiety due to work stresses, and after a lengthy consultation and blood tests was prescribed citalopram 10mg. 

I experienced some nausea, mild headaches and an increase in my anxiety after a week. So I revisited the GP and my dose was increased to 20mg.I had minimal side effects for a couple of days and then I felt myself becoming calmer, even of mood and generally enjoying the little things that I had stopped enjoying. I feel confident and happy - even in social situations I would normally avoid. I am smiling again."
