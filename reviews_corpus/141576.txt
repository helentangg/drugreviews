"My doctor prescribed 10mg Lexapro for severe anxiety about 5months ago.  The first 4 weeks were really rough as the side effects almost caused me to discontinue the medicine. By the 4th week, I had insomnia.  I couldn&#039;t sleep for several days.  I felt like I was on speed.  So, I cut the pill in half and the next day I felt a difference.  I&#039;ve been on 5mg for the last 4 months. And, I must say that it has changed my life for the better.  I no longer have those negative thoughts or bouts of anxiety. Its amazing.  The only side effects that continue are: clenching of the jaw and weight gain due to an increase in appetite. If you take Lexapro, give it 4 to 5 weeks to work before giving up. Best of luck."
