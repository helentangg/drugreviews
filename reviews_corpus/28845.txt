"I am 38 yr old mother of 2 teenage boys. Depression has plagued me with thoughts of suicide a constant companion. This drug really helped (10mg for me), I am not so worried or bothered by things, I can handle just about anything. I love it, I have been on it 8 months and I want to wean off because of the weight gain (10 lbs) and loss of libido. I tried to wean off before and the withdrawals were so bad, if you decide to stop taking it, see your doctor. I recommended at least a 2 month withdrawal if not more, seriously, it is so bad. The nausea, dizziness and head zaps are debilitating."
