"I love Viibryd! I suffer from social anxiety and occasional depression. I also have pretty nasty PMS symptoms. This medicine has helped me a ton! I am not snapping at my kids, no longer stressed, and does not effect sex drive. I haven&#039;t noticed any food cravings either, so no weight gain like with Celexa! I haven&#039;t had any bouts of sadness either, plus I do have more energy. I did have upset tummy first 2 days, then fine. Definitely take with food! Protein and carbs!! Love it!"
