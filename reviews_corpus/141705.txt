"For years I suffered from almost debilitating obsessive thoughts that ruled my life. I had no control over them. They intruded on every single aspect of my existence, making being present in any given moment virtually impossible, because the thoughts would not let up. About 4 years ago I started taking Lexapro, and the relief, within a few weeks, was immense. Now I can actually enjoy my family, my life. It is truly amazing."
