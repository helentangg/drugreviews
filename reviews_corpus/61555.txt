"Ok Please read this if starting out on citalopram and worried. I have bad OCD and anxiety. I  started taking citalopram in October, started off on 10mg I won&#039;t lie and say side effects are easy but it DOES get easier and they DO go away but it does take time, stick with it ,queasiness , lucid dreams , no sleep ,hands burning up felt spaced out a bit. I was going to give up after a week but they did subside after couple weeks and your body gets used to them so stick in there. Eat before taking them, bananas I found easy to eat when side effects took my hunger ,  if you have to up dose I bought a pill cutter and went up 2.5 mg at a time so now on 20 mg and getting there , please keep at it and good luck to all x"
