"Paxil is amazing. I was a person with severe social anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder. I was unable to leave my room at college. I never wanted to go out with my friends or stay in the library to do my work. It was extremely difficult. 

I began Paxil and within a few weeks I was literally crying of happiness because I am such a different person now. I&#039;m able to go anywhere and do anything I want without a huge anxious feeling. I fully support it for anyone in my same situation.
