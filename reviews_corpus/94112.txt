"I have been on Brintellix for 6 months. Started on 10mg. Initially like everyone else thought it was great with the exception of nausea. It also helped with the quality of my sleep. After about a month it plataued so I went up to 20 mg but it made me extremely tired so I went back down to 10 mg. 5 months into taking this ridiculously expensive drug I felt my personality is completely changing and not for the better.  I became quick to anger, on the verge of tears, (not typical for me), with an explosive and unpredictable personality.  If that was not enough I was also very tired all the time. The personality changes cost me my job and at home well, it hurt people that I love.  Going off of it I was in pain and tears for days..."
