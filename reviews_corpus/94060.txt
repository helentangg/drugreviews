"Been on it for depression and anxiety. It&#039;s only been for about 4 days now but while it does make them go away, I&#039;m experiencing emotional bluntness. I can feel my emotions there a little but I don&#039;t feel them fully. I also keep waking up to sore jaws from the clenching. Sleep is worse as well."
