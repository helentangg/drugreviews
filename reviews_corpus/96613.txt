"I use Zoloft for my depressive episodes due to bipolar disorder. I have unsuccessfully tried about fifteen other anti depressants in the past. Zoloft works wonderfully! With Zoloft, it doesn&#039;t take long for my depressive symptoms to fade. The only side effect that I experience is the complete loss of my sex drive. It is very common with SSRIs. Fortunately, I talked to my doctor about it and he prescribed Periactin to take with it. Periactin is very effective at addressing the issue."
