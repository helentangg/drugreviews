"After struggling with depression for  over ten years and trying over twenty different medications, I have finally found one that works. I have been on this medication for about four years and it has been life changing. I have had no side effects (which isn&#039;t common with these types of medications) The only &#039;negative&#039; thing about this medication is that if you accidentally miss a dose you will get really bad side effects."
