"I&#039;ve been taking Zoloft for about a week now and its made me nervous, dizzy, almost emotionally dead (though that might be because of the Depakote) and has really increased my psychosis to the point of where as an addition to hearing voices I have been hearing music when there should not be any music, oh and dry mouth. I&#039;m going to give it some more time but if these symptoms continue I will stop. I&#039;ve read a lot of positive reviews though and I don&#039;t react well towards many medication."
