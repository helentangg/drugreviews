"I am a 52 year old male and have been battling depression for 30 years.  Back in 1980 tricyclics and MAOI&#039;s were the only treatment of choice.  Since 1987 when Prozac hit the market I went on that.  My depression episodes are brought on by stressful events. Depression also runs in the family.  After 5 or 6 different episodes Prozac no longer worked for me.  So I tried other SSRI&#039;s such as Paxil, Zoloft and lastly Celexa which made me worse.  My new physician prescribed Cymbalta which is an SSNRI which I have been on for 4 days at 30 mg and 1 day at 60mg.  Prior to starting to take Cymbalta I had suicidal thoughts.  In 5 days those thoughts have subsided and have a little more energy.  Still have trouble in the morning.  "
