"Started my dose 7 days ago. The first three days were fantastic, and by day 4, I felt as normal as I have in two years. Now, I am having the racing thoughts, electrical zaps and insomnia. I was struck with some strange illness 2 years ago that no doctor has yet to explain. My neurological symptoms of the illness have been a challenge at best (constant muscle twitches, head fog, stinging sensations, lack of coordination, sleeplessness, etc...). Well all of this took a toll on my emotionally as a man. I have 4 children, a wife and three business. I was put on Zoloft 2 years ago and stayed on it for 6 months, but the sexual side effects and the nausea were too much at the higher doses. Hope I can get through the break-in period and this works."
