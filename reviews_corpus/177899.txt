"I&#039;m 21. Cymbalta works really well with depression. It made me happy. So happy I could lose my mind in myself and forget to do anything but eat and think. That&#039;s why I&#039;m giving it a 5. When I started taking it I lost about 4lbs.... Then... Tada! I gained 14lbs in 2 weeks. I got off the medicine right after this. I&#039;m not going to gain all my weight back to make myself more depressed in the future. Watch out for this one if you&#039;re watching what you eat. I&#039;ve lost 7 of the 14, so at least I have that. But I&#039;m upset by the gain. I was on it for a month."
