"I began taking Viibryd in October of 2011, at the age of 37. I&#039;ve had problems with Dysthymia and nervousness my entire adult life, but I started having panic attacks, depression, and insomnia. 
Within a week after beginning the 20mg dose, I came out of my funk, was able to sleep soundly throughout the night, and panic attacks were nonexistent. 
I recently had a traumatic experience involving my daughter which forced me to take a more structured job in an extremely hostile work environment. The panic attacks returned and I felt like I was slowly losing my grip on reality. 
Three days ago, my doctor increased my dose to 40mg daily and I feel fantastic. No more panic attacks, and I have an overwhelming sense of calm -almost euphoric feeling."
