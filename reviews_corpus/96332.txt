"I started taking Zoloft about a month ago. I started with 25mg and I&#039;m up to 100 now. I didn&#039;t have any side effects, and by the time I was taking for 2 weeks I felt amazing. I was really happy and I felt like I did before the anxiety and panic attacks ruined my life. It is my 2nd week on the 100mg dose, and now I don&#039;t feel too hot anymore. I have pretty severe diarrhea and I have to urinate frequently. My body is obviously trying to get rid of this medicine. I still go to school, I now worry about having an accident there if I can&#039;t leave the class in time. So now my anxiety is back. Also serious If not for the diarrhea, this drug would honestly get a 10. Its amazing, mostly."
