"I started Zoloft around August In 2012, so say 8-9 months. I do remember the first week I tried taking it to bed cause a friend said it may make me sleepy. Well, it did the total opposite so I take it in the morning and it gives me a little help waking up. I have had anxiety problems ever since I was in elementary school and I can tell a difference. I&#039;m a student, so I&#039;m always stressed but Zoloft makes me stop worrying about it. It helps me feel more normal. I may possibly need to have a higher dose but overall, it&#039;s worth a shot to try!"
