"I was on this med for 5 days and decided to stop. I was feeling worse than ever - dopey, sick and with terrible headaches....have been off for 4 days and feel better for it. Have decided to try other ways to sort out my anxiety/body pains rather then being drugged to the eyeballs. I could have given it a bit longer but my gut feeling is this drug (like most other SSRIs) just masks the problem. Am now trying Claire Weekes book &quot;Hope and Help for your Nerves&quot; to get to the bottom of my anxiety. I feel really hopeful, as, deep down, I know it&#039;s just my thoughts that are causing my problems. If I can rid myself of anxiety, then my body pains should disappear. Here&#039;s hoping."
