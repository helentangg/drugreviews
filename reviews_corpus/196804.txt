"I thought nothing could stop my panic attacks I had several a day for no apparent reason. This medicine has literally saved my life I&#039;m on day 8 and although days 1 to 5 were difficult I now feel &#039;normal&#039;. I feel nothing could set me off panicking - I&#039;m happy. It&#039;s hard at first but please stick with it"
