"I&#039;m 44 and starting getting migraines about ten years ago. I&#039;ve tried several migraine medicines with no effect other than making me even more nauseated. My Doc suggested amitripyline and it works great!  As soon as I feel an occurrence I take 1 and 30 min later I&#039;m good to go. Although it does knock me out I am very grateful for this med."
