"I was prescribed anti-depressants for menopausal symptoms, then came the anxiety.  My doctor prescribed Venlafaxine. At first it was great, but over the years I am have so many of the side effects of this drug. I didn&#039;t realize until now that having difficulty swallowing was a side effect. I&#039;ve gained weight and can&#039;t lose it. I&#039;m not at all the person I was before. Missing a dose required me to call in sick from work, not to mention how terrifying it was.  This drug is wrecking my body!! I&#039;m weaning off. Anyone that has done this, please help!  Seeing my Dr.
Gotta get off!!!"
