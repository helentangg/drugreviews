"I am currently one month in and Pristiq is a life saver!
After about an hour I felt energized and extremely optimistic.  I cleaned, got out of bed, and wanted to do stuff for the first 3 days.  Then from 3 days- 3 weeks it was really bad.  I had massive mood swings.  I&#039;d be feeling really good and then VERY VERY horribe and low.  I felt suicidal, angry, and my self esteem was super super low.  I&#039;d also have anxiety attacks.  Then, after about 3 and a half weeks, it just started working. I felt really really good! I got up and hung out with friends and started doing things!  My anxiety was completely gone.  Symptoms I&#039;ve had are increased appetite, headaches, and stomach pains.  

Definitely give this medicine a chance and give it time to kick in."
