"Just started taking Venflaxine for my anxiety. It made me very I&#039;ll,  I was nauseas and vomiting for 2 days. I stopped taking the pill and felt 100% better. I think everyone reacts differently to certain medications, if you are someone with a sensitive stomach just be aware you might have this reaction."
