"I was just prescribed this yesterday. I&#039;m starting at 20mg. After my first dose, I already feel better. I had a peaceful calm feeling. I&#039;ve tried every ssri except for paxil and i think I&#039;ve found the one. I switched from luvox. It was ok but felt like something else would be better. Especially because of luvox side effects. The other plus to celexa is I&#039;m not hungry. I&#039;ve gained 30lbs previously from zoloft. I&#039;ve lost some since stopping. I&#039;m hoping celexa continues to help with weight loss.

I&#039;ve got a good feeling about this."
