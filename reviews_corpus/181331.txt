"I&#039;ve been on 10mg fluoxetine for just over one week - I did take it for a few days a little while ago, it made my IBS worse, so I stopped. My doctor persuaded me to give it another go. I know it&#039;s early days, but so far it&#039;s all bad! Before I was  tired, unmotivated, no concentration, barely able to wash or do the simplest things. Now - I&#039;m like  the walking dead! Even more tired, even less motivation,  brain fog - you name it. And possibly more  depressed! I also had terrible joint pains - I have arthritis anyway! The joint pains seem to be lessening, the others aren&#039;t- so far!  I just hope it&#039;s a case of getting worse before it gets better, cos atm it&#039;s almost unbearable!"
