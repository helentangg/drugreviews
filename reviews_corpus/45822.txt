"I&#039;ve been taking this medication for 20 days. I started taking it because of severe anxiety and depression. I started on 5 mg and within the last 7 days increased to 10 mg. The first couple of days I felt fine then I started to feel really anxious.  I&#039;m still feeling alot of anxiety but my doctor insists that I continue the medication and the anxiety should subside.  I&#039;ve tried so many other medicines and this is the only one I&#039;ve tolerated this long. I&#039;m hopeful and pray that the anxiety does go away. I can honestly say that my mood has definitely improved that&#039;s why I continue to take it. I&#039;ll keep my fingers crossed."
