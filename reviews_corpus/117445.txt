"Dose has been Titrated up by 10 mg every 2 weeks. Now at 75 mg a day. Pain of Chemo induced bi-lateral Peripheral Neuropathy is as bad as ever. When dose was increasing pain relief of a few hours was bliss. Now at maximum dose and side effects are as bad as the pain. Have to wait another month to see pain clinic. Dry mouth causing problems swallowing. This is last resort as almost every other drug treatment has been tried over 6 years."
