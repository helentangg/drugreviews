"I have been taking Pristiq for a little over a year now, and I am very happy with it. I am 32 and have been on antidepressants since I was 17. Zoloft worked well for me for many years, then I spent quite a few more years trying different things until I tried Pristiq. I don&#039;t remember how long it took to start working, and I haven&#039;t had any miraculous weight loss, but I feel like a stable, happy, normal person on it, and that is enough for me. The one warning I will add, if I miss even a day or two I have SERIOUS withdrawals. Depression, obsessing, lots of crying and just generally coming unglued about anything and everything. This is not how I feel or act when I am not on medication, it is definitely a withdrawal, so take with care."
