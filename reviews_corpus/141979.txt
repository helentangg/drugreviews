"I&#039;ve been on Lexapro for 2 years and am now weening myself off.  I am giving this medicine a relatively high rating because it saved my social and academic life in under a month of beginning treatment.  However, after being on it for about 2 years it&#039;s effects have plateaued.  I am completely emotionally neutral to any situation.  Some may like this feeling, but I do not.  Example:  I get a D on an important term paper.  Emotion: I don&#039;t care.  Example: I get an A on an important term paper.  Emotion:  I don&#039;t care.  I&#039;d at least like to feel something from emotional stimuli.  I will either be trying a different drug or giving a completely drugless life a chance.  Good luck to you all."
