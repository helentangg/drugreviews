"Started in 10mg per day of amitryptyline for daily jaw pain due to clenching teeth during the night. Was waking up everyday in agony. 10mg seems to have stopped the jaw pain however was still waking up with terrible headaches every day. Doc increased dose to 20mg. This had stopped the headaches too. Also suffer from migraines. Not had one of these either "
