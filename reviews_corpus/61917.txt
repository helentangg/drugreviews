"This is my first time taking a mental medicine and this is my second day. Ive been pulling my hair for about 9year. Never thought it was a disorder until my mom told me. I had the urge to pull my hair but after i took one, the urge stopped. But my teeth and my hands shivers time to time. My stomach feels like its twisted and feels like something is stuck in my throat. I also cant feel excited like before and when i try to do something fun, i get bored right away. My doctor told me to take 1/2 of the medicine for the first week, and then one whole after. I got 20mg tablets. Taking 10mg and feeling that my interests lost, im really scared. If i take the whole medicine, what will happen to me? Im not sure if this medicine is good for me but ill continue taking them. Plus, my mom is really happy that im taking it."
