"I was on Celexa for a year and a half due to post partum. I slowly weened off it and was off for 6 months before the depression came back. I was then put on Pristiq. Big mistake. After 4 days, my pupils were dilated and I had sweats daily. I ended up being admitted to emergency and they said I had serotonin syndrome. Too much for me. "
