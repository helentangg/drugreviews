"I was experiencing severe hot flashes and uncontrolled emotions, crying, angry, and very tired from lack of sleep.  I consulted with my doctor and she put me on paxil.  I was confused as I am a quiet and always a hard worker with no real problems with depression.  Doctor explained that it helps with hot flashes.  I am on 10 mg a day that I take a bedtime.  I get very tired, yawn all the time, still not sleeping the best, I clinch my teeth together all the time so they are sore, food is not appealing so I barely eat, I do not want to talk to anyone, do not want to work either, no energy and no sex drive.  I am told that I will get more adjusted to it and things will right themselves.  It has only been 1 1/2 months I will give it a few more."
