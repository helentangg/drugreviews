"I have been on Elavil for 3 months now and it has changed my life.  Immediately before starting the medication, I had dizziness, nausea, jaw pain and migraine like headaches with light sensitivity for 3 solid months.  I had suffered with these headaches since my early 20&#039;s but I had never had one long nonstop migraine for 3 months before.  I have only had the beginnings of one small migraine (flashing lights) in the past few months and that correlated with missing a dose of the Elavil the previous night.  I take one 25mg tablet at bedtime for migraine prevention.  I sleep well, feel great and my mood is elevated, all because I don&#039;t have those debilitating headaches which were ruining my life."
