"I&#039;ve been suffering from depression and GAD since 2000. It was pretty bad and I was immediately put on Paxil but also tried Welbutrin, Celexa, and Trazadone. The last three didn&#039;t really work for me but Paxil in combination with Clonazapam did help me after a period of time. I had some good stretches and some bad ones. In 2010 my doctor suggested Lexapro at 10mg. It was amazing. I felt great and I didn&#039;t need the clonazapam. This lasted for about 2 years but then a few stressful situations made my anxiety and depression come back. My doctor increased Lexapro to 20mg and also put me back on clonazapam. I was on this for about 2 months with no relief. Either my anxiety and depression were quite bad or the Lexapro just pooped out."
