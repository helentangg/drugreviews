"I had tried Lyrica for fibromyalgia &amp; it made me severely tired, and didn&#039;t help the aches &amp; pains at all. Once I switched to Cymbalta, I felt great!  The aches &amp; pains were reduced by at least 75% within 2 weeks! I&#039;ve been on it 1.5 years &amp; have had a gradual weight gain totaling 20lbs that started the same month I started the Cymbalta. My rheumatologist says its not Cymbalta related, but I&#039;m thinking of maybe trying another medicine just to see.     But I&#039;m afraid nothing will work as well as the Cymbalta. I also take 250mg Soma at night to help me sleep which works great."
