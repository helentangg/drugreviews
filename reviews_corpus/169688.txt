"I finally saw a neurologist after years of headaches.  I have taken Topamax and Neurontin as preventatives.  Zomig, Imitrix, Maxalt, and with stress seem to never go a week without a headache.  I was started on 25 mg Elavil with no relief, it was increased to 50 mg at bedtime and I have been nearly headache free for 3 weeks.  I did miss one dose and had a headache the next day but not the rebound headaches that I was experiencing.  

The side effect that bothered me most was the dry mouth and I did experience fatigue.  I am a RN and work 12 hour shifts, there was no way I could work with a headache and would subsequently miss work.

My fingers are crossed and I am hoping this is my cure. Yay!"
