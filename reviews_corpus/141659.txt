"I found this the only thing that really helped me. Have been on 20mg on and off for past 7 years. Unfortunately my system has now built up a tolerance so I have to change but for anyone with anxiety or depression or panic attacks. Give this a go and give it time to work.
I had no luck on 10mg or 15mg but the 20mg was a life saver."
