"I&#039;ve been on sertaline now for nearly a month I&#039;m on 50mg, I suffer from just general anxiety. Since starting these tablets I lost a lot of weight in the first week along with feeling depressed and fatigue. I soon got my appitite back though. Recently I have been suffering with a bit of social anxiety kinda getting anxious about going outside and feeling anxious? May sound silly! With this medication you have to work around it and give it time. Work with the medication.. Eat good, sleep good (if you can) and listen to music and do anything that makes you happy. I really hope I see some more improvements soon as I&#039;m out of work and being 18 in missing out on going out and seeing my friends because I don&#039;t feel like I can at the moment!"
