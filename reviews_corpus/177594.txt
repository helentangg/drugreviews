"I took cymbalta for years before and always loved how good I felt. Because of life changing circumstances I had to get off of them about 3 years ago. I did well for a year then all my symptoms came back like a trainwreck!  I have bipolar 2 now along with GAD. I was going crazy mad all the time ,anxious, depressed couldn&#039;t remember where I was or days at a time. I finally had enough. I hadn&#039;t felt this bad since I was in my 20s I&#039;m now 40. I was put back on cymbalta starting at 20 mgs a day the side effects are minimal to how I felt before the worst thing is the stomach issues but you have to keep on them the future benefits are amazing it&#039;s been 9 days I already feel good!"
