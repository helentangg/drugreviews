"Ever since my 1st panic attack almost 3 years ago I could never feel the same. I couldn&#039;t sleep, would feel overstimulated if I came into contact with too many people or a stranger for too long a time period. I always had a constant tingling on the side of my head with no explanation of origin I had 1, 2 MRI&#039;s and a CATS scan. I had brain scans I was sure I had a tumor somewhere and I was dying. Everyday my normal activities were crippled by this anxious feeling I wasn&#039;t my normal outgoing self by any means this lead my anxiety into a major depression I felt broken unfixable like there was no explanation to my condition, I thought I was losing my mind. I strongly recommend escitalopram. Been taking it for a month and I feel like the old me."
