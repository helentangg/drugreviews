"Using Trintellix for 2.5 months and I feel transformed. It breaks my heart to see how difficult these medications are for those on this blog. I&#039;ve always been a half empty person. Go figure. I&#039;ve done OK with my career and my relationships. But everyday felt like a battlefield, another day of struggle and woe. I went to my doctor and ask for a dopamine booster. Trintellix is what she prescribed. I had a sense a dopamine booster would help since I like drinking and alcohol stimulates the production of dopamine. As does weed. Now with Trintellix I don&#039;t need either of those, and my have passion and energy for living has returned, something that I thought was long gone (I&#039;m 65). My only side effects have been a little dizziness, but temporary."
