"I have taken over the counter sleep aid for 7 years and the past year they stopped working for me and I would fall asleep but would wake up several times a night and it would take me 2-3 hours to go back to sleep so I asked my doctor for something better and she started me on this medicine 25mg a night at bedtime for sleep and pain and I&#039;ve been taking it for 2 weeks now and I sleep so good and if I wake up I go right back to sleep and I wake up in the morning with no pain and feeling refreshed."
