"I LOVE Prozac. I have major depressive disorder and general anxiety disorder. I was on Lexapro for half a year, and despite not being a teen or young adult I had my first ever suicidal thoughts. On the Lexapro I felt sedated, I gained weight, and I was still depressed. It did help with anxiety, but instead I was often nauseated. 
Now after 2 weeks of Prozac, world of difference. I&#039;m smiling, motivated, looking forward to the near and distant future. I still have some mild nausea, and it&#039;s not as good with the anxiety or insomnia. Still, it&#039;s great for me because I&#039;m motivated and energetic enough throughout the day to make myself tired enough to sleep, and I&#039;m better at dealing with stressful things."
