"Without a doubt, this medication changed my life. I have dealt with social anxiety disorder and generalized anxiety for the past 15 years or so, and have tried every kind of cognitive behavioral therapy I possibly can, without noticeable results. Reason for this being that I could&#039;t take the information I was given and use it because my anxiety was so out of control. I never realized how much anxiety I truly had until this medication kicked in. For the first time ever I&#039;m able to hold conversations with people and have my own personal opinions on things, rather than coming up with opinions that work to please other people. Yes, the side effects for the first 2 weeks are hard to bare, but if you stick with it you will likely not regret it."
