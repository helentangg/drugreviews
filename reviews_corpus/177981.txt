"Cymbalta is a wonder pill for me. I was in a car accident almost a year ago and still suffer from neck pain. My GP refused to prescribe me any pain medication that worked because they were narcotics. I was depressed from the pain and the effect it had on my work performance and romantic relationship. I begged him to take the pain away and swore I didn&#039;t want to get high. He referred me to a psychiatrist and he put me on Cymbalta. My pain dropped from 7/10 to 3/10 with Cymbalta. It took two weeks on 60mg to kick in, but once it did, wow the difference was incredible. I&#039;m thinking that in a few more weeks my pain may drop even more. The best part is there are NO side effects for me!"
