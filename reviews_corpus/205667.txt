"Am a 41AAF. I&#039;ve taken Pristiq for five months. I begin using Pristiq for menopause. It really help me with the mood swings, depression and even weight loss. The problem is the sweating. I mean I really sweat. I like the Pristiq but the sweating is just like having a hot flash. I really don&#039;t know what to. I don&#039;t want stop taking the Pristiq but the sweating can be very embarrassing."
