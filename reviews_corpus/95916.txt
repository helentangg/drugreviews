"It was crazy how much Zoloft really helped me with anxiety &amp; depression. I did stop taking it though because I began to realize after being on it for about 6 months that I felt like I didn&#039;t have feelings anymore about anything. That scared me, so I quit taking it. Now that I&#039;ve been off of Zoloft for a month and a half, I&#039;m really struggling with anxiety at work again so I do plan to get back on it."
