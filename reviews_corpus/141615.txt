"To make a long story very short, I&#039;ve been struggling with perfectionism, chronic stress, anxiety, compulsive thinking, depression (Especially with nightfall)  and a fear of sleeping.  There has been a wide variety of physical manifestations such as Irritable bowel, fatigue etc..... So over all it&#039;s been a real nightmare.  

The 10mg dose of Lexapro was to high for me and I had a bad reaction my first time.  I&#039;m now on 5mg and so far it&#039;s relieved just about all my problems but my memory is clouded, takes more time to orgasm and I space out a lot.  To have the most success with feeling better you need to also make an effort to change your life.  Just keep that in mind."
