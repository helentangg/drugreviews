"I have been suffering from Obsessive compulsive disorder since I was 18. It was not until I was 26 did I discover that I had OCD. I have been on Lexapro for about 5 years now and it is still working, though I have kicked up the dosage a little bit. In short, it SAVED my life. First few weeks on it can be tough, but don&#039;t get discouraged - take Xanax if you spike during the initial phase of taking it. But once it kicks, no need for benzos, the medicine worked wonders. I was actually taking a pretty low dose.  Around 15mg per day, then I tried to taper off to 10mg, but didn&#039;t work.  I am back up to 20mg. I hear that anywhere between 20mg and 40mg is a good dose, so I will stick with the low-end since my symptoms are under control even after 5 years."
