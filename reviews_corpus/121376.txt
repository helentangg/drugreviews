"This medication has helped me out a lot with depression and ruminative thoghts. It has made me feel less anxious and much happier. I get depressed less and less. I have been on this med for 6 months now and it has helped give me the energy to be happy. Give it a shot! 

Only negative side effect for me has been night sweats. Missing a dose hasn&#039;t cause any problems for me."
