"Psychiatrist put me on Brintellix about 7 weeks ago. 10mg for the first 3 weeks - which had no effect on my depression, but I didn&#039;t notice any side effects like I had with Pristiq, Lexapro, Lovan &amp; Alprazolam. The dosage was upped to 20mg for the next 4 weeks. Still feel terrible, haven&#039;t noticed any shift in the depression but I&#039;ve noticed I feel a bit more edgy and anxious. Not sure how long I&#039;m meant to wait to notice a change but I&#039;m not convinced that this drug is working for me. It&#039;s also not covered by medicare in Australia, so quite expensive!"
