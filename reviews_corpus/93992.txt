"My psychiatrist wanted to get me off Effexor, which was making me extremely irritable and hypersensitive. He weaned me off of it VERY quickly, while he had me start taking Trintellix. That first week was pure hell - and I know it&#039;s because of the fast weaning of Effexor: horrible digestive issues, mood swings, random crying spells, etc. Now, I&#039;m now into my 5 th week on Trintellix (for MDD) and clonazepam (for anxiety), and I can definitely feel myself starting to &quot;level out.&quot; I don&#039;t have major mood swings, no crying spells (thank goodness), no physical side effects, and I&#039;m not so sad about things. But overall, I still feel depressed. So I&#039;m hoping he&#039;ll increase my dose at our next appointment. So far, it&#039;s looking good. Will update."
