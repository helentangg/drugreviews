"I&#039;m an on day 16 of Paxil 10mg. For the past few months I have suffered from increasingly more frequent panic attacks and got to the point where I was afraid to go more than 20 minutes away from my &quot;safe zone,&quot; aka my house. After about 4 days of the medication, I felt my anxiety had worsened and almost quit Paxil about a week in. I&#039;m writing this today feeling almost back to my normal self and that&#039;s a great feeling! Hopefully the medication keeps working better til I&#039;m at 100%."
