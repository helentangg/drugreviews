"I was on low dose Cymbalta for 2 weeks and could not handle the fatigue. I switched to Pristiq 50 mg a little over a week ago. My anxiety is 95% gone, my depression..the negative thoughts are gone, I&#039;m not happy but I&#039;m not sad either, my irritability and being easily startled has resolved. I&#039;m able to go out without being anxious, am  returning to work part time in a few weeks. I do feel a little tired a few hours after taking the medication but it doesn&#039;t last, my sleep is a little disrupted, little nausea but nothing I can&#039;t manage, constipation is a side effect but I use Colace (without the laxative), lost 4 lbs so far. Plan to stay on this indefinitely at this point. Just relieved to finally have some relief from the anxiety/depression."
