"I was on this medication for about 3 year for depression/anxiety.  During the time I took this medication it completely numbed any emotion that a normal person would get.  About six months ago I decided that I was ready to discontinue my use of this medication and slowly reduced my doses.  Coming down from this was extremely difficult and painful.  I would have the craziest/scariest dreams, intense night sweats, severe headaches, uncontrollable body shaking and muscle twitching, some nausea/vomiting, but the worst of all the side effects was when my heart would race so fast it felt like it was going to break out of my chest, and my heart would feel like it was skipping beats, and each time that happened I would get an intense head rush."
