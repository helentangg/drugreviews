"I suffer major depressive disorder, anxiety and insomnia, also a recovering alcoholic.
I was taking this medication for years to stabilize my moods.
I found it helpful at 20mg, I did go down to 10mg at one point and realized I needed the 20mg.
I am switching to a SNRI because although cipralex is a good medication, it numbed me out. Not feeling happy, not feeling sad. So the Dr suggested a SNRI (Effexor) because there is less numbing effect.
It did help me in early sobriety thought.
No side effects whatsoever."
