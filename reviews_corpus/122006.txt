"I take 150mg of this everyday for anxiety. I was previously on Paxil for a few years, which stopped working for me. It&#039;s pretty good at helping me control my anxiety, however, if I forget to take the pill by more than 4 hours from the previous day (exactly 8am day 1, past Noon day 2) I get the worst withdrawals: dizziness, nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, insomnia. Then when I remember to take it if I had forgotten, it takes a few hours to kick in and for the side effects to go away. I never experienced this with Paxil. If it weren&#039;t for this issue than I would give Effexor XR 9/10."
