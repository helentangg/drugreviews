"If you&#039;re reading this and feel that deep, heavy depression in your chest that makes you feel empty inside and like nothing matters, I want to tell you that it does get better and to hang in there. It won&#039;t always be like that and you&#039;ll be able to see beauty again, but you&#039;ll need to be patient and kind to yourself. I felt like that for several months before I had the courage to take Lexapro (it&#039;s my first antidepressant) and I truly wish I wouldn&#039;t have waited as long as I did. I worked up from 5 mg to 15 over 2 months and I never experienced side effects, except the first few days upping the dosage where I was sleepy. My libido has increased because I feel well enough now to have an interest in it. Please know that there is hope."
