"I was prescribed citalopram (20 mg) for anxiety. When I first started taking it there were some side effects: excessive yawning, drowsiness, increased anxiety, nausea, decreased appetite. However it&#039;s been a little over a week now and these have pretty much subsided, aside from still being a bit drowsy. As far as its effectiveness, I wouldn&#039;t say that my anxiety is completely cured but overall I&#039;ve felt like I&#039;ve been in a better mood and state of mind, happier. And I do feel that my anxiety has gotten better although definitely not 100 percent. I&#039;m going to give it a bit longer as they say the medicine could take a few weeks to fully work. Overall though I&#039;d say I&#039;m happy with it so far."
