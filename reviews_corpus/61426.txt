"I started citalopram about 2 year ago. I was always on edge. Everything made me mad and stressed out. I started on 20mg. I had a hard time with it at first. It made me clench my jaw and my hands I felt like I was in a fog. It took about 6 weeks before all the bad symptoms went away. I am so happy that I stuck it out. I handle situations better, I have never been more happy. I just started on 40mg now and I will say it makes me a little nauseous. The only down side is that it makes me have a low libido. I will never go without this drug. I just wish I would have had it many years before"
