"On my 7th day of Lexapro I developed a rash on my arms and was alarmed, especially when I read about the possibility of rash being a side effect of the medication.  With my doctor&#039;s guidance I treated the rash as a contact allergy (detergent, etc.) and kept taking the Lexapro. The rash came back one more time but never again.  Lexapro did not give me the sudden weight loss, dizziness, visual &quot;trails&quot;, nausea, etc. of other SSRI&#039;s I had tried before (Prozac worked for me, anxiety-wise, but the side effects were a bit much... Paxil resulted in extreme dizziness and was stopped after only a few days).  I find Lexapro worth the extra money and recommend it even to people who may have had bad experiences with SSRI&#039;s before."
