"I am a 50 year old woman with anxiety, and now they tell me depression, also tell me a lot has to do with hormones and the change of life. Started Lexapro 5mg for 4 days, now on 10mg for the last 2 days. I am also very sensitive to medicines. Side effects are many, shaky, dry mouth, low energy and terrible insomnia. I know I am only beginning, but does the no sleeping improve."
