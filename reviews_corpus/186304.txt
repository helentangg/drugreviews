"Woke me up a little, decreased appetite so I thankfully lost a bit of weight. It gave me headaches in the beginning due to dehydration, but overall, the only other bad effect was insomnia in the beginning. I went completely manic when I went up to 100 mg, but 50 mg worked perfectly for me...that is, until it just stopped helping anymore."
