"My son was a heroin addict which upon learning about it sent me to a very high anxiety level. If he wouldn&#039;t answer the phone by the time I drove home in my mind I thought for sure he was dead. This medicine made me normal again no thoughts like before no crying episodes and just calm. I&#039;m on 10 mg been on it 2 years. Just feeling great"
