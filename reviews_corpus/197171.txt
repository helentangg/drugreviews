"Paxil CR has made a great impact on my quality of life.  I started menopause and was dealing with stressful family health issues, both beginning at the same time.  I begin to suffer from panic attacks and was overly sensitive to EVERYTHING.  I was taking Lexapro which did not help at all.  Paxil CR has been a God send for me."
