"Ok so I&#039;m a 19y/o female and, After a month and a half of super minor side effects (groggy, dizzy, no appetite) cymbalta started to work really well, however about a couple months ago I began experiencing mood swings more and more gradually. Now I have days where I&#039;m in a completely crabby mood  (I don&#039;t want to do anything), or I&#039;m in an ok mood (I&#039;ll go out and try to do a couple of things to build confidence), or I&#039;m totally pissy and mean all day and I cry and flip out. (like literally cry and like threaten to leave him for nothing) My poor boyfriend who doesn&#039;t even understand the medicine (who tries to because he respects my choices) I plan on changing my medicine my next doctor&#039;s visit cuz the mood swings are making it hard to get a job."
