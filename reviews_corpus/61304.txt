"Celexa is my miracle drug!  I&#039;m on the generic Citalopram.  It is the only thing that has worked for my severe anxiety due to adjustment disorder.  I was previously on Prozac which only made the anxiety worse but Celexa calms me and makes me easier to be around.  My moods are much more balanced and I have a joyful outlook on life.  I&#039;m on 20mg and I am so thankful for Celexa!"
