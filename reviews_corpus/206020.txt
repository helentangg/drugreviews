"Wow is all I can say.  I did not realize how lousy I was feeling until I started this drug. I feel so much better. The first two days I was jittery and the first week slightly queasy but I noticed by day two an increase in my energy and desire to do my everyday activities and a DECREASE in my appetite.  I have no desire to binge eat like I do when my anxiety is bad. I have so much more patience with my children. I still have anxiety but it is calmed with Klonopin and I am starting Buspar this evening before bed. The only bad thing is that it has been very constipating for me. I drink prune juice and have added fiber and Metamucil but it is still a problem.
I have taken many meds over the years but I truly find this a miracle drug."
