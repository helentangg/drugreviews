"I was born 1982 and throughout my adult life I have had problems with anxiety. I only really knew the true extent of how bad I was until I started taking 50mg of sertraline a couple of weeks ago.  I went through my life self medicating whether it was alcohol or going for 8 mile runs just so I could relax. I realize now I heard the word &quot;paranoid&quot; pretty often which I now realize is very close to being anxious for obvious reasons.  What strikes me about some of these reviews is many say its taken weeks to kick in. I suppose everyone is different but I felt my life change after 1 hour after taking a tablet.  I now have an aura of calmness in my life. I feel like I&#039;m at peace and living within the moment for the first time in years."
