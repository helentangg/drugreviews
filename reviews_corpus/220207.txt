"My daughter is16. She started getting migraines around age 12. At first they were every 3 months for a year then once a month and this last year at age 15 they became two or three times a week! We tried Imitrex nose spray and once the urgent care gave her Fioricet. Nothing worked. She had severe aura, loss of vision then the headache followed by vomiting. Also once she was given Topamax which had too many bad side effects. She will be going to Germany for one year as a foreign exchange student and I was going to have to cancel that if we couldn&#039;t find a way to get this under control. I took her to a children&#039;s neurologist and she gave her Amitriptyline. It has been an absolute miracle for us!! No side effects &amp; NO more migraines!"
