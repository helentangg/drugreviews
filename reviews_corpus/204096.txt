"Escitalopram at 5 mg once a day has absolutely saved my life. I had severe PMDD -- mood swings, anxiety, etc. My gyno was trying to prescribe a very high dosage, but I got really good advice from psychiatrist to start with the lowest dosage possible and titrate up from that. The medicine worked within 3 days (this fast result from an SSRI is only seen in patients with PMDD). I have never needed to increase the dosage, 5 mg works just fine. The mood is even, relaxed, but by no means, apathetic. My personality has not changed, but the severe mood swings, rages, are gone. It is amazing how a little pill can help so significantly. Side effect: Difficulty in reaching orgasm - although this is not consistent."
