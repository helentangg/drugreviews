"I have been suffering from Irritable Bowel Syndrome-Diarrhea for several years, with pain, bloating, diarrhea and loud intestinal gurgling after every meal.  Gastro doc put me on Amitriptyline started with 5mg and worked up to 25mg over 2 months.  It really works.  I forgot to take it for a couple of days and all the symptoms came back.  It also helps with my neck and shoulder pain and neuropathy from pinched nerves in my neck.  Another bonus is this medication is very inexpensive."
