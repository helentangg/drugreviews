"Celexa stopped working and I was put on Effexor. My panic attacks are worse then they have ever been, my depression is totally off the charts and I physically shake all the time. The irritability is by far the worst part for me. I&#039;m forever angry now on this medication. My friends and family have noticed a big difference in my personality. Definitely getting of of this medication!"
