"I think Viibryd is a pretty good medicine. I&#039;ve been on so many different antidepressants. I&#039;m always concerned about weight gain as a side effect because that to be completely honestest would make me not take it. However this is really good in that aspect and the only side effect I&#039;ve had was diarrhea the first 3 days of taking it. "
