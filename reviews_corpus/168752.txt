"Have been on the medication about a year.  Has worked wonders for me.  When increasing or decreasing dose I experienced terrible nightmares.  I am on a steady dose of 40mg and no problems at all.  Major drawback is price and getting insurance companies to cover it.  Needed to make a difficult choice of do I pay the price and feel good, or do I try something cheaper?  After being on other meds that do not work half as good as this , I decided to suck it up and find a way to stay on it."
