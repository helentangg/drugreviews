"I&#039;ve been taking Cymbalta for about 3 weeks now. I started with 30mg for the first week. I found it worked but not quite there for me so I asked my Doctor to increase it for me. I&#039;m on 60mg a day now which I take in the morning. I feel much better on this dose. I feel happier, much more calm, relaxed, less worry, and I even find myself being more friendly to people in general. I also take 300mg of Wellbutrin in the morning for my depression. This combo seems to be really working for depression and general anxiety. 

Side effects: frequent headaches (I just take Advil when needed) a little bit of increased body temperature and I&#039;m up later in the evening and wake up earlier in the morn. When I wake I&#039;m super wide awake and very clear headed."
