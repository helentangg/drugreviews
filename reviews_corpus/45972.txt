"I have been on Fluoxetine 20mg for the past 4 months. My life has been transformed &amp; most days I now wake up grateful! Thankful for the people that supported me, for God&#039;s help, strength and medication! I went through big life events over the past 2 years and the balls just kept dropping. My main problem was anxiety &amp; not being able to get through these big issues. This lead to depression and finally I couldn&#039;t see a way out anymore. The first 3 wks I had bad side effects. NOW I can say: My relationships has improved, I find it easier to not over analyze, I enjoy my own company, my work performance is better and I ENJOY LIFE. Push through."
