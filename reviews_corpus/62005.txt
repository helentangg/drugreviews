"I have generalized anxiety and I&#039;ve been on this medication for about 3 months now. I saw a psychologist then a therapist for 6 months during my senior year.(I&#039;m a freshmen in college right now.) I stopped seeing a therapist and tried to manage the anxiety on my own. However, it started getting worse the first semester of college. I would always leave the classroom because I felt really anxious. I would cry after class and I decided I needed to do something about it. My doctor prescribed me citalopram 10 mg. I felt jittery and had a dry mouth the first week but my anxiety lessened by a lot. I&#039;m a lot happier now and I&#039;m so glad I decided to start taking citalopram. Hope it helps you too! :)"
