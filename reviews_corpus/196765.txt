"I take Paroxetine (Paxil) 10mg/day. I have Anxiety, OCD &amp; I suffer from daily migraines. Paroxetine has cured me of migraines. When I started the medication I noticed after only the 2nd day I wasn&#039;t getting headaches. I have also noticed an increase in my general well-being, feeling allot happier and more confidant, It has helped tremendously with my OCD &amp; I have less anxiety although it is still there, It&#039;s not as severe &amp; I have not had any panic attacks. I also haven&#039;t noticed any side effects which is rare for an SSRI drug. I&#039;m still early on the medication (only 1 month) so although migraines and OCD has improved, I think I&#039;ll see an even better improvement on anxiety as well over time."
