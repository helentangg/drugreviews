"I have taken this med  for 5 yrs  the problem is getting off this medicine.  It&#039;s has been 2 weeks  since my last pill.  My side effect is I feel like I am floating on a cloud.  I  can not cover my head fast enough because I get disoriented  and dizzy.  Any one have  this kind of reaction  after stopping this medicine  and if so how log did it last"
