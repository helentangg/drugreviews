"I started the dosage as recommended by my doctor at 10 mg for one week, then 20 mg for the next few weeks.  I was coming off Paxil slowly and going on Viibryd.  I had very vivid nightmares with Viibryd.  That&#039;s when I could sleep.  I spent many hours awake with Viibryd, say around six hours per night.  I&#039;m already taking Ambien for sleep, and this medication made my insomnia much, much worse.  Even the Ambien wouldn&#039;t work.  What was even worse is that I felt like I was going crazy every morning after waking up from a very short sleep.  I feel bad enough as it is, and don&#039;t need to feel even worse.  I do NOT recommend giving this medication a try.  I was desperate for relief, but felt worse so I&#039;m back to Paxil until I see my doctor again."
