"I&#039;ve been taking Effexor XR since 2004.  The side effects that I experience are loss of appetite/weight loss and sexual side effects.  However, every time I try another medicine or try to &quot;get off&quot; my medicines, I crash and I always go back to Effexor and it works really well.  So it is a consistently reliable drug for me and I am very thankful for it."
