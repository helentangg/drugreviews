"Cymbalta and it&#039;s generic Duloxetine for me is an evil, highly addictive and deadly poison! It is very hard to get off of. Especially when taken other dangersous drugs and even OTC &quot;harmless&quot; meds.  I am now tapering off safely and very slowly with minimal withdrawal symptoms as directed and with the life saving help. Did you know that cranberry juice and kegle exercises can help with urinary incontinence much more safely that the drugs prescribed for it?"
