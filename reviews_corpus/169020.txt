"Don&#039;t try to quit the 40 mg cold turkey. You will feel no control of your mind or your body. Your arms and legs will twitch and jerk. You will feel scared and nervous because you are losing control of your mind and physical body. I know you are mad at what the medication has done to you but you MUST get up and go take the 40mg and break in half. I just did. You will itch all over, begin to cry, feel exhaustion, embarrassment, your tongue will be raw up the center. My aunt is a doc. She couldn&#039;t believe I tried to do cold turkey. After 30 min I&#039;m already better. It&#039;s sad but don&#039;t go cold turkey and put your body through that. If you go cold turkey, you could give yourself long term effects."
