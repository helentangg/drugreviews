"The medication did seize my anxiety and panic attacks, although with that in mind, I would never use it again because of the side effects. I was empty, emotionless, depressed, had no worries about others, had to fake a smile or laugh, I honestly felt so hollow - it&#039;s not fun. I think I spent more time thinking about death when I was on the medicine than off of it. It may be a great drug to start with helping your anxiety but I wouldn&#039;t stay on this for long. It changed me 100% and I am still suffering the changes. Also, if you don&#039;t have OCD now, it could start to develop during the treatment."
