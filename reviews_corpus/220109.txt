"It was both heartwarming and very frustrating reading all the posts on the amazing results that sufferers of IBS found from this medication.  I suffer from a disease called Chronic Radiation Enteritis, which is a possible late effect of having radiation to my abdominal area when I was 12 -- I am now 53. After only 2-3 days of taking the drug, I became extremely anxious, moody, and eventually a general feeling of hopelessness settled on me that was absolutely horrible.  I have taken the 30 pills as asked, but not only did it not help my gut, but made me generally miserable for the entire month.  So IBS people, I am so happy for you, and pray that something will come along that will help me even half as much as the testimonials I read here."
