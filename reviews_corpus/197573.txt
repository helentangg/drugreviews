"This was the best medicine that covered a wide variety of mental disorders. I took this pill 60mg for 6 years. I was then hospitalized on an unrelated matter and the doctor had me taken off of this, abruptly. That was the wrong thing to do, I fell into a deep depression that stayed out of control for 3 weeks. The longest 3 weeks of my life, I could not function at all. BE CAREFUL WHEN STOPPING THIS PILL!!!!!!!!!"
