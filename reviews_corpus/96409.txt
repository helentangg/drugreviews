"I have severe anxiety and moderate depression.  I have been taking Sertraline for about 2 weeks.  First week I took 25 mg and noticed a lot of side effects.  2nd week I moved up to 50 mg and have noticed barely any side effects which I found odd.  Worst side effect is being so energetic at night and sleepy and tired throughout the day and constipation.  It has given me the ability to control my emotions and seems to make me happier and feel stronger to fight my anxiety and negative thoughts.  One thing that I am really scared about is weight gain although I feel like it has decreased my appetite I feel like it has caused weight gain because my weight has increased 3 pounds since I started it two weeks ago."
