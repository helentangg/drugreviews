"I have always avoided antidepressants because the times I have tried them the side effects have outweighed the benefits. I swore I would never take them again. However several months back I had an incident at work and almost died. I was having anxiety and depression because of this and my doctor prescribed Pristiq. At first it was terrible. I felt dizzy, weak, sick, and had severe sexual side effects. I was more frustrated than before, but made myself keep taking them. After four to five weeks though, I felt a huge change. The side effects went away and I felt better than I ever remember feeling before. I don&#039;t get angry anymore and I don&#039;t take things as serious. And now sex feels better than it ever has. Give it a chance and give it time."
