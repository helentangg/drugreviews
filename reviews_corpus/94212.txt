"Just started Brintellix 3 days ago. Been on effexor xr 225mgs for about 8 yrs &amp; it stopped working. Doctor told me I should be done with effexor in about 10 days. Ugh. I dropped immediately to 150mg &amp; starting to feel bad. I really want this to work but worried the Effexor withdrawal will get the best of me. Anyone else made this transition?"
