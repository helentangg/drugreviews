"I started taking this about 2 weeks ago. I was petrified because I have had been on so many meds for my bipolar manic depressive state of health. So far so good. Had like 3 days of nausea. But that is over. I am more focused and a little more accepting of life. Versus I wanted to end my life. I foresee very good results with this medication."
