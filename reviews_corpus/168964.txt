"Viibryd has been a God send. I was on Zoloft for my anxiety disorder but it wasn&#039;t doing much and the side effects were awful. No appetite, no sex drive, feeling more anxious...it was awful. So my doctor switched me to Viibryd and it was been wonderful! I feel so much better. I&#039;m now taking 40 mg, and I&#039;m able to talk to new people, go to places I&#039;ve never been before and not have panic attacks. My sex drive is back, and my appetite is back to normal. It is truly the medication I&#039;ve been looking for."
