"I&#039;ve been taking 10mg dose for about seven months. What I noticed initially is that my sense of smell and hearing seemed sharper (weird). Also, no longer entertaining thoughts of suicide. I took Zoloft for almost two years about ten years ago and I like Brintellix better. I did have nausea and constipation at first. Now, I still have some weepy times and times when I just feel like giving up (I am a widow of three years), but I also have times of joy and happiness. Mostly, I feel content. I have a sense of humor again. Sometimes I forget to take the medicine for two to three days and I feel my mood deteriorating, but I don&#039;t feel the weird physical effects that I had if I forgot even one dose of the Zoloft."
