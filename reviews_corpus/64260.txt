"Zoloft has made a world of positive difference in my life. After about a year in a toxic work environment, my anxiety started yielding at least one strong panic attack per week. It was getting worse--I went from specific situational triggers that I could predict to sudden, out-of-nowhere panic. I started on zoloft at 25mg, and titrated up to 50mg after two weeks. The first two weeks were a little rocky--although I felt great most of the day, I did notice a bit of anxiety coming on right before the next dose. My appetite decreased (not to a scary level), and I was a bit shaky and definitely a little nauseous. After about two to three weeks, I could tell it was working."
