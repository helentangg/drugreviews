"This medication has been life changing for me. Even after my first dose I was feeling like &quot;me&quot; again which I haven&#039;t felt like in 7 years. I&#039;m much more calm and relaxed about life and when things happen I can deal with them in a positive manner. I will say the one downfall of this drug is the side effects if you miss even ONE dose. I&#039;ve been on it for about 4 months now and I missed my first dose yesterday, which was my fault because I forgot the pharmacy closes early on Sunday&#039;s and was too late picking it up. "
