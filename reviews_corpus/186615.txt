"I really wish people didn&#039;t rate their experience of having taken the pill for one day or less than one week, and here&#039;s why: For my first week, I felt great, and no side effects whatsoever.  Then pretty much the day week 2 started, I was so nauseous I thought I had swine flu, so anxious I couldn&#039;t breathe, and I can not stop crying.  It&#039;s weird because when I was on Lexapro, which also sucked, there&#039;s no way I could cry - I was totally robotic.  Anyways I also can&#039;t sleep and I have headaches.  I am so, so upset about this because it&#039;s like why did I get teased with that one week of clarity and then drop so much lower?"
