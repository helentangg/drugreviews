"Hi everyone,

I experienced extreme anxiety which then lead to panic disorder. It sounds like it basically started from built up stress but, let me tell you my story as I want people to feel more comfortable and understand what&#039;s going on as I have done extensive research on the issue. 

First, anxiety and panic disorder are awful. You feel like you can&#039;t breathe, that you&#039;re having a heart attack, you get dizzy, you feel off balance, you get sweaty hands and feet, you&#039;re not comfortable and always anxious, sometimes you even feel that you&#039;re legs are going to give out. 

If the above feels like you  well I took Prozac and honestly it saved me. "
