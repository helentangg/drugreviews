"I lost my sexuality from the first pill, overnight it went from 100% to 0%. Was told it was a common sideeffect, so I continued using Prozac (called Fontex here i Norway), after a while I didn&#039;t want thouse sideeffect so I stopped using. But my loss of ibido and ED continued. Now 3-4 years later my problems is still the same, doctors refuse to belive me, but I&#039;m certain, I had very high sex drive before my first Prozac/Fontex pill. No I can&#039;t keep my erection more than 5 seconds and my penis often feels numb. This pill should have been illegal. (Sorry for my poor english)"
