"I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety and panic attacks a few months ago and this medication has totally changed my life. I used to be in a near constant state of anxiety and panic, it got to the point that I was having frequent crippling panic attacks. I was prescribed prozac for anxiety and hydroxyzine for panic attacks. The prozac works so well the panic attacks were gone in a week, and I think I have only used the hydroxyzine a few times (it doesn&#039;t really work) I would like another medication for panic attacks (even though I rarely have them, I&#039;d like to have it just in case) however prozac has been absolutely wonderful for anxiety."
