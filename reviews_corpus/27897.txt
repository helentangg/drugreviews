"All I can say is WOW! After the birth of my son, I developed insomnia and anxiety. I placed a lot of pressure on myself to get enough sleep and the result was not being able to sleep. In addition, I have very high expectations of myself. I work from home and was studying at the time. From this, I caused so much anxiety for myself to the point where I couldn&#039;t control my thoughts and feelings. I was prescribed Zoloft which probably made me more anxious and I was on that for a year. My GP switched me to Lexapro 4 months ago.  On this med I feel like a different person. Happy, no anxious thoughts, I am sleeping like a log and am dreaming! I haven&#039;t dreamt in years and it&#039;s lovely! I have had no side effects on this drugs :)"
