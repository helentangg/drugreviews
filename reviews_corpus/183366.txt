"At 29 I have multiple joint pain and 2 ruptured lumbar discs with sciatica and numbness in my arm and foot. Taking narcotics and opioids helped but then my meds were stolen from my purse. Went to my pain doc for something to help with withdrawals and pain until my next refill. He gave me a sample of Cymbalta. I am impressed with the results other than the headaches and increase in appetite. Helps with my morning stiffness and loss of balance and makes my pain bearable. I do seem to get really sleepy when the headaches come on but if I can take a power nap it helps. My mood is much better but I attribute that to having less pain as I have never had depression. I hope the headaches go away."
