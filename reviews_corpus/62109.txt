"Been on Celexa now for a month at 10mg daily.  So far so good. I feel a lot better and a lot more relaxed and calm. No panic attacks or anything like that. It&#039;s been great. Going to doctor in a couple weeks for follow up appointment. Going to see if I can start on 20mg. I feel that will even work better."
