"Was one 60 mg for 4 years, had some relief from panic attack with depression. Had some rough times job related, medical issues not related to above, and doctor increased to 120 mg. normal dosage is no more than 60mg according to insert in med bottle and Internet. After 3 years on this dose it quit working. The withdrawal was the worst thing ever. During taking Cymbalta, I developed diabetes. Withdrawal took 8 months and pdoc gave me lamorigine, an anti seizure med for withdrawal. As I tapered off my diabetes went away! Pdoc denied Cymbalta caused it. I googled it and proof, all SSRI&#039;s can cause hyperglycemia!  I&#039;ve tried everything from Prozac to lexipro. Same crap. Now on transidone and back to having normal feelings"
