"I started with 50 mg, and had about 7 migraines each month for the first 2 months. The neurologist increase the dosage to 75 mg, and I only have 3 migraines in a month. Before I started to take amitriptyline, I had migraines every other day.  The neurologist said the migraines are rebounding and my brain was screaming for Maxalt or Imitrex.  I haven&#039;t been needing to take Maxalt and Imitrex for 3 months now. Amitriptyline doesn&#039;t affect my mood, but I feel my body is retaining water and have constipation too.  I&#039;d rather have these side effects than migraines."
