"Been taking venlafaxine XR for 15 years and all in all found it did what it was intended for, which was to suppress my depression and assist me in coping with life. My dosage amount fluctuated through the years, from 75mg up to 225mg(I think) and I had very little trouble with it, except when I forgot to refill it. I will say that the side effects of stopping Effexor are horrific and a contributor to why I stayed on it for so long. I&#039;m off it now and I don&#039;t know if I&#039;ll ever get back on it again because I CANNOT go through the withdrawal feeling again, at least not with my sanity intact."
