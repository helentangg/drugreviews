"This medication has changed my life. I am bipolar so I take it with my Trileptal (mood stabilizer). I&#039;ve been searching for the right medicine combination for 10 years and I&#039;ve never felt better. I started Celexa 6 weeks ago and It took about a month to feel it working. I had headaches and stomach problems but all that has subsided. I am free from the debilitating anxiety I&#039;ve dealt with my entire life. I feel a sense of hope and happiness I never thought possible for me. I recommend this to anyone who struggles with anxiety, obsessive thoughts, low energy, stress sensitive or depressed. It&#039;s truly been a God send."
