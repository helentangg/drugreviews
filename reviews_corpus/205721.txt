"I have been on Xanax for well over 6 years. I informed my Doctor that my anxiety has been out of control and I didn&#039;t know what to do. I was not at all depressed. (Just TONS of stress) I work over time at a HIGHLY stressful job and I am a caregiver to my 32 old husband that just recently became disabled last year. 
The Doctor sent me home with a 30 day sample and asked me to try it out.  I was VERY hesitant. I came on here and read the reviews a few days later, I decided to TRY it. 
I am on week 2...only complaint is that I am constantly thirsty, hot and not hungry. Stress less and in a better mood over all. Very Pleased!"
