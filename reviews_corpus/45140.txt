"Well my diagnosis is hard to explain... The doctor says that I&#039;m bipolar but in all actuality I&#039;m on a bad high.  I&#039;m always extremely hyper (or anxious) but have all the symptoms of depression! I have  lack of concentration and I am not able to keep things in my head straight,  like starting one thing before finishing the other.  I am now on day 12 of 20mg and almost instantly I could tell a difference when I started talking it. But mind you  I&#039;m also on deprekote and at the same time he upped that dosage by 500mg!  But I&#039;m so much calmer now and I am feeling so much better. And I&#039;m in this for the long haul. The side affects were very minimal for me, out of 12 days just two days my stomach has hurt but the others I really felt very full ."
