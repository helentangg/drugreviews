"After one year of MRI, CT scan, ultrasound exams for unexplained sharp chest pain (neuropathic, possible neuroma) I was prescribed 10 mg amytriptiline to be taken at night. After 2 months this has brought me back to normal having failed wth all other medications including tramadol. No symptoms at all now though it was necessary to persevere as it took about a month to kick in. Worth trying if you have drawn a blank with everything else..."
