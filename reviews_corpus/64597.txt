"I&#039;m 24 years old and have suffered anxiety and Panic disorder now for 2 years. Unfortunately my diagnosis was not made until 6 months ago and before that I was severely stuffed around by the medical profession making my Panic and anxiety that much worse. I&#039;m on to day 16 of this medication and i&#039;m hoping it is yet to take full effect. I have definitely noticed an improvement as I haven&#039;t had a full blown attack for 2 weeks however I still think of them and feel them coming on daily, this may well be a habitual thing though and from what I&#039;ve read it can take 4-6 weeks so i&#039;m feeling hopeful. I had all the side effects but these were easy compared to the panic attacks I was experiencing. I&#039;ll check in soon to see if that switch has flicked:)"
