"I first started lexapro when I had a massive panic attack in October 2015 it came out of no where and after seeing doctors they disagnosed me with health anxiety.. I&#039;m a mum of 2 and I&#039;m always constantly worrying if I have cancer or if that niggle in my leg was something bad... After my panic attack j was put on 2.5mg and the first week was horrible.. Nauseous, feeling Crap and solo tired... After that I started feeling so much better. I&#039;m not on 15mg and very happy.. I started letting anxiety rule me life and it was turning me into someone I wasnt.. I&#039;ve always been scared of the stigma of having to me on medication to get me through life however if it helps me be a happier person and a better mum then I&#039;m more then happy with my decision"
