"Started taking this to help me get off Lunesta. Taking 10mg. For me, it does NOT put me to sleep like a sleeping pill. It makes me very tired but doesn&#039;t knock me out. But, it&#039;s supposed to help with early morning awakening when you can&#039;t get back to sleep. I believe it does help with that.

I find you want to take it early, like at 8:00 p.m. if you want to feel sleepy at 10:00 p.m. Also, you WILL be drowsy the next morning - another reason to take it early. I actually started taking it at 7:00 p.m. to help with the morning drowsiness. 

Again, the down side of this medication is that you will be very drowsy in the evening if you take it early and/or you will be drowsy in the morning!!!"
