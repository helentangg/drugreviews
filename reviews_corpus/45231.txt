"I have had PMDD since 2007 aged 27.
Doc placed me on 10mg citalapram however after 5 years in my symtoms have come back - citalopram seemed to have stopped working &amp; the anxiety came back with a vengance. I tried to increase but the side effects were just to bad.  So the doc has prescribed me 10ml of liquid flx. . It&#039;s only my 2nd week and I&#039;m 14 days into my cycle. Which is where my anxiety kicks in!! I&#039;m hopping that the flx needs time to kick in?
So far though the side effects seem OK"
