"Hi all , I&#039;ve been giving sertraline 50mg and quetiapine 25mg for my anxiety . I&#039;m at a stage of my life now where this is eating me up . I&#039;m 31 and had these issues for about 5 years . They all started after my mum passed away , never suffered before her passing . Everyday I feel I&#039;m going to die of a heart attack , I keep getting these pains in my chest but all the doctors say it&#039;s anxiety . The question is does anyone know what can help reduce my fears because this is effecting my relationship with my wife and my son ..... Many thanks to all who have taken time to read this"
