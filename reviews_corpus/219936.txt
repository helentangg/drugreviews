"I have had Neuropathy in my feet for over 15 years. I take 10mg a day and my feet do not bother me. Without the drug I get a pins and needles or pain feeling in my feet. The Neuropathy preceded a Diabetes diagnosis by about 10 years. It is one of my meds that I can feel if I forget to take it. To date I don&#039;t think I have seen a side effect."
