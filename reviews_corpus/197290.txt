"Paxil worked well for the first few months and then stopped.  My doc upped my dose and the same thing. I took it for 6 months from half a tab to two tabs a day. I gained 15lbs and became more depressed and lazy to the point that I wouldn&#039;t get out of bed. I also had side effects of agitation, vivid dreams, and problems concentrating.  It did not worked great at first but is not for me. "
