"I have taken Zoloft and Trazodone for past 10 years for depression and anxiety and recently changed doctors. She prescribed Cymbalta.  I am on 60 mg and although I have some negative side effects, they are all tolerable. Any medicine you take you will have side effects. On the positive side, my libido has increased drastically and I can once again have orgasms. Guess I am making up for those &quot;lost&quot; 10 years with Zoloft. New life at 59."
