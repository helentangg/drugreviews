"20, female. I&#039;ve been taking 100mg for 18 months I feel a lot better than what I did in regards to my depression but I feel nauseous 70% of the time and if I accidentally forget a pill I feel absolutely awful. Bizarre dreams, incredibly tired, diarrhea and paresthesia. I&#039;m afraid to stop taking it for good because of what it does to me, something I&#039;ll be discussing with my doctor."
