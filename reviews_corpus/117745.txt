"Started taking nortriptyline in 2004 for neuropathic pain, primarily in my legs.  Tried Cymbalta when it came out in 2006 since it stated helpful with neuropathic pain.  It didn&#039;t work; the hives, itching, tingling, and burning all returned.  Back on the nortriptyline; my doctor allows me to vary my dosage from 50-80 mg depending on how my neuropathy is doing.  Very noticable difference when I lower it; thinking I could get by with less because feeling better.  80mg seems to work very well for me."
