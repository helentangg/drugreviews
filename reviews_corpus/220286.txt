"Amitriptyline immediately worked wonders on my urinary tract pain. I am almost afraid to say how well it has worked because I do not want to jinx it, but it has done wonders for me. Not sure about the weight gain. Not sure if it is the Amitriptyline or the excessive calories and lack of exercise that has put on the pounds. My guess is it is probably more likely due to my eating and exercise habits. I sleep better at night with a deeper sleep REM. I, too, have vivid dreams and do sleep longer."
