"When I first started taking this I was feeling great. Maybe a little too great! Everything just seemed amazing and I was so happy. I was previously taking citalopram which made me feel worse than I did before taking medication. Almost unbearable. So starting sertraline made me feel like there was actually something to make me feel better and that I can be positive again. But into my the 3rd week that kind of stopped and I was feeling less satisfied with life again. Very tired all the time. Some days feeling so sorry for myself I wanted to be alone and cry etc. Other days I felt so numb I didn&#039;t feel anything. I wasn&#039;t sad, wasn&#039;t happy, I just didn&#039;t care. still like this now after being upped to 75mg. Did anyone have this? Do I need upped?"
