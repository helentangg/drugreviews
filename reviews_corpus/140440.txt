"Slowly increased over the course of 5 months from 5mg to 10mg.  Its been 3 weeks on the 10 and I still feel a little uneasy at times or an intrusive thought here and there but nothing compared to how I was before I started the Lexapro.  I suffer from MMD and anxiety, symptoms being derealization and depersonalization.   Thought I was going crazy.  The medicine has helped me tremendously!  I just wonder how much longer I need to give myself on this increase........"
