"Effexor saved my life. I never knew what I &quot;had&quot; could be cured. I&#039;d tried other antidepressants but they made my anxiety worse or vice versa. Effexor has given me back a will to live. It&#039;s lifted the fog of anxiety. I take 150mg. My stress level and blood pressure is WAY down. Someone mentioned strange dreams, I&#039;d like to second that."
