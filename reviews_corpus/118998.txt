"I&#039;ve been taking 200mg Zoloft for the past 3 and 1/2 months (started 5 months ago) for (severe) depression and social anxiety disorder as well as other (less severe) conditions. I think this medicine is fairly effective for the long-term, but it was very hard for me to wait for it to &#039;kick in&#039; after several months of taking it. I cannot compare this medication to other antidepressants, but it was pretty good; it was also much more effective (for me)."
