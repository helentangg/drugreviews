"I was suffering from extreme panic disorder, could barely leave the house, didn&#039;t think I would ever feel like myself again. I was put on Celexa and within a few weeks I started doing things that I thought I would never do again. I didn&#039;t think I would be able to go to college but with the help of Celexa I went off to college and felt like myself again after a few months. It was still a struggle at first, don&#039;t get me wrong, it is not magic, but it makes the panic manageable. I would definitely recommend the combination of this and CBT."
