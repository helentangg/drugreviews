"I am 34 years old and have suffered from depression and anxiety/panic attacks, low self esteem, fear of life in general, for as long as I can remember.  I finally hit rock bottom and decided to get help for myself after having serious panic attacks while driving with my children in the car and nearly having a major accident.  I became to afraid to leave my house.  After going on to Fluoxetine, (20g a day) I started feeling better after two weeks.  I have my life back and feel NORMAL at last. My mind is quiet now and I can breath, I can sleep, I can sit and relax.  I feel like a grown up at last and never want to ever feel the way I did for so many years again.  Just to think it took me so long to help myself, I will never look back!"
