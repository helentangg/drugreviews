"Been on this medicine for around 5 weeks, 10 mg. Been the happiest I have been in awhile! I really love this medication, I have finally got myself out of the darker place I was before. So glad that it&#039;s working, and I&#039;m feeling better day to day. Still some anxiety but I can deal with it, depression is completely gone, I can socialize no problem. terrific"
