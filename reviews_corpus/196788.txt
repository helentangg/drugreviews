"I waited a week before braving this for long term anxiety treatment, the side effect put me off but my anxiety is still so bad day to day.

So yesterday I took my first tablet and what followed hours after was the following:

-sickness (was sick twice)
-diarrhea 
-shortness of breath
-palpatations
-worse feeling panic and anxiety than before
-suicidal thoughts (almost took myself to the hospital-but rode it out instead)
-awful nightmares and virtually no sleep 
-shakes


now I feel frail and am laying in bed all day trying to recover from taking the 1 tablet.."
