"This was a phenomenal find! I could not function everyday tasks until beginning amitriptyline. I couldn&#039;t even try to upset myself, or feel worried while on amitriptyline. I went from constant unknown fear and breathing difficulty to floating on a cloud without a fear in the world. 
First few weeks had some challenging side effects. Blackouts, memory loss, numbness in face, lathargic, more sleepy than usual, dry mouth and munchies. All those disappeared after a month or so.
Did try to get off it to see how my anxiety could manage on its own. Withdrawals were pretty miserable. Two weeks of headaches, nausea, irritability, and dizziness.
Did get back on it when anxiety came back full blown. Slowly increased up to 75mg. 
Hope it works for you!"
