"I just started taking Viibryd five days ago.  I switched from Zoloft to Viibryd.  I was having bad headaches and an overall feeling of yuck in the mornings.  I started feeling better at the end of the day when I was going to take my next dose of Zoloft.  I also could not sleep.  I would wake up at night and then couldn&#039;t go back to sleep.  Since taking the Viibryd, I have been able to go back to sleep when I woke up in the middle of the night.  I am a bit sleepy in the morning, but I am feeling a bit better.  I am hopeful about Viibryd.  I hope that my condition continues to improve and my sleeping patterns continue to get better as I increase the dosage and as time goes on. Zoloft did help, but the side effects were too much for me."
