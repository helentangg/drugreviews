"I have Bipolar I with severe depressive episodes lasting up to 16 months. Zoloft was a last ditch effort to improve my depression; I was formerly on Luvox and found it too sedating and less effective after being on it for over a decade. So far, I have had 15 days without severe depression after being on Zoloft for one month. I think it&#039;s working. I am tired but I am not sure if that is the Zoloft or something else as I am on several medications for psychiatric problems."
