"I started taking sertraline 9 weeks ago, 50mg and increased to 100mg. The first days were pretty bad including reflux-like feeling, sleepiness and wanting to stay in bed, so initially it increased my SA. After a week I felt better, overall anxiety vanished including anxiety I didn&#039;t realize existed (when I woke up on Saturday morning still semidreaming I normally would feel anxiety in my stomach, this time I felt like I was in a warm cocoon/bubble). 
However, it&#039;s been hard for me to focus on my work, I&#039;ve been absent minded, it didn&#039;t help with SA as expected and made me apathic &amp; unmotivated. I stopped going gym, reading books(it&#039;s my passion), made me antisocial &amp; want to stay in bed all the time. I&#039;m going to GP tomorrow to change to Paxil."
