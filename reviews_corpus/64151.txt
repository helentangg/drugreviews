"Hi Dears.. I want to share my positive experience with zoloft. Since 2013 I have been suffering from anxiety disorders, was kept on xanax .25 thrice in a day but no significant benefits were observed. Then I consulted psychiatrist he put me on zoloft 50mg after 4 weeks I started feeling better, after 8 weeks I found it beneficial and almost complete relief and I got my life back... zoloft takes at least 8 weeks for maximum relief and is in progressive in nature. So stick with it and give it sufficient time. Don&#039;t give up. All the best"
