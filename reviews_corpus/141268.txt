"I had been experiencing a period of anxiety and racing negative thought processes. This was followed by a spell of depression, so my doctor put me onto 10mg of escitalopram. The first couple of weeks were very up and down, and I felt really tired a lot of the time; also sometimes my moods would cycle very quickly (within a day) from depressed to highly anxious. I stuck with it, as I had read good reviews about it, and by week 3 I began to feel &quot;normal&quot; for the first time in years!! No anxiety, no racing thoughts, no depression. I&#039;ve been sleeping well for the first time in ages. My relationship with my family and boyfriend have improved DRAMATICALLY. I feel like a changed person."
