"I am on day 7 of citalopram and so far so good. I take it at night to avoid any nasty side effects,  which I haven&#039;t experienced as off yet. I have suffered severe panic attacks for year&#039;s and experience bouts of depression from time to time. I am currently taking 3 meds, propranolol,  limotrigine and citalopram, which are working well.  My propranolol is my saving grace which I couldn&#039;t live without,  but unfortunately it doesn&#039;t work well for my anxiety and stress. I am currently awaiting an appointment with the mental health services to change the limotrigine to something more calming for when a panic attack begins. I would honestly say that I am not having any nasty side effects or down periods so far with citalopram."
