"Effexor has saved my life. I had depression and anxiety so bad, I couldn&#039;t function and was suicidal. Couldn&#039;t leave my house, I wouldn&#039;t leave my bedroom or eat for days at a time. Since taking the Effexor, I can&#039;t believe how much better I feel. I feel 100%, doing the things that I should be doing, just like everyone else."
