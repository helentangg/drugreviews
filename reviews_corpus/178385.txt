"As a disabled person on SS, I have both Medicare and True Blue. When the fibromyalgia is treated with 60 mg twice a day, the symptoms were phenomenally changed for the better. However, about 3x a year the insurance makes me cut back to one tablet daily. Within a week my depression worsens and my pain intensifies. It&#039;s a great drug and those who take it, really need it."
