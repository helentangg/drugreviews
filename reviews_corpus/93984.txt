"I&#039;ve been taking Trintellix for about 3 weeks and have been miserable. I know a new medication takes about a month before being able to tell if it works. From day one, I have had a headache, crazy dreams, a constant banana taste and cotton mouth. The dreams are disjointed, overlapping and exhausting. The banana taste is like that artificial flavor like taffy or snack cakes. It is constant, even after eating pickles. I am constantly drinking something to try to get did of the cotton mouth. I have a traumatic brain injury so my brain is wired differently. I&#039;m taking 450Mg Lamictal and 300Mg Wellbutrin and now Trintellix along with it. I have a feeling that I&#039;m going to have to stop taking the 10Mg of Trintellix"
