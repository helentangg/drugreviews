"I have been suffering with anxiety and depression and my Dr. prescribe Prozac but I dislike it. I took for a week and I have suicidal thoughts. So she prescribe me pristic I took it the first day I have jitters and feel so dehydrate. The second day I have loss appetite and also still dehydrate I was still drinking a lot of water. Third day same think as the second but no suicidal thoughts. Just the seven day I felt so sad I don&#039;t know if it is because I mix it with my birth control pills. I am still waiting on my next appointment with my Dr. and ask her but I am happy I lost five pounds. The Dr. said  my loss of appetite was ok , her concern were more on suicidal thoughts."
