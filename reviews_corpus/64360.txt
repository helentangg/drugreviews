"After 2 years on this horrible roller cost er ride and major mood swings my doctor put me on Zoloft. The very first day I tried it,  I smiled more and things that would made me mad (pretty much everything) no longer did. I feel like a new person and the only side effect that I have experienced was a small rash on my shoulder area, but it was gone after three days. I feel as now I can reach my college goals. I pray that everyone could feel this amazing. God bless"
