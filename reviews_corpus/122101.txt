"I was on Effexor ER for 4 years with excellent results. When Effexor went generic, this is the medicine I was prescribed. I&#039;ve been on this version for 1 month, and I&#039;m very unhappy with response. I have high levels of stress and irritability, to the point that I need to avoid interaction with people for fear I&#039;ll say something I shouldn&#039;t at the smallest provocation. I don&#039;t like myself on this drug!"
