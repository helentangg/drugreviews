"Was always stressed and depressed and blew up on people I love, give Prozac 6 weeks, it changed my life. I&#039;ve been on Lexapro and Cymbalta. On 40mg Prozac, couldn&#039;t imagine life without it, everything just goes my way now and I&#039;m super happy, and can think clearly, but somehow am still myself, and with no side effects. It&#039;s amazing."
