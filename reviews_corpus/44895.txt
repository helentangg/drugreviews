"Hi everyone, I have had severe depression accompanied with suicidal thoughts, since I was about 12. I&#039;m 22 now, and sought treatment when I was 17. I tried Zoloft, Celexa, Wellbutrin, Remeron, and even tried to self-medicate with Heroin. Prozac/Fluoxetine, 20mg a day, was a game changer for me. It came with no side effects, and a month into it life seemed so much brighter, and I was given my life back. If it weren&#039;t for Fluoxetine I would be dead by now. I&#039;ve been taking it for 3+ years and no plan on stopping. Please, if you suffer from depression, give Prozac/Fluoxetine a try. It has literally saved my life. Good luck to you all."
