"I&#039;m feeling pretty sick now. I&#039;m extremely sensitive to medicines and am on only 1/2 of 37.5 mg pills. Correlation isn&#039;t causation but my acid reflux (and assorted stomach problems) have come back full force with the start of these medicines. The backs of my eyes hurt and I have a pounding headache right now with nausea. I have eating problems and this seems to have exacerbated them. My body is in starvation mode where I feel cold all the time, lethargic/tired, I don&#039;t feel hungry and that&#039;s not good because my eating disorders dietician would like me to eat to pull my body back to normal functioning. The only good thing is that my depression started to lessen when I got started with them but now, from suffering the side effects, I feel more depressed."
