"I used this three years ago after I was Prego. I had vey bad depression, ocd, anxiety. Not sure which condition but felt all symptoms. Took 20 mg celexa, vitamin D and metformin for PCOS. As a miracle all symptoms went away. Had a few days when they would return but not constant. Just now and then. Did not have to be on meds continous. Was manageable with vitamin d and light, celexa when occurring. I am Prego with second child had some stress with baby and boom all symptoms returned. Exactly like I previously felt. Took 10 mg while Prego did not do anything. Am due to deliver anytime now. Am going to up dose to 40 after Prego. To knock out the symptoms. Am scared it won&#039;t work. But keep reminding myself that my body desponded well before."
