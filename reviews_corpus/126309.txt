"I attempted to switch from Prozac (which I take in combination with Lamictal and Wellbutrin) to Viibryd to get rid of the sexual side effects of Prozac. Despite my high hopes for the medicine, I got progressively worse while titrating from Prozac to Viibryd. After about a month, I sunk until a major depression and nearly had to be hospitalized, so I went back on Prozac. Viibryd seems to be working well for many other people, but unfortunately I&#039;m not one of them. No side effects from the Viibryd, although I wasn&#039;t off Prozac long enough to judge whether Viibryd would be better in terms of sexual side effects."
