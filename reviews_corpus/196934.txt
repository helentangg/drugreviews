"This medicine has the worst side effects of any drug I have ever taken. I think it should be taken off the market. Although the hot flashes were diminished a bit, the terrible withdrawl symptoms are worse than the hot flashes ever were. The so called &quot;brain zaps&quot; are debilitating. I have them almost constantly. My Dr. told me to wean myself off it, but since it comes only in capsule form, and only comes in one strength, that is difficult to do. I went from 1xday to every other day then stopped. I realize the weaning process was too short and this is likely the reason for the severe symptoms. I can&#039;t help but wonder if these will ever go away. Does anyone know how long this is going to last? I feel like I&#039;m losing my mind."
