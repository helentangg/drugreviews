"This drug has been amazing for me! I went from not being able to think clearly and rationally after a very abusive marriage and stressor of special needs children to being a calm supportive single mother. I used to avoid cleaning or spending time with my kids because I was so in stress survival mode that I could not handle the little things. The side effects for me are near to nothing and I think it even helps my metabolism. I was really reluctant to take a drug but I am happy I listened to older experienced people and my therapist. Really has helped so much. I still hate the idea that I need it. Yet, I am so happy that I have it available to me.  I don&#039;t have a foggy brain and I sleep really well. I used to even avoid sleeping."
