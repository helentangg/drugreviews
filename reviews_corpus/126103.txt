"Viibryd worked at first for me, but then I started to see an increase in my mood issues/ depression. While taking Viibryd I feel that it is hard to generate emotion at times, but I also feel easily adgitated, annoyed, and short-tempered frequently. I have also experienced a decrease in my sexual desires and overall energy."
