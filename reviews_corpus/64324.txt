"I&#039;m on Zoloft, and I&#039;ve been taking it for almost a month now. It&#039;s helped so much with my panic &amp; anxiety. I also suffer from severe depression. But I don&#039;t see any change with it helping my deprsssion. My anxiety is so much better now so if that&#039;s what you have wrong too I suggest Zoloft, but for depression no.. I know it works different for everyone but this is just my experience."
