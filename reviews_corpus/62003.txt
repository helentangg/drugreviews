"I am on Day 3 of 20mg Citalopram after a period of extreme anxiety and stress.  This is the worst day so far.  Exhausted. Headache. Diarrhea.  Nauseous. No appetite.  Shaking body.  No concentration.  Just feel awful.  I read from other reviewers that this will pass and to stick with this drug but I am having difficulty believing that it will.  My Doctor did say it would get worse before it got any better."
