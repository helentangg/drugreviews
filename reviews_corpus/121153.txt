"I was diagnosed with IBS 15 years ago with no relief except by a prescription of a mild muscle relaxer which made me tired and didn&#039;t always help. 
Recently I hit a major depression and asked for help and was prescribed venaflaxin and haven&#039;t had a single episode in two weeks. That in itself is a miracle to me. Not sad or sick...finally!!"
