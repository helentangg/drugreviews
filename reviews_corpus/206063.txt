"I have been taking Pristiq for 5 days.  This is the first antidepressant I have ever taken.  It is working great, though the first day or two I felt like I was taking diet pills.  My appetite is gone and I have lost 4 pounds in 5 days.  I have felt a good deal of nausea, but have not vomited. I&#039;m always thirsty and have trouble sleeping (which was a problem before Pristiq), but my doctor gave me Xanax to help me fall asleep. I feel better than I did before.  I hope it will work for you too.
