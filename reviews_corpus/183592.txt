"Works wonderfully to control pain at higher dose, but caused exhaustion during day (took at night) - tried lowering dose - after 3 days could feel pain in shoulders &amp; thighs beginning to creep back so had to increase dose again &amp; then had to take an upper dose (prescribed) during day to keep me going or I couldn&#039;t work - I&#039;m a psychotherapist. The worst part is I&#039;m terribly dizzy - legs have given out several times - sometimes limbs are useless - only upon getting up morning or after sitting or getting out of car - never when sitting or once up walking around. So I love Cymbalta for pain - hate it for side effects."
