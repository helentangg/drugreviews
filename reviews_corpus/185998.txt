"I was on Effexor and Wellbutrin for several years and I have gained 20 lbs.  That made me more depressed about myself.  I told the PA I would like to try a new generation of anti depressants to see if anything changes.  It has been a week and I feel great ! My anxiety has been greatly reduced! It is like how amazing life is without being afraid or worrying about everything. I still take the Wellbutrin and that is all I want to take.  She wants to add Ability, that has so many bad side effects...it something to celebrate to not force a smile....good luck"
