"I switched from Zoloft due to the sexual side effects. I have tried almost every antidepressant medicine out there with little or no success. The first few weeks I was on it I had horrible dreams. I would wake up in the middle of the night and couldn&#039;t go back to sleep. Crying all the time. I have been on it now for about 5 or 6 weeks and am agitated very easily, dizzy, can&#039;t concentrate and my mind is constantly racing. I was trying to give it a full 8 weeks but I can not stand to be around myself. I feel sorry for everyone else. Viibryd is not the medicine for me. I had very high hopes of this medicine."
