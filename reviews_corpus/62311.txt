"This medicine is wonderful.  I never believed in taking anti depressants because I didn&#039;t want to become dependent on them.  I&#039;ve taken Zoloft ... I had real bad constipation and it worsened my depression.  Celexa has done it for me.  I had postpartum depression and went through a terrible break up with my fiance and have been able to cope very well with everything that has gone on in my life. I would recommend this medicine to anyone."
