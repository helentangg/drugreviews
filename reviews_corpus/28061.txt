"I am 49 1/2 and today I can tell you I am happy, positive and full of hope. I am on 10mg of Lexapro just finishing up my 8th week. I also have Ativan for emergencies and I still need Ambein to sleep. Before taking Lexapro I was always anxious and easily overwhelmed. Then I had too many thing happen in a short time period that caused me to have a melt down. Three trips to the ER with one of them a short stay in a Unit after Celexa caused me to have suicidal thoughts. I was constantly worrying about everything. I couldn&#039;t eat, sleep but with Lexapro my appetite came back in just the first 3 days. I was very scared to try another drug after Celexa, but I can&#039;t tell you how happy I am to be back better then new. Take a chance."
