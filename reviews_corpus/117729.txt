"I was diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome two years ago in August 2008. It&#039;s been a long, lousy 2 years.  I&#039;ve been on many different medicines and none of them worked.  Finally nortriptyline (25mg) once a day before bed has FINALLY given me relief.  It&#039;s only been one week since I started this drug but it&#039;s been a week where I can actually leave the house and not worry about my IBS (diarrhea) issues.  I&#039;m a 37 year old male.  Lomotil and Imodium have only worked partially for me.  Nortriptyline worked right away (the next day I was issue free - and I&#039;m not exaggerating)  I wish my doctor had me try this medicine earlier, although I do understand him wanting me to try other medicines first.  HOWEVER, I still take a half Imodium every other day with this medicine."
