"I have suffered from Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder for most of my life but wasn&#039;t aware that&#039;s what I was going through. Just last month got diagnosed FINALLY and I am a totally new person on the Sarafem. Not different in terms of my personality. Just who I am without all the rage and mood swings. My relationships with my husband and kids is drastically improved. I did have some sleeplessness in the first week but other than that, no side effects. It has changed my life. I look forward to actually living now. I don&#039;t like resorting to medicine right away. But I really wish I would have considered this sooner."
