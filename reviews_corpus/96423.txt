"I have been taking Sertraline 50 mg for almost 2 weeks now.  The first day I had a little diarrhea and loss of appetite.  When I did eat I felt a little indigestion for the first few days.  Still not very hungry and lost about 4 lbs in 2 weeks.  Diarrhea only lasted one day.  First week I had insomnia and restless leg syndrome (still have).  I COULD not fall asleep, although felt tired and yawning.  I had to take Nyquil just to fall asleep.  I haven&#039;t had any panic attacks since I started taking this medicine (which is great). It also helped with PMS and my period snuck up on me.  I usually know exactly when it is due, because of horrible PMS.  I don&#039;t exactly feel happy but I&#039;m not crying, like I was, for no reason.   I&#039;m gonna stick with it."
