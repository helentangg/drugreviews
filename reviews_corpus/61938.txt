"I found myself struggling with the day to day after my partner&#039;s gambling addiction reared its head once more &amp; couldn&#039;t keep it together to move us forward again.
Put simply, the Citalopram let me keep it together. I could see solutions to problems, I could recognise blips for what they were &amp; not the end of the world, I stopped constantly churning the negatives around in my head.
 I still had depth of emotion - when sad things happened, I was sad - but was able to be rational about the choices I could make.
I was on 20mg a day for just over a year, weaned off to 10mg a day then every other day &amp; am now off it. My life problems are still there but Citalopram gave me the kick start I needed to stop crying &amp; live."
