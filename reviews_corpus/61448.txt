"This med has been extremely effective at keeping my anxiety down for close to 20 yrs.  5-10mg has been my ideal dosage, currently at 5mg.  I&#039;m commenting here so as to share my thoughts on side effects.  For me, going on or off of this med, or changing dosage, results in feeling horrible for a period of time measured in days.  If you feel similarly, make sure you tell your doc and perhaps lean on a med (e.g. a benzo) if need be while you&#039;re transitioning.  But always try to remember (I know it&#039;s difficult!) that the bad feeling is temporary, and that you will feel better.   Give it time to work for you."
