"This medication is the best antidepressant I have taken and believe me I&#039;ve tried them all! Works fast, in 5 days I felt normal. I had to go off it due to loss of medical benefits and I had no bad side effects. I started taking it again and felt normal again in 5 days. I&#039;ve been on it now 3 yrs straight and it keeps working just as well as it did when I started."
