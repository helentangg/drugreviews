"I recently starting taking Cymbalta for my chronic back (several herniated discs), Costocondritis (chest inflamation), and other related pains classified as Fibromyalgia and Chronic lower back pain.   The medication works.  It has nearly removed my chest pain and lower back pains by 90% and only a few lingering pains still exist and only in spurts. I&#039;ve only been on the 60mg dosage for a few weeks, so it may get better. As a side effect, my PE is gone. I never told a doc about it and it has been killing me for a decade. I&#039;ve tried everything else, none helped. I looked online with a search of Cymbalta and PE and there are sources to confirm it works. "
