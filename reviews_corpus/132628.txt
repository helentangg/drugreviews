"I&#039;ve tried various medicine options. I take 10-20mg of generic doxepin per night now. I still wake up during the night but I fall back asleep much easier than before. I get 5-6 hours of good solid sleep per night which is great for me. The only time I have problems with drowsiness the next day is after I take 20mg at night. "
