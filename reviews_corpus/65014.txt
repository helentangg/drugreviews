"Just updating my progress with sertraline. It has saved my life. Before this little miraculous pill I was in a downward spiral. I&#039;m a 37.male and always happy till I snapped one day with a panic attack. I upped my dose slowly as every increase will increase anxiety for a few days. Other wise I have had no problems with sex or erections.I can still enjoy a few wines. If you are suffering with panic or anxiety please try this medication and give it at least 3 months to work as no one should have to deal with feeling that way."
