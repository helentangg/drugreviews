"its a no brainer, 
without I am as useful as an ashtray on a motorbike,

with 75 mg per day I am confident for any situation, it changed my life in 1 day.
To not be able to take part in every day life, to not smile laugh love be hurt be funny be normal.
Any risk of emotion, tipped me of the edge and I do mean any, 
You know when life is bad, when your scared to cross a road fearful of not getting to the other side without collapsing in a quivering heap 
Before diagnosed life was an every day hell
thank god for it, easy to take, and many years later the same now just like the first time.
Work a treat 

good luck
