"I take Cymbalta for Generalised Anxiety Disorder and depression, something I&#039;ve had on and off for 6 years (I am now 24). A lot of people are quick to write this drug off, and I admit the initial side effects can be tough like nausea and feeling so tired, but after taking 30mg for three weeks and increasing to 60, with the increase I noticed a quick change, my anxiety decreased rapidly, and instead of tiredness I began to experience an almost high feeling which sometimes makes me hyperactive, but surely that&#039;s better than anxiety and depression. I would recommend taking it, but give it a few weeks and take the proper 60ng dose before you judge it; it&#039;s really helped me, it&#039;s got me out of s really bad place."
