"On Lexapro 14 months now. I almost never want Xanax anymore, and I am sleeping better than I have since I was a teenager (I am 46). Two negative results: sex drive has decreased markedly, and I&#039;ve had a 10% weight gain. But even with these two factors, I would never consider going back to the person I was before Lexapro."
