"This medicine is the best for migraines.I have been on this medicine for almost a year and I started getting relief after two weeks of taking it. The side effects that I have experienced is, weight gain, dry mouth and dizziness and especially if you wait to take the medicine after a certain time of the night. I give this medicine two thumbs up. I currently take two 50mg at bedtime."
