"I am a veteran.  I was diagnosed with depression while on active duty (started on Wellbutrin), though I am certain the depression went back years before.  I always knew something wasn&#039;t right, but could never quite figure out what it was.  I had no desire to live and could not seem to shake that.  I admitted myself to a mental health unit recently with suicidal tendencies.  I started taking Celexa while in the unit, and I feel like a person now.  I am not in a &quot;good&quot; place in the world right now, but in my own &quot;world&quot; I am feeling great."
