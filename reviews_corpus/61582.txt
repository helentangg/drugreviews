"I have been talking celexa for over a month and have noticed a big difference in anxiety and moods. I have also lost weight while taking it. I never feel hungry and when I do eat, I don&#039;t eat near as much. (I&#039;ve heard this effects everyone differently) it did make me yawn continuously when first starting it, and I took it at bedtime due to afraid it would make me sleepy. That side effect did go away. I still have great energy during the day, doesn&#039;t make me want to sleep or feel draggy. Doesn&#039;t effect my sleep of a night. Only bad thing I have to say is I noticed a huge difference quickly with sex drive. Other than that, great drug and as I said before, every drug effects people differently so that may not be an issue with someone else. :)"
