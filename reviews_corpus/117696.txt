"So I read some of these experiences and was doubtful it could help my lower back pain, tried pain killers and months of physical therapy to no avail, my primary finally sent me to a neurologist (already had x-rays, and went through that tube, in agony I may add because I could not lay flat) they quickly put me on the Nortriptyline at 10mg dose, one week I did not feel any relief, they upped my dose to 25mg and same thing not much relief at all,  went to 50mg and felt better really dulled the shooting pains down my left leg and foot, went to 100mg with better results. Now I&#039;m at 125mg and life is much better, I can walk in a mall, drive my car and get back to a normal life again.  This is supposed to break my pain cycle and so far so good."
