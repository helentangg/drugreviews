"I  started on 60 MG of noritripteline at the age of 65 as a replacement for Cymbalta, which I could no longer afford.  I found that when it was combined with 100 MG of sertaline (zoloft).  This combination gave me the greatest relief from the chronic depression I have suffered from since the age of 15.

But I was not aware of its anticholinergic effects on older people which manifested at age 67 when I began to experience problems walking,  repeated falls, lethargy, mental confusion and memory problems.  In addition to the noritripteline,  I was also taking benadryl (over the counter) to aid with sleep at night,  another anticholinergic drug. Both medications can be detrimental in older population groups and result in my symptoms."
