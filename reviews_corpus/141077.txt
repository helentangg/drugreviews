"I&#039;ve had serious anxiety since I was a teen. In the last 4 years (thanks to some random health issues) it has skyrocketed and life has become unbearable. Everyday I thought I was having a heart attack - despite stellar cardio results. Anxiety took full control of my life - mentally and physically. Xanax and booze (not together) work like a charm but I fear the addiction potential. My doc put me on low dose of Lexapro (5 mg) and within 48 hours all my crazy anxiety ended. Gone. I feel normal again - it&#039;s been YEARS since I&#039;ve felt this way. Small sexual side effect (long time to ejaculate) and slight weight gain but I&#039;m ok with that. Another side effect: my co-workers &amp; friends like me again."
