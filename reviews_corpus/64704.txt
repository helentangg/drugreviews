"Ok so I was really bad depressed so I decided one day to the  GP. He gave me citalopram oh no so wrong for me!!! Then been given sertraline it worked wonders. Took them for 2 yrs till I was told off to stop! Big mistake as soon as I stopped 4 months after I begged my GP yesterday to put me back on them so starting them today"
