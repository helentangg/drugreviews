"I&#039;ve been on 150mg for 1 year now for anxiety. I have previously taken Paxil as well for years but it seemed to have stopped working for me. Although Effexor has helped with anxiety (not a &quot;cure&quot;), if I miss 1 dose I experience the worst side effects: dizziness, nausea, vertigo, diarrhea, headache. It has also significantly decreased my libido. I will be trying to come off of this and probably switch to something else because of this."
