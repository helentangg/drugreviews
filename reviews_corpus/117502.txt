"I have a &quot;band&quot; of the &quot;fuzzies&quot; crossing top of head, down on each side of my head. &quot;Tinglies&quot; on left of my forehead. Given Nortrip. 25mg, take 2x per day. Really NO change. Have lived with these problems for almost 30 years. Maybe by making me drowsy, then I won&#039;t notice nerve pain so much? Whatever."
