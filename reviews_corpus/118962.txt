"Female, 23, anxiety disorder. I have been on this medication for almost a year. I have dealt with anxiety my whole life and finally when I was having trouble going to school and work I turned to Zoloft. It has improved my quality of life. I have had the dose increased from 25 to 50 to 75. Side effects I have felt include: loss of appetite, dizziness, and mood swings. All side effects happened with start and increase of medicine and subside after getting used to it. I still have breakdowns sometimes but not as often. "
