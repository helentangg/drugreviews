"Lexapro really helped me to feel more like myself. After a long time battling a &quot;mystery&quot; disease, I was debilitated, I couldn&#039;t function in my normal life, and was feeling just very strange. I decided that I would go to a psyche, and he prescribed me Lexapro. It really seemed to help. I eventually stopped taking it, and have been pretty much okay for the past 4 years or so, but now the symptoms are flaring up again, with some additional stuff so I am going through the medical rounds again to make sure there is nothing underlying. And if there&#039;s not then I&#039;m going to suggest that I get back on Lexapro because it really did seem to help me! I didn&#039;t have any side effects with it that I can remember. It really worked well."
