"I was really surprised to see a post from Joanzie (taken for 10 years or more) November 15, 2016 today when she indicated her pharmacy could no longer get it.  I have taken Desipramine (Generic 
 is Norpramin) for nearly 10 years now and have no problems getting it Amneal makes 10 mg pills, but I am now switching to 50 mg. LGM Pharma makes it, but I&#039;m sure there are others.  I have used it since 911, as it really did a number on me.  If I forget to take it, I know it, as I end up in lala land, as my head just feels like it is detached from my body.  As long as I take the drug when prescribed, I&#039;m steady Eddie!"
