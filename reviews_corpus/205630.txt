"PRISTIQ HAS SAVED MY LIFE. Fourteen days ago I went to a psychiatrist because I was having suicidal thoughts and anxiety disorders that were paralyzing me with fear at 3:00 AM, I would sit up in bed and could not get to the other end of the black tunnel. I didn&#039;t enjoy anything I used to (I love fashion, I love my pets, I love New York City) and I was walking around wanting to die. Two weeks later, I am ME again.  I am laughing, I am happy. I&#039;m enjoying people, my work and am in the process of getting sober which has been much better with the help of Pristiq.  I was feeling so uncomfortable in my skin I could barely sit still at work. Now I am meditating and can be still in my body.  I am calm and peaceful and content."
