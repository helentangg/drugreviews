"While Pristiq does work great. I wish my doctor would have warned me about how hard it would be to get off of this medicine. I am in my mid 20&#039;s and my doctor was aware that I wanted to get pregnant in the future. I have had issues with seasonal depression and taken different anti-depressants for a 5-6 months in the past. Pristiq has been a nightmare to get off of. I have reduced the dosage as my doctor has said so that I can get pregnant in the future. But I have had horrible vomiting episodes, confusion, brain zaps, terrible muscle pain, sharp shooting pain throughout my body. Feeling disconnected. I still have not been able to get off this medicine. I wish you all the best."
