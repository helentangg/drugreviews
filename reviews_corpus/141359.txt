"I&#039;ve had severe anxiety since I can remember. I&#039;ve been through a lot in life and it started as a small child. Now that I&#039;ve finally turned 27 and after years of having daily panic attacks, constant shaking, constantly thinking weeks ahead of time over an event, and heart pounding, and having everything set off my Anxiety I went to see a psychiatrist. He prescribed me 10mg of Lexapro and 5mg of Valium if needed. I&#039;ve finally started to wake up feeling better and being a lot more calm. I&#039;ve only been on it for 2 weeks today but I&#039;m feeling so much better! It&#039;s weird to feel a little normal and it&#039;s taking a lot to get used to this feeling. I can&#039;t wait to see what happens week 4 to 6 since my anxiety is not fully gone yet."
