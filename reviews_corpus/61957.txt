"I started taking Celexa 14 years ago after the death of my father.  I had always had panic attacks, anxiety everyday, but never sought help.  After my father passed away, I could not cope with the anxiety, so off to the Dr. I went.  I did my research beforehand and asked the Dr. for Celexa.  I started out at 10mg and then went to 20mg and have been there ever since.  My life completely changed, I didn&#039;t realize what a hold the anxiety had on me.  I will never be without my Celexa and the Dr. said I could stay on it forever, it won&#039;t hurt me.  I wished I would have listened to my Dr. 30 years ago when he suggested an SSRI for the anxiety, it would have spared me so many years of being inside the walls of anxiety."
