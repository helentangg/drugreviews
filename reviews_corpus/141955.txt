"I LOVE LEXAPRO. I had really bad anxiety before Lexapro and now I feel much calmer and more in control of my life.  I only take 5mgs because my body is super sensitive but I can definitely feel and see a change.  Sometimes I still suffer from anxiety during PMS but during the rest of the month I&#039;m so happy and life is so much easier to deal with.  Lexapro was a life saver for me."
