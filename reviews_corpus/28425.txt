"I have suffered from depression for years.  At first I was a little apprehensive to take any medication but I had reached a low point.  Everyday I woke up with a storm cloud over my head, I was irritable, quick to anger and always grumpy.  I could literally feel the weight of my mood on me at all times.  I barely laughed anymore, I didn&#039;t find anything enjoyable.  I have been taking 10mg of Lexapro for three weeks now and I am floored by the difference it has made.  It&#039;s like I can feel again.  I know this sounds cliche, but everything is more vivid, more colorful, more lively.  I didn&#039;t experience any side effects other than loss of appetite."
