"I&#039;ve been on Cymbalta for about 4 months and it has greatly helped my ADD.  I&#039;m able to concentrate much better and my mood has improved dramatically. It quietened the negative thoughts in my head and my depression is much better too. Unfortunately, it hasn&#039;t helped my Fibromyalgia pain all that much. Just started on Lyrica today... we&#039;ll see how that goes."
