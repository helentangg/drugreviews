"I have intermittent problems with mild depression and moderate anxiety usually due to financial stress. I have been taking 50 mg for a week and I have noticed that my anxiety has been substantially reduced. And I notice no negative side effects with Pristiq. I only notice that I am more energetic and awake all day long. I have no sleepiness during the day or trouble sleeping (problems I&#039;ve had on other drugs). Really good medicine so far. I don&#039;t give it a 10 only because I have only been taking it for a week. I&#039;m curious to see if the effects last longer term."
