"I am  40 year old woman and I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia and Myofascial pain syndrome around 2 years ago and had symptoms for about 3 years before that. This medication was my doctor&#039;s first choice. I am a member of one of leading health care providers in CA, and she said that they have had much success prescribing this medication to patients with nerve pain disorders. This medicine made a considerable difference in my quality of life, improving my sleep, pain, stiffness, and tenderness. I take 30mg every evening before bed and make sure that I get about 8-9 hours sleep. I can always tell the next day if I&#039;ve forgotten my dose. I plan on taking it for as long as it helps."
