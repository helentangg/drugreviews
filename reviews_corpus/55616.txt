"I&#039;ve struggled with GAD since my late teens which worsened following a tragic and untimely death in the family..which also lead to PTSD I tried numerous anti depressants but most of them slowed me down I didn&#039;t want this. So many years ago maybe 12 years ago I was prescribed effexor since then my dose has gone up and down I&#039;m now on 225mg daily I was able to come off them cold turkey for 3 pregnancies I can only suggest early pregnancy hormones took over as withdrawal effects were minimal. But in general withdrawal effects are horrendous if I miss a day or 2 as I&#039;ve failed to collect them on time I have an upset stomach...sweating and termors...nightmares, feelings of terror, luckily they work fast! I&#039;m a fan they help &amp; make me feel normal"
