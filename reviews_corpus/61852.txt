"Been on citalopram for 6 months now.  I tried to beat anxiety for years, constantly battling my thoughts, counselling, CBT, exercise etc... In the end I gave up and went on medication.  The first week was HELL!  Jaw clenching, extreme thirst, lethargic, excessive yawning, exhausted... I nearly came off them! Even after 4 weeks I wasn&#039;t sure if they were doing anything.  My advice is stick it out!  After about 2 months I noticed the full effects.  I wasn&#039;t crying anymore, wasn&#039;t as angry or impatient, didn&#039;t worry over everything anymore! I fall asleep within 10 minutes when I used to be awake most of the night and unable to sleep! Situations that I&#039;d usually get very stressed out over are now much easier, and I&#039;m now much more laid back :)"
