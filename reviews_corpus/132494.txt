"Great product.
I never had a problem falling asleep before, I can and always could fall asleep in 2 or 3 minutes.
My problem was during the night when I would wake up at 2am and be up for the day.
With Silenor I still wake up on occasion but I go right back to sleep.
I have been taking it for months now, still works great.
Not groggy the next day.
If your problem is getting to sleep this might not be right for you.
If your problem is staying asleep or falling back to sleep after waking up during the night then Silenor will be a big help."
