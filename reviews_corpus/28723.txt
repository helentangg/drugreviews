"I was an abusive controlling husband for 10 years. I went into a depression 6 months ago and hit rock bottom 4 weeks ago at which time I was dragged to a doctor and prescribed Lexapro. The first week was rough but after that all was okay. The fog slowly lifted and now just 1 month later. I am a completely different person. I no longer get angry and abusive, I mean I went from being the worst husband to the most considerate man you could ever meet (words of my wife). I have suffered from low self esteem all my life and always worry and over think. Now I never dwell. So far this medicine is a miracle for me. I will wait and see but for now it has saved me a lot of grief."
