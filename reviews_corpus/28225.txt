"I suffered from every type of anxiety in the book. I could barely go to the grocery store. I got started on 5 mg a few weeks ago. The first week I took this I felt amazing -- more energy, more motivation, happier etc. The second week I felt horrific. So depressed and borderline suicidal (which I never dealt with before). I got scared that the meds would not work. DON&#039;T GIVE UP. Now on the third week I feel much better. I feel like I used to mostly and normalized. Not super peppy like the first week, maybe a little more tired and slightly foggy, but nothing compared to how I felt with anxiety. Most importantly, I have ZERO obsessive thoughts. Mind you I am still eating well, no caffeine, no alcohol and exercising daily."
