"Lexapro saved my life. I was locked into worry, self-recrimination, and rumination.  I couldn&#039;t let go of the past and see myself in a good light.  Within a couple of days the anxiety lifted and I could finally SLEEP! I&#039;ve been taking it now for 6 weeks.  In that time, I got a volunteer job that I love and I&#039;m so upbeat. I&#039;m grateful for this site because I read others&#039; experiences which led me to ask my psychiatrist for Lexapro.  Thanks to the posts about taking only the brand name Lexapro (my psychiatrist concurs).  It&#039;s difficult taking medicines because with emotional/mental problems we feel out of control and taking a medicine that doesn&#039;t work makes us feel more out of control. It&#039;s worth trying until you find what works.  Don&#039;t give up."
