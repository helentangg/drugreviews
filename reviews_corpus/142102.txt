"I&#039;ve been battling depression and anxiety for 20 years. I&#039;ve tried just about every medicine, but they all kept me from sleeping and I suffer insomnia on my own as it is, but they made it worse. It took a month on lexapro before I could wake up. But I gave it that month to see and the side effect went away and I sleep better than I usually do. It helped depression and anxiety in just days.
Recently, my husband of only one year left me at the same time that my mother died. It&#039;s not helping as much now, but were I not on it I would NOT be here. Even on it, it&#039;s a daily fight."
