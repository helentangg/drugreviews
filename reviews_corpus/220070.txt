"On Dec 2015 I had excruciating cutting burning vaginal pain. Along with frequent urgency to go urinate , all the test under the sun was done but all came back negative and after 2 months of tests my urogynocologist said its volvodaneia. He prescribed Amitriptyline .
I was very skeptical about this. .then finally I started with 5 mg for my body to get used it.Then 1 week after I did 10 mg...and after 10 days I went to 15 mg...that did the trick no more paib but then I amped it to 20 mg.
I never thought I will be able to have normal life again but this med saved my life.In this 6 weeks of taking Amitriptyline I had few days of pain of level 2 .but rest days so far ok.no pain !!
I have been told to take this med for3months."
