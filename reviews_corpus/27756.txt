"I&#039;ve only been on it for a couple months but it seems to have kicked in. I distinctly remember the moment I felt it; it was a sort of euphoria that felt like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders. After that, it definitely died down. It has helped with anxiety and agitation, but I don&#039;t feel like it has been doing anything in the way of depression. It&#039;s also flattened me out quite a bit in lieu of helping me feel more balanced. I&#039;m going to wait a little longer and then probably try something else."
