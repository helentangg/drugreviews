"My cardiologist put me on Lexapro a year ago due to anxiety and heart palpitations.  I was very happy not to feel anxiety anymore and thought this is a miracle drug. Personally I thought I will stay all my life on Lexapro, this is how good it made me feel.  I slept well, I was very calm and was able to better deal with my chronic pain due to spinal cord damages. I blamed prednisone for my rheumatoid arthritis but when I found this board and read all of your opinions about Lexapro I realized what made me this way. I&#039;m just not sure how I&#039;ll go off Lexapro."
