"I started having panic attacks and anxiety coupled with mild depression.  I have been on Zoloft for 10 years and have always taken 50mg.  It has literally saved my life. I had gotten to the point I could not leave my house and had run out of stores and restaurants on several occassions.  I use to snap at my kids but the medication leveled out my moods and cured my panic attacks and had worked very well for me. I recommend it highly."
