"I have severe depression and have been on Trintellix for a month.  At first, the nausea and vomiting were awful.  My doctor gave me promethizine, but that didn&#039;t help.   A medication that did work is Zofran, and it works like a charm for the nausea.  It completely stops it.  I take Trintellix in afternoon and about an hour later,  Zofran.  No more nausea;  I am so relieved.  However, I thought Trintellix would help my depression more.  I seem to be more anxious.  I am prescribed Valium 5 mg. up to once a day, but I rarely used to take it.  Now I am so anxious that I have to take it.  I was so hopeful, and now I&#039;m so disappointed that Trintellix is not working as expected. Does anyone have any suggestions for another anti-depressant?"
