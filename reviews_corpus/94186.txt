"I was given samples of this w/o  any verbal warnings. I took it as directed: 10 mg/day. I started downhill rapidly w/o making a connection to it.( Also take lexapro 150mg/day).I didn&#039;t realize I was getting worse. About 2 weeks on 10 mg/day, I was suicidal. I just felt that like fading away &amp; no one would notice. I reached out by text. Shortly there after one of my friends showed up w/ police &amp; ambulance. Hospital transferred me to Mental health institution. 3 days later it was out of my system &amp; I recognized the culprit. Day 4 I was allowed to leave. Terrifying then enlightening. Please ask your Dr. or pharmacist about drug interactions. This one is new to the market. Hope my experience helps someone."
