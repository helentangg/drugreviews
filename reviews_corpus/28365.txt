"Lexapro is amazing. I was blind sided by a panic attack when I was 22. This panic lead to being anxious which lead to obsessive thoughts about feeling poorly, ultimately causing male depression (not sad but lack of lust for life).

It was a viscous cycle, I&#039;d obsess over being anxious and this caused me to be more anxious. I had so a dozen symptoms ranging from dizziness to blurry vision to stomach discomfort. It just made no sense to me how all this was related.

Long story short, started Lexapro, first 2 weeks made everything worse that just as quickly as it can&#039;t the anxiety and obsessive thoughts were gone. Wow up one day and my mind went racing!

Would recommend and encourage people not to get discouraged if it doesn&#039;t work immediately."
