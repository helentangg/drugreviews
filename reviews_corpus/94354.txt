"Brintellix has reduced my depression to the lowest levels I&#039;ve ever had with one medication. I have had medication resistant major depression with suicidal thoughts and occasional auditory hallucinations, severe insomnia, and attention problems for 30 years. I have had to take 3 meds to control it in the past. This med is making me feel incredibly &quot;normal&quot;.  However,  I am having headaches and some nausea at 25 mg (always need high doses) but the headaches are improving- I think they will pass like most side effects do if I  stick with it and practice patience. I feel to good to give up easily."
