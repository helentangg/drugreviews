"Nothing has worked for me for anxiety, depression, or insomnia. Add this to the list. I wish I could find something that works. My doc put me on 50mg of this in the morning and before bed, along with 1 &amp; 1/2 1.5mg klonipin 3x a day and 2mg Xanax as needed. I was also given lexapro for depression. It didn&#039;t help at all. Caused sleeplessness, restlessness, worsened insomnia, weight gain and bloating, ED, and gynocemastia. Not sure which meds caused which, but I was also on nexium, water pills, and lisinipril. Got off all meds as fast as I could and am still suffering from stage 2 hypertension, depression, anxiety, SAD, insomnia, and GERD without meds. Life is rough, but at least I&#039;m not dealing with side effects."
