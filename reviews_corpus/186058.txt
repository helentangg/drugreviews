"I took pristiq for a month, one pill a day,
I&#039;m currently tapering myself off of it now because it has caused the following effects:
Loss of any emotion
Uncontrolable shaking
Inability to feel hungry or full 
&amp;
Inability to feel pain 
I&#039;m 16 and this anti depressant is for 18  but my gp thought it was a good idea to prescribe it for me? I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll ever take another anti depressant again I&#039;d rather feel everything than nothing."
