"Doxepin at 150 mg. saved my life! I&#039;ve had chronic insomnia for as long as I can remember with sometimes several nights resulting in no sleep at all. I was diagnosed with a number of major medical problems from early adulthood, the worst of which being Type 1 Diabetes at age 24, so managing my overall healthcare now at age 55 is complicated by the severe sleep deprivation. I inherited all of the medical problems from both sides of the family tree and from my father, inherited a unique tolerance to any sedating medications, so no sleep aid I was ever prescribed was effective. About 8 mos. ago a new psychiatrist asked about sleep problems resulting in a script for 150 mg. Doxepin. Every night since-a full, deep night&#039;s restorative sleep!!"
