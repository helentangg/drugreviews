"I was suicidal for many years,  I tried NOT to commit suicide but ended up trying 5 times,  I started in 180 miligrams of Elavil but craved sweets and gained weight and was always tired.  I started on Paxil and have taken it for 20 or so years.  I started at 50mg and now take 40mg,  I feel completely normal.  I haven&#039;t gained weight.  My diagnosis was Major Endoginal Depression."
