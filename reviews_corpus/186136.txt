"I have been on Pristiq 5 days, the 1st day I felt great, the 2nd, 3rd, 4th &amp; 5th, my last day as of yesterday has been pure hell. Nausea, constant headache, flu like symptoms, not being able to read the paper or anything, vision really messed up, hot &amp; then cold, total confusion, can&#039;t remember something that happened an hour ago, my skin itches so bad it&#039;s red. I&#039;m not going to take it ever again, I would rather be depressed, I will take my doctor back the samples he gave me tomorrow &amp; let him know my problems with Pristiq. I know an antidepressant can take time to be effective but I don&#039;t want to risk anymore withdrawal symptoms than what I&#039;m having after taking this just 5 days. I will never take it again."
