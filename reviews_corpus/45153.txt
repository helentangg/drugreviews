"I&#039;ve tried a few antidepressents. Zoloft, Wellbutrin, Remeron...

I&#039;ve been on Prozac for nearly three months. I was prescribed 20 mg a day for the first month and told the doctor I didn&#039;t notice anything. She still kept me on 20 mg a day for the second month. Still nothing, but drowsiness was a problem (gone now).

I&#039;ve been on 30 mg a day for the past three weeks, and in the past week or so, I think something about me is different. I rarely have the suicidal thoughts I did before (I still do though). I&#039;m also normally really awkward, but now I feel natural when I say something, no shaky voice. Idk how to explain what I&#039;m feeling.

The past week I&#039;ve been pretty nauseous though. I usually eat a LOT though so I don&#039;t mind it"
