"So far started treatment a week ago. Already experiencing horrible side effects: ongoing ringing ears; constantly nauseous; slughish tired during the day; Light headed throughout the day; rapid heart beat; had 2 nightmares which I woke up catching my own breath because I thought I was dying. That same night I had that dream twice; still cannot sleep more than 4 1/2 pushing 5. Hrs of sleep. with 10mg. Still having migraines. Called my Dr. Office 2 days ago and have not received a call back yet. I am supposed to go up to 30 or 40mg. But with these side effects I just want to get off of 10mg."
