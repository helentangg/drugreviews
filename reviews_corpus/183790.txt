"I have been on Cymbalta for 4 months now for anxiety and depression. I have suffered from depression and anxiety for about 16 years, since I was a preteen. I have tried several medications with bad results and harsh side effects. I have had pretty good success with Cymbalta so far. I started off on 30mg and just increased to 60 mg last week. I feel happier, have more energy, more positive. The only side effects I have had is insomnia, jaw clenching and hot flashes, which are not constant, and mostly tolerable compared to the side effects I had before when on other medicines. This medication has worked well for me so far, and I hope it continues to."
