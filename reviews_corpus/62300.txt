"I started taking Celexa a week ago for social anxiety disorder, and I already feel major relief.  For the first time, I was social at work and made new friends.  I feel happier and can focus on caring about other things and people rather than just myself.  I had social anxiety, but I can honestly say that this medicine has worked miracles on me so far, and I&#039;m only on 10mg. This medicine has quite literally saved my life.  If you are experiencing depression or anxiety, in my opinion, it&#039;s not worth it to keep fighting it without medication.  I suffered from social anxiety disorder for 2 years before finally deciding to take it.  Now, I wish I had taken it much sooner!"
