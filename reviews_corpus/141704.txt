"I&#039;m a pharmacy student and have taken Lexapro. This is supposed to be one of the most effective drugs on the market for anxiety and depression. I suppose I&#039;m the exception, because taking Lexapro was terrible. I switched from Celexa (worked decently), which is chemically very similar to Lexapro. My doctor and I decided to try it thinking I would get even better results. That didn&#039;t happen. Lexapro turned me into a paranoid hermit. My anxiety hit the roof, I would have random depression episodes and begin crying for no apparent reason. Constant worrying. I will NEVER take this pill again. I&#039;m on Prozac now which has worked wonderfully. But like I said- Lexapro works very well and has helped many people. Just not me."
