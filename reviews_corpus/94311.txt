"I get anxiety and depression. I&#039;ve tried several antidepressants and for anxiety too none worked for me. They would cause drowsiness and didn&#039;t even work for my anxiety. I would be around my co-workers even felt like I was twitching and they couldn&#039;t walk by me because I felt like ants all over my body. I started taking Brintellix 10 mg and I&#039;m only 114 pounds. It works great for me, more alert at work and wake up at 6 am and feeling refreshed. "
