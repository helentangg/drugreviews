"I took Prozac for 15 years and it was definitely a wonderful drug for my disorder. I was Agoraphobic for 22 years before my doctor discovered Prozac helped with Panic attacks. I started it and in a week I was walking out of my house and greeting my neighbors! I started working and doing things I never dreamed I could do. Then in 2005 my insurance changed to another Pharmaceutical plan and you could take generics or pay full price for the brand name. Unfortunately the generic did not do the same thing as the brand. Prozac price has risen to $403.65 for 3 months and unfortunately I cannot afford this."
