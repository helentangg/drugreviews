"I have been on most of the SSRI over the past 16 years and before that on the old style anti-depressants which were the worst.  I changed to Brintellix after 7 years on Lexapro and at first I felt fantastic. I did have some initial nausea and headache which dissipated over the first few weeks. I started on 10mg and have been on this dose for the last 5 weeks. The initial success has been overshadowed by sleep disturbance with vivid dreams and some nightmares, plus increasing agitation and low level feeling of anger. My concentration is affected by these background feelings as I feel agitated most of the time now.  Think this means it isn&#039;t going to work for me, and yes another failed med!"
