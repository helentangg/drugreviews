"I have been really surprised by Paxil. I&#039;ve been disabled by Panic Disorder (and follow-on depression) for years.  Benzodiazepines provided relief from panic attacks, but increased depression.  I tried other SSRI&#039;s with horrible experiences.

My MD really wanted me on an antidepressant- I wanted away from benzodiazepines, so I took a chance with Paxil. The first month was bit of nausea/cramps - worst were feelings and thoughts were really jumbled. 

Somewhere in 2nd month it all sort of stabilized, I felt a lot better, panic attacks dropped a lot. Now in 5th month - Before Paxil I was housebound and hopeless, slowly starting to live again."
