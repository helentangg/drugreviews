"I have Obessive compulsive disorder which causes a lot of anxiety and depression. Prozac has improved my quality of life I&#039;m now a calm happy person with a great family of my own after being on Prozac a year. It really helps me focus on the real problems in my life and reaching a resolution instead of just feeling overwhelmed. It also greatly increases my energy and focus! It does not make me a zombie to emotion but it does prevent me from obsessing and lingering on how things make me feel. I still feel sad anger etc but in normal amounts like everyone else. Aside from very detailed dreams I&#039;ve had no negative side effects. "
