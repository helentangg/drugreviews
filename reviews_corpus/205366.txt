"After a horrible two years on Prozac Pristiq came in like a saviour. It reminded me what my normal thought process was without depression. I started on 50mg and 3 months in upped it to 100 and most of the time it&#039;s great however like everything tis not perfect. I have good days and bad days. I often have a few weeks of good days and when it&#039;s bad it&#039;s really bad; no motivation, suicidal, depressed, anxious. I also notice that if I miss a day or two I go through major withdrawal and that leads to similar symptoms as a bad day. Overall it really did change my life but it&#039;s not perfect."
