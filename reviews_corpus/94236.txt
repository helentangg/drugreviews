"I been on brintellix for a month now it has helped me a whole lot with panic attacks .. No side effects at all .. I&#039;m taking 10mg a day . Started with 5mg for two weeks then went up to 10mg .. I feel optimistic about the future now I have my life back . I went six months without driving because I was scared of a panic attacks but with this medication I am back driving I suffer from phobia of driving over bridges .."
