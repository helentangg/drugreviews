"I&#039;m 16 and have been on fluoxetine at 40mg for about 8 months now. It works amazingly for me. I don&#039;t break down every night and I don&#039;t sleep for 15  hours anymore. I still have this weird feeling in me that kind of misses the way I was before the medicines, but I don&#039;t think that has to do with my medication. I do have one side effect though, I have had tremors in my hands for about 5 months."
