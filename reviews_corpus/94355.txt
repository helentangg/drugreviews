"I just took my first dose of the 10mg Brintellix after a week of the 5mg. I take mine at night with my Latuda which requires 350 calories so I&#039;ve  experienced virtually no nausea. I&#039;m very surprised that I have taken so well to this drug. Generally, I experience a lot of the negative side effects but this time I haven&#039;t. I&#039;m hopeful that we will reach a dose that really removes the depression and I can start living my life again. I haven&#039;t noticed any weight gain , which is always a concern of mine. I&#039;m hopeful that this will be the one but  I&#039;ve also been hopeful in the past and have been let down."
