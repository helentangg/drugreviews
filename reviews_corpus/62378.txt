"I started this medication two weeks ago. The side effects those first few days were HORRIBLE. I was tired and felt high. I had dilated pupils and couldn&#039;t stop clenching my jaw. I called my doc. She said to just wait it out. I still get a tight jaw after taking the medication but I am a bit more relaxed and haven&#039;t been crying everyday. I am hopeful all of the side effects will go away and I will continue feeling better."
