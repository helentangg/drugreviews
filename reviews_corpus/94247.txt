"I&#039;ve been severely depressed for 10 years inc 2 hospital stays. My psychiatrist is excellent and suggested brintillex After I&#039;ve been on cymbalta for 2 years. Already so much less sleepy, more prone to complete tasks, not moping around all day and I have hope. Only one side effect is skin itching I can&#039;t seem to stop it! But other than that very happy. If you&#039;ve given up on life, the future, any chance of recovery give it a try."
