"Zoloft got rid of my anxiety (I have general anxiety) at 50 mg. At 75 Mg, my tics started improving greatly (lessening). Unfortunately though, Zoloft made me more depressed, in an apathetic way. I suspect it&#039;s the decrease in dopamine due to raising my serotonin. Dr is adding Wellbutrin. Maybe I&#039;ll get my sex drive back too (which Zoloft also squashed). Overall, for Anxiety, it works very well for me."
