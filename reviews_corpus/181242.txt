"I have had to come off Fluoxetine due to severe pains in my back , hips and legs. It&#039;s been 4 weeks and still getting the pain.   So worried I&#039;ve damaged myself for good.  Don&#039;t know what to do ! Doctor has put me on Naproxen for the pain, but how long do I take this for!? , has anyone else experienced this? Every time I come off naproxen I get the pain straight back again. Making me so unhappy."
