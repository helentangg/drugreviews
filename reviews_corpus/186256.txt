"Been on this for about a week. So far the pros are: I am much calmer. I have a very stressful job that used to have me yelling and wanting to pull my hair out. Now I&#039;m calmly discussing issues with a reasonable mind. Also I noticed I have more energy and much more positive outlook on life. I&#039;ve even lost a few pounds because my appetite is somewhat suppressed. The cons are: very vivid dreams. Just about every night I have a very lucid and lengthy dream about something in my life. Another con is the first few days I felt a little &quot;out of it&quot; as others have said, but that stopped after about 3-4 days. The last con is that it&#039;s expensive. I have two insurances and still had a copayment. But I like it so much, it&#039;s worth the price."
