"I am 20 and was suffering from anxiety and depression after &#039;recovering&#039; from an eating disorder. Pristiq made me feel so awful in the first 2 weeks but by week 3 I felt calm, I no longer snapped at people for no reason, I could concentrate during conversations and my university work has not suffered. I do feel like I find it harder to sleep (after 3 months on Pristiq) and if I miss a pill by a few hours I feel very, very drowsy. I have experienced no weight-gain BUT have had a notable increase in headaches and a few migraines. Overall the positive effects far outweigh the bad. "
