"Cymbalta is the best medication I have ever taken. After years of being treated for depression, I was re diagnosed as bipolar 2.5 years ago. I have been on an endless parade of SSRIs, and cymbalta controls my depression and anxiety better than anything else I&#039;ve tried. For the first couple of months I experienced some numbness and tremors in my hands and forearms, but not bad enough to stop the medication; they stopped after 2 or 3 months. I STRONGLY recommend you ask your doctor about Cymbalta."
