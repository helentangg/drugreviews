"I suffer from depression, back pain and anxiety that has been gradually getting worse.  I started taking nortriptyline and noticed a number of changes within 24 hours. I finally slept through the night.  My back pain dramatically improved and my anxiety lessened.  Sounds amazing right?  Well yes, but I was also crying all the time and felt even more depressed.  I also began having bad thoughts about hurting myself.  I have had bad thoughts in the past, but always had control of them.  These felt very different, I had no control of them.  

For some people this medicine is a miracle, but if you start to have thoughts that don%u2019t feel right when you start taking this medication, go to your doctor immediately."
