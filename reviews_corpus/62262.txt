"I may be premature giving Citalopram 9 out of 10. I started taking it 7 months after a dreadful bereavement, as I was experiencing severe reactive depression and rapid mood cycles for the first time in my life. I avoided antidepressants for as long as I could, but in the end, I felt I didn&#039;t have any choice as I was going under. Citalopram feels like nothing less than a life-saver. Few side effects initially apart from feeling very, very tired and getting a tight jaw. I still grieve, but I function, thankfully. Citalopram also seems to have got rid of my longstanding mild anxiety issues. I never want to go back to feeling like I did before."
