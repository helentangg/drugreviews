"I was on Lexapro for 6 years before it started to poop out. Besides panic disorder, I have some OCD and I am scared of taken medicine. So, when the doctor wanted me to try Celexa it took three months of therapy and hitting rock bottom before I took it. Well, 5 weeks later things are great. Virtually no panic attacks and it has reduce to obsessive compulsive disorder habits to a minimum. I did have loss of sex drive for the first three weeks, but I am back to normal now and my husband is happy. I was also very scared of gaining more weight. I gained 45 lbs on Lexapro but so far on Celexa I have lost 8 lbs. I hope this medicine never poops out on me."
