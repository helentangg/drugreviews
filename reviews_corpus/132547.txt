"Doxepin is a godsend for hives.

But I have found several drawbacks for it.
First, drowsiness. You need to take it before you go to bed. Probably even just slightly after dinner. Even then you will find yourself sluggish in the morning. 

Second, since it is an anti depressant, I tend to develop an I don&#039;t care attitude with it. My personality is to be that way normally and this exacerbates it. It isn&#039;t necessarily bad just something to be aware of.

Finally, I find it inhibits weight loss. It doesn&#039;t necessarily cause weight gain, but, it causes me to sweat less when exercising. When I get off it I tend to lose weight pretty rapidly.

But all the side effects are worth it to be hive free."
