"I was diagnosed with severe anterior bridging endophytis as well as facet joint arthropathy and some nuchal ossification in my cervical spine. Basically, my neck is fairly solid and I suffer intense pain shocks when lying down at night. The result was that I suffered from intense sleep deprivation and pain. I now take 10mg Amitriptyline. The result? Solid sleep every night, recovered energy levels and the large black bags beneath my eyes have dissipated. I used to wake up a couple of times each night to urinate, but now sleep for minimum 8 hours and usually awake bursting for the toilet!"
