"I have suffered terribly from social anxiety for the past 4 years. I am 23 years old, and once it started negatively affecting my performance at my first job out of college, I felt it necessary to do something. Was on Zoloft for a few months prior, but it suddenly stopped working. I was put on 50mg of Pristiq and I felt it working IMMEDIATELY. Right after I took the first pill I went into a foggy state, but that hasn&#039;t happened since. The first week I couldn&#039;t sleep past 4am, and the first morning I woke up with extreme nausea and vomited. I have been on Pristiq for about 6 weeks and really feel amazing. Work through the side effects, they will disappear and hopefully it will work as well for you!"
