"I&#039;ve suffered from severe social anxiety and depression for quite some time. I was always terrified of going on pills and wanted to figure it out mentally. I always denied I needed help. It&#039;s gotten so bad recently that I struggle to leave the house. I&#039;m only 17!! I went to the doctor and he prescribed me 10mg of Lexapro. I&#039;m an emetophobic and one of the possible side effects was nausea so that was almost a deal breaker for me. I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve experienced real side effects apart from difficulty reaching orgasm and headaches. My phobia makes me feel like I&#039;m gettin side effects when I&#039;m not- good old anxiety. Been on them for 2 days and am praying it gets better."
