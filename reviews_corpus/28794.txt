"I&#039;ve been using Lexapro for about 12 months for GAD and depression. I wish I had have started on it years ago. I walked away from a 10 year marriage 3 months after starting on it then took off overseas and reunited with the woman I should have married. Side effects were loss of libido at first but over time this improved. I tried to wean myself off it this year but after about 1 month my world started to darken once more. I think I will likely be on it for life and it has been a life saver for me. It does desensitize me to many emotions but these were damaging emotions to me and others around me. There is hope now."
