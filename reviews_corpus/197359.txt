"I developed an acute social anxiety disorder in my early 20&#039;s.  After trying 10mg of Paxil, my doctor upped the dose to 20mg.  I have been taking that dosage for the past 10 years.  My social anxiety is much more manageable than it was, although I still have my moments.  I hate to increase the dosage, however, because the sexual side effects have been bad for me.  Climax is next to impossible unless conditions are perfect, and even then it is a struggle.  My sex drive is also down, possibly because of the disappointment the lack of climax creates for me and my wife.  Personally, I am happy with the results of Paxil in terms of my social anxiety, but the sexual side effects are rough.  Good luck."
