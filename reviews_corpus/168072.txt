"I have suffered with Panic Attacks all my life but went undiagnosed until 1989.  I am now 58 and trust me when I tell you that there is no cure.  In my initial diagnosis I was started on Tofranil as an inpatient.  After my discharge from the hospital I went 5 entire years without having a panic attack.  When they resumed I had to be re-hospitalized and it was there I was put on Klonopin, which I have essentially been off of for a year. I am having constant panic attacks.  My daughter does not want me to resume Klonopin as when on it I slept all the time.
I did this search to see if Tofranil is still being used for panic disorder and I see that it is.  I plan to have my psychiatrist to put me back on it as it really worked."
