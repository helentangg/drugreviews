"I&#039;ve had panic attacks since 8th grade. I&#039;m 28 now and notice my anxiety about having a panic attack was getting overwhelming. I started to notice I was avoiding situations. I&#039;m a full time student and work part time. I need to do many speeches and I would worry about speeches from the time they were assigned. I&#039;ve been on citalopram 20mg for 2.5 weeks. I have no panic attacks and I have done two speeches with no issues! Side effects of nausea with yawning and sleepiness but those go away (1.5 weeks)then I noticed the change! Wish I started sooner."
