"Cymbalta has helped enough for me to justify taking it for both chronic pain and dysthymia but do not stop it suddenly!  I ran into a doctor vs Insurance problem and went cold turkey for a week and thought I would die.  Wean very slowly. If you stop this medicine or stop down to a SSRI then eliminate that.  It was the most horrible thing I had ever experienced.  It has helped me though."
