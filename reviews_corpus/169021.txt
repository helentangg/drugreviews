"I started using Viibryd about a week and a half ago.  First couple days great, no problem.  Went up to 20 mgs and weird side effects have started.  I constantly feel like I am going to vomit.  My legs are cramping and feels like I worked really hard which I haven&#039;t.  I&#039;m in pretty good shape, trim usually.  I am so bloated that I look like I am 3 months pregnant.  I&#039;m going back to the Prozac.  The side effects aren&#039;t worth it. "
