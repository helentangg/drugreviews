"I have taken this drug for over 20 years. Five years before starting it I had successfully reduced my symptoms using my knowledge of behavioural therapy by about 70% (I have a degree in Psychology). Before I took this drug my condition was well under control, I was happy, highly functioning and professionally succesfull. I took it to &quot;prove&quot; my OCD was a &quot;real&quot; illness. It gave me no benefit but I kept taking it. In the 15th year I became obsessively suicidal. Worse followed. I have been trying to get off the drug 5 years. I have become a dysfunctional, barely human wreck. Hallucinating, delusional, depressive, continually suicidal. My deficits are innumerable and far worse than ever before I took it. It has literally destroyed my life."
