"I was given 10mg of citalopram by my gp last year but still haven&#039;t tried it.  I know its stupid because I have suffered from anxiety and stress for 30 yrs  I lost my husband in October  last year on my birthday. I live alone and worry about everything.  Because I don&#039;t cope very well with tablets I am really scared of bad side effects and no one here to help me . I know there is only me who can decide what to do but why these meds have such side effects baffles because thats the very thing you are taking them for. I am British and found this website ."
