"It works great! after only 3 days I am beginning to feel the effects.  Unlike what is said for side effects, my sex drive is way back up where it should be (17 year old guy here), probably because the decrease in anxiety.  I feel a little loopy from it, and maybe a little more anxious feeling while I&#039;m adjusting, but the constant OCD worry and panic from anxiety is gone, and I feel like I can function way better and I feel kinda normal in public places like stores again. 9/10 only because of one nasty side effect:  INSOMNIA I love staying up but once in a while I need my deep sleep."
