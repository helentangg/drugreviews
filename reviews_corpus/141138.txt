"Hello people, my name is Alex, I&#039;m 22 years old and I suffered from GAD (generalized anxiety disorder) a panic disorder and major depression. I started a dosage of 10mg escitalopram sandoz roughly 2 months ago, and it&#039;s definetly made a difference. The first week/ two weeks I had relatively bad headaches, loose bowel movements and somewhat increased anxiety (I was however, recovering from a panic attack which could have caused the anxiety.)
Then it took roughly another two weeks (4 weeks total) before I started noticing changes. I became happier, more relaxed and I haven&#039;t had a panic attack since I started my dose. Prior to seeking help, I had next to 0 sexual libido, and surprisingly my libido is increased. 9/10, still get anxious sometim"
