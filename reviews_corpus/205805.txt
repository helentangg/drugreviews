"Diagnosed with Fibromyalgia several months ago, probably have had the symptoms for more than a year.  Cymbalta made me a zombie, Pristiq has been an answer to prayer.  I am pretty much pain free, unless I exert myself or sometimes just have a bad day.  But, the good days far outweigh the bad.  Still nap occasionally, still have insomnia occasionally, but am totally happy with the way I feel."
