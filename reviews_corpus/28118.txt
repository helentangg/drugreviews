"I&#039;m taking Cipralex.
I was in a car accident and about a year after the accident I started getting anxiety. 
My background: I was in the military and grew up on a farm. I was raised to be tough and to deal with my problems head on myself.
The whole anxiety thing I thought was for weak people. People with weak minds who just couldn&#039;t handle life. The funny thing with anxiety is it does not make sense. 
I was always an outgoing person up for anything at the drop of a dime.
I started getting anxiety just talking to people and around my family. I would get these episodes of feeling like I was out of my body and spaced out. Not knowing how to respond or thinking the person I was talking to knew I was really anxious.
Cipralex has saved me"
