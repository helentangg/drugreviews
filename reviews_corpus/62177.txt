"I just started taking Celexa and the only thing I notice are the headaches, which are very unusual for me. Sometimes they are worse than others. Can be distracting at work, but not so bad that I&#039;m willing to through in the towel just yet. Also my stomach as been a little upset too, but again not enough to give up on trying to feel better!"
