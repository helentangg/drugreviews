"After years of non-medicinal attempts to deal with my SAD, I finally decided to give it a shot as it had been really bad the last three years. My doctor put me on fluoxetine at 20 mg and then moved it up to 40 mg. On the positive side it made me less prone to angry outbursts and my lows weren&#039;t as bad. I&#039;ve stopped taking it due to side effects. I had some initial insomnia but adjusted. However, a few days into 40 mg I could only manage 4 hours sleep a night. I would be restless and anxious. My mind would be racing and wouldn&#039;t relax despite the fact that the rest of my body was exhausted. I also had trouble getting and maintaining an erection. Not being able to be intimate with my wife or sleep well made me depressed, so what&#039;s the point?"
