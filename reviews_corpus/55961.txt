"I&#039;ve been taking 25mg twice a day for about 6 weeks and have experienced no side effects whatsoever. I feel normal and competent for the first time in years. Prozac and Celexa both gave me such bad dreams that I had to discontinue them. That being said, I consider my anxiety and depression to be largely situational and temporary, and I hope eventually to be drug-free."
