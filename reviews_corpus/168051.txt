"This medication saved my life! I&#039;ve only been taking it for almost 2 weeks but I was thrilled at the fast response I had to it! I&#039;ve literally tried almost every other antidepressant without much success for over 20 years - for my debilitating panic disorder/GAD/depression. Thank you to the Dr who started me on this recently while I was hospitalized for a suicide attempt. I can now leave my home without any fear or anxiety; my panic attacks/panic are literally gone! I feel like a new person! The only side effects I&#039;ve had so far are dry mouth/dry eyes and a bit of tachycardia. It also helps me sleep for once; I take it at bedtime. I was titrated up to the 100mg dose once at bedtime. I cannot emphasize enough how happy I am to have this!"
