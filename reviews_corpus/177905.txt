"I&#039;ve had Frozen Shoulder for 8 months.  If you aren&#039;t familiar with frozen shoulder, it is not only inconvenient because of the inability to move your arm, it is terribly painful.  It takes usually about 12 to 24 months to get over it, and I&#039;ve been on Vicodin, Tramodol, Advil and other pain killers for this, while doing physical therapy.  I also have a topical prescription compound for my pain.  I was at my wit&#039;s end when my doctor came up with the idea of Cymbalta.  It seems to have been a great idea.  I have a little dry mouth, but I am about 80 percent pain free.  I still can&#039;t &#039;Move&#039; my arm, but with physical therapy, that will come in time.  It used to hurt (REALLY HURT) 24/7!"
