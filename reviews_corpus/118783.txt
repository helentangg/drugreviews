"I started Zoloft 2 years ago and was taking 100 mg daily. I quit cigarettes cold Turkey and figured I cold do the same with Zoloft. I probably have 3 or 4 days left till its out completely. Good thing no one crossed me in two weeks. Everytime you begin to get upset a surge races through your brain. Don&#039;t be like me. Wean off the right way."
