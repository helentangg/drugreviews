"I started taking escitalopram for severe anxiety and depression. The initial side effects really sucked. I couldn&#039;t work, was constantly tired, clenched and shaky jaw. I wasn&#039;t &quot;there&quot; for about the first 3 weeks on 10mg, I went up to 20mg after 1 month of 10mg. I&#039;m now on week 9 of treatment and feeling better than I ever have before. No more anxiety, panic attacks or locking myself away in my room. I&#039;m actually getting up and doing things again. I&#039;m daydreaming and not dwelling on the negatives anymore. It has completely switched my mindset. Feels as though I&#039;ve come out from underneath a dark cloud and can see, feel and hear again. Has worked absolute wonders for me personally. I cannot cry and feel a bit emotionally masked though."
