"I was given Cymbalta in October to help with chronic back pain from a spinal fusion surgery due to no one catching a 33 degree scoliosis curve which was also affecting my breathing. My mother passed in September, so my PAIN SPECIALIST decided I needed something for anxiety/depression AND pain..ya think? So he told me to take it for a few weeks and tell him if I like it, and if I think it helps.

Well, no mood lifting, no pain relief. Luckily I had no side effects to speak of, so I am sorry for those of us that doctors just hand meds to without explaining anything. Yes, he just prescribed them, and said &quot;They should help.&quot; NO warnings, then we get the effects and they look at us like we are crazy.

He tried to give me Cymbalta a second time!"
