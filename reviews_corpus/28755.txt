"If you just started Lexapro and are considering quitting because of the side effects - don&#039;t! Trust me. Wait it out. It gets so much better. The first month I took Lexapro, I was extremely nauseous and anxious, and couldn&#039;t sleep at night. I&#039;ve been on it now for six months and feel like a completely new, better person. The only side effect I experience is occasional drowsiness. I can sleep at night, I have no sexual side effects, and I haven&#039;t gained any weight. Also: Do NOT taper off this medicine without consulting your Doctor first and having him/her help you through it. If you take yourself off it (especially cold turkey) it will be horrible for you. Be smart and stay strong. The good definitely outweighs the bad."
