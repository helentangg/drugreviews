"It worked very well for me six years ago.  I had depression, little sleep and anxiety.   I was off within a year but panic attacks have struck in recent weeks so I am hoping for a similar experience.  A recent post was hoping for a two week improvement which is not how this drug or any ssri I know of works.  It did work fairly quickly as I recall.  I felt much better in 2-4 weeks and was able to make necessary life work changes within months.  Calling it a lifesaver sounds about right to me."
