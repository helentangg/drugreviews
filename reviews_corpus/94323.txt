"I&#039;ve been on Brintellix for 10 weeks and notice an appreciable benefit in my mood, but the side effect serious weight gain (approx 12 lbs in that time) and serious nausea &amp; headache about 30 minutes after taking my 20mg tab, no matter when I take it during the day or with how much food. (Noticed best with my biggest meal) While my mood is definitely better (no more suicidal thinking or attempts) I still don&#039;t feel like my old self. Kind of a medium with no real highs or lows. I can smile, laugh and cry, but just don&#039;t feel like me. Obviously, this is soooo much better than being suicidal, but I&#039;d really like to find a better fix, especially because of the weight gain. Other minor side effects are mild &amp; occasional all over body itchiness."
