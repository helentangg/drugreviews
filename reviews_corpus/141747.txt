"I have only been taking it for a couple days and I feel a little irritable and I sleep very well. I&#039;m only twenty. But I have postpartum depression, I have had two kids. I hope that after a couple of weeks it starts getting better. I tried Cymbalta but the side effects were bad. I was irritable and could not sleep and I was tied all the time."
