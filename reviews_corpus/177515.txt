"i have been battling with major depression since I was a child. I have been on many different types of medications over the years. I also have a major case of obsessive compulsive disorder and as I I&#039;m getting older it has been getting severely worse. Everything has to be in perfect order I spend hours upon hours a day making sure everything is order. It&#039;s so bad that I can not even have garbage in my garbage cans if so I have to clean the cans immediately. It has become so bad that it cuts into other daily activities such as spending time with my wife, family and friends . Some days I do not even attempt to get out of bed. Some days I will sleep for well over 24 hours. These are the medications in taking daily . I take 150 mg of Lamotrigine"
