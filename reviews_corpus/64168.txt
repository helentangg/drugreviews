"VA diagnosed PTSD, MDD, GAD.

I had an awful experience with lexapro and went to the va for another option. They started me off on 12.5mg of Zoloft/sertraline every other day to ease my transition into the medication.

First time I took it the next day I woke up and had a big grin on my face the whole day. 

I have since gone upto 25mg and have had nothing but great experiences.

Side effects are diarrhea and some nausea upon waking, but coffee and walking around seem to fix that right up.

Everyone is different but Zoloft has saved my life from becoming a giant pit of despair"
