"I have been on so many anti-depressant medications over the last 20 years. I have never had anything make me feel better and so quickly. I was given 50 mg a day for approximately 1 month and then my doctor upped me to 100 mg ER a day, which I take first thing in the morning. Let me tell you I haven&#039;t been this cheery and upbeat for 20 years. I really mean this seriously I can&#039;t believe that this medication makes me feel so good and its also suppressed my appetite. What could be better than that?"
