"I have been on Cymbalta for about four months. My doctor switched me from Zoloft to Cymbalta after I continued to experience panic attacks. Fortunately, Cymbalta worked great! My panic attacks went away and my mood swings seemed to calm down. But, about a month ago I decided that I wanted to come off of Cymbalta because my husband and I are trying to get pregnant. That&#039;s when things went down hill. Instead of tapering off of the medicine (which is not what my doctor said I would have to do) I just stopped cold turkey. I began to experience severe headaches, insomnia, nausea, tingling in my hands and face, I also began to hallucinate and the worst part has been the brain zaps."
