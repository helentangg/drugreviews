"This drug has been the best Anti-Depressant/Anti-Anxiety medication I have ever been on. I have been off and on different medications for the past 10 years. (Prozac, Wellbutrin, Cipralex)
The first 2 weeks on this medication were rough with nausea and vomiting. My doctor encourage me to push through the first two weeks which I did. After 2 weeks the nausea went away and haven&#039;t had any side effects since. It&#039;s the first medication I have felt a notable different with. My anxiety is very low. No more tightening chest, vomiting, diarrhea, not being able to breath when in a situation that would previously make me anxious. Only butterflies in my stomach now. I have never felt better in my life. Very optimistic. Is this what normal feels like."
