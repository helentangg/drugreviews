"I am 26 years old and have suffered depression since I was a teenager. Over the years my depression has gotten worse - I was having &#039;breakdowns&#039; more frequently and for longer periods (at least twice a year, and I was out of action for a month or two at a time). I became extremely depressed at the beginning of this year and was suicidal. As a nurse, I am a terrible patient and refused to be admitted. With some negotiation with my GP, I was put on Pristiq 150mg and Mirtazepine 30mg daily. It has taken a few months but I am finally feeling like &#039;me&#039; again. I can honestly say I have had zero side effects with Pristiq. Without the aid of this medication I can honestly say I don&#039;t think I&#039;d be here today."
