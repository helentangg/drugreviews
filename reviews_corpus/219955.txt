"Ive been taking this for about 3 1/2 years. It works great for what I take it for. The only problem I have, which is a huge problem, is increased appetite and weight gain. I&#039;m actually gonna start a different medication for nerve pain. Amitriptyline has helped but I&#039;m also battling obesity. This medication doesn&#039;t help at all in that area. Im still young, mid 30s. So maybe I&#039;ll resume taking it when I&#039;m in my 60s or 70s. I wont care so much then about the weight gain. "
