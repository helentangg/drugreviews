"I wonder if anyone can relate to my experience with Paxil. During about 17 years of severe depression and anxiety, no medication (I&#039;ve tried them all) seemed to help and the ones that did, brought along unbearable side effects. ECT didn&#039;t help either. Paxil is the only pill that really works for me, but it makes me slightly manic. Combining it with a mood stabiliser works perfect %u2013 but only for 6 months. After that, it&#039;s depression all over again. After waiting for another 6 months, I can start using Paxil in combination with a mood stabiliser again, with good results that always only lasts for 6 months. This 6 months on/6 months off has become a very predictable pattern over the years. "
