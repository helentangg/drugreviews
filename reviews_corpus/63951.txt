"I take Sertraline for depression and anxiety and while it works well, it also gives me insomnia and my jaw shakes a lot during the day. I almost feel high when I wake up (due to taking my tablet just before I go to bed to try and stop the insomnia) and for the first week or so I felt sick and was heaving constantly however this wore off within a week. That being said, I don&#039;t feel upset or anxious anymore, but I don&#039;t feel happy either. I just feel like I can get through the day and it&#039;s nice to not be crying and feeling scared all day :)"
