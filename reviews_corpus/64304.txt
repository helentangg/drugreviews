"I feel like I&#039;m starting to come to grips with my life again. It&#039;s taken a while and I&#039;ve been unemployed but hope to secure employment with how happy and upbeat I am with life now. I can only hope things get better, but as we all know, shit will get worse but I think I&#039;ll be able to deal with it now. I&#039;m starting to gain the confidence I had when I was 18-19. started the gym at the start of the year, havent been in about 3 weeks but a job and the gym and I think I&#039;ll be good.  reading a lot of these comments on here it seems that people aren&#039;t giving sertraline a chance. I started off on 50mg, upped to 100mg after a month. its been a long road on the 100mg but my gran and friends have noticed improvements in my happiness"
