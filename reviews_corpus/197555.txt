"It&#039;s completely allowed me to be myself around people and even post things like this on the internet. I started at 10mg and was able to call people I knew and walk from my car to places without overwhelming stress. I still felt a little bit of anxiety, but now at 20mg my life is a world apart from where I used to be. When I began using paroxetine I did have the nausea and increased sweating, which wasn&#039;t very pleasant but believe me it gets better and is worth it."
