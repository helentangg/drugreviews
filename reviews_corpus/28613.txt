"I have been on Lexapro since August of 2009.  Initially the OCD went away altogether but it has recently returned as of July 2011.  I&#039;m pregnant in my third trimester so it may not be working as well due to body chemistry changes of pregnancy.  But, I&#039;m not sure if it could also not be working as well due to what is informally known as &quot;Prozac poopout&quot; which according to my psychiatrist may happen to some patients anywhere from possibly a year but may not happen until 30 years on the medicine.  Time will only tell if Lexapro will continue to work for me.  I&#039;m not sure what to do if it stops working completely.  I am also on Seroquel to help with the symptoms and help me sleep since SSRI&#039;s tend to keep me up at night."
