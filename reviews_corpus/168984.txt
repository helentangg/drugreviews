"Really wanted this to work and I stuck it out through the first month. However, this medicine caused my blood pressure to stay elevated. I also experienced worsening anxiety and did not sleep more than one or two hours at the time. By the end of the first month I felt like I was worse off than before as far as anxiety, blood pressure and sleeplessness. That&#039;s just my experience though."
