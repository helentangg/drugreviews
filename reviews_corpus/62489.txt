"I have found that this medication has caused me to have a chronic bad bad cough! When I cut down from 20mg to 10mg the cough improved and when I came off it for nearly 2 months the cough went. But I became so ill in that I did not want to live anymore so had to go back on it. Needless to say the cough has returned with a vengeance! Time to see the Doctor and find an alternative."
