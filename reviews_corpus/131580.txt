"After years of Social Anxiety/Panic attacks I had to sort myself out. I did some research into SNRIs/SSRIs and like many, was fearful of the side effects described by others and how bad it made people feel.

I went to the GP who prescribed Venlafaxine/Effexor.

The first few weeks I felt a little nausea, increased anxiety/panic attacks, delay in ejaculation. It never felt unmanageable. After 6 weeks all had gone.

I feel 80% less anxious in social/all situations, I feel calm and very much unphased by most things. I feel more confident, my mind is clearer and it is physically impossible to dwell on negative thoughts. Haven&#039;t had a panic attack!

Everyone reacts differently. I believed it a risk worth taking and I feel it has paid off!"
