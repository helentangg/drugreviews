"This medicine is quite calming makes it very easy to fall asleep at night. Also made me feel nicer to family members.  However it comes with weight gain and craving sugary foods. Also constipation and I swear it gave me a 3 week long heavy period, but who knows if that&#039;s related. All in all it was nice. I only took for a month or so because I didn&#039;t want to get fatter. "
