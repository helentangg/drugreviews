"I have been dealing with depression for well Over 6 months and just about 2 months ago decided to go to the doctor to seek help with medication to bridge back to benign myself. I first tried Viibryd for a month, worked well for me emotionally and for my moods but I gained weight which triggered deeper depression for me. I am now trying this Brintillex stuff. I have had severe itching throughout my entire body, it gets worse when I&#039;m sitting still and trying to fall asleep at night. I&#039;ll be itching my back and legs so hard in my sleep that it wakes me. I have only been on this drug for a month! Totally not worth it. Not to mention the vomiting which makes everything so much worse. I hate the medication guessing game that comes along with this."
