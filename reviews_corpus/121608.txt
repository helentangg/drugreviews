"Took Venlafaxine ER with 20-25mg Adderall XR (to reduce fatigue) for ~2 months for MDD/severe social anxiety. PROS: Not sure about depression but noticed a significant decrease in anxiety.

I could sleep 12-14 hours   naps and be physically/mentally fatigued 24/7. Started taking it and lied awake in bed 6-8 hours until I decided to just get up. Started to concern me after a few weeks.
