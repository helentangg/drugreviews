"I take 20mg a day. Has helped with depression, anger and anxiety. Also has helped with stressing over things I shouldn&#039;t stress over. I don&#039;t mind (as much) going out and being around a lot of people if I have to now. Only negative side effect I&#039;ve experienced is when having sex its sometimes impossible to orgasm"
