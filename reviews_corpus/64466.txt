"I have constant mid-level depression and have also self medicated this with marijuana, helps a lot but only if you smoke all the time  so I decided to go to the docter and right away he started me off with 100mg zoloft and I just tried this for the next month, the first 2 weeks my emotions were uncontrollable happy, sad, angry, numb, energetic, then tired. So then after the 2 weeks I didn&#039;t feel depressed really but didn&#039;t feel happy either?just a neutral feeling. So i stopped and decided medical marjiuana works better for me."
