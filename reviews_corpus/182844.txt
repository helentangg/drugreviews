"Just started taking this med 5 days ago after 5 years on Celexa. Celexa always left me at an &quot;I&#039;m fine&quot; state and I just said that &quot;I just am older, so I shouldn&#039;t expect to have the energy I had in high school&quot; (I&#039;m 26). Two months ago, my meds seemed to stop working all together. My doc decided we should counter-taper meds between Celexa and Cymbalta.  Day one of Cymbalta on the lowest dose, I felt absolutely amazing. I have all of my full range of emotions and so much energy and concentration! For about 8 hours on Day 2, my eyebrow would twitch on and off, but that&#039;s gone. I&#039;m planning on discussing with my doc about keeping the low dose (he suggested one up) and just completely getting rid of Celexa and see how that works. I&#039;m ecstatic!"
