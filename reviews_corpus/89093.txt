"Sure just take a pill and your life is going to be good. I went to the doctor for sleep and said I was stressed, so they give me an antidepressant. People don&#039;t realize this stuff changes your brain and is bad for you. You just need exercise and good nutrition and it will change your life (I think). I&#039;m only going to try it for two weeks just to feel what people are saying they feel. The doctor should have given me xanax or something simaliar. I&#039;ve seen some antidepressants do some bad nasty things to people. Not to mention these side effects they cause."
