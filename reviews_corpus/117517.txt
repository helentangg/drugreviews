"I have been taking 10mg then upped it to 25mg nightly since October. Now I&#039;m not sure if it was migraines I was actually having. I am on holiday in Australia from New Zealand and was on a short trip on the plane from Sydenham to the Gold Coast, 10 minutes in and the light through the bind was too bright so I took 100 mg Sumitriptan as they are pretty fast working but not this time. I lost my vision straight away and ended up having emergency surgery up my nose on a burst pituarty gland so close to my Brain it was bleeding and only so much removed, it benign thank goodness but I&#039;m blind in my right eye possibly permanent and only about 20% vision in my left eye with no left vision and it could take at least a year to function properly."
