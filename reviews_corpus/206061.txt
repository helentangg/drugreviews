"I have been on Pristiq for about 2 months. I&#039;ve tried probably 10-12 other anti-depressents with lots of side effects that made me want to quit them. I feel better emotionally today. I have no side effects and I am able to complete tasks in a reasonable amount of time, without feeling overwhelmed. I have no anxiety issues and I am finally enjoying my life. I only wish the insurance industry would cover this medication."
