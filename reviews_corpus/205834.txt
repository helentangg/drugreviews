"I was only on Pristiq for 3 days before I had to stop taking it cold turkey. I&#039;ve dealt with restless leg syndrome since my childhood (I&#039;m now 20), but it would only affect me once or maybe twice per year. Out of the 3 days of taking Pristiq, I suffered from terrible restless legs while trying to sleep for 2 nights. I think the 2nd day I took it I had already experienced a bit more energy and felt sort of happier and less stressed, but unfortunately I cannot continue to take it due to the negative side effect.

By the way, I know it&#039;s bad to stop taking anything cold turkey, and I&#039;m currently suffering from that as well because my doctor hasn&#039;t returned my calls regarding the issue in 4 days. "
