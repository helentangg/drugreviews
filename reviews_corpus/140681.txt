"Lexapro changed my life. I have had IBS since I was a teenager. It caused me great anxiety and fear of going anywhere because I just knew I was going to need a bathroom urgently. When I turned 40 it got so bad  I could not make it to work without having a horrible stomach ache which would cause me to panic and have an anxiety attack. Within a week of taking 5mg lexapro a day I was a new person. I feel more like myself on than off it. I have been on it for 4 years. I tried to go off it once and the diarrhea returned. The side effects for me were low libido, a little weight gain, less irritable but anger more severe, tired after taking which coffee cures. The side effects decreased over time. Overall the benefits far out way the side effects."
