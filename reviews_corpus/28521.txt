"I had clinical depression and anxiety before, 1996-2001. I had taken Paxil, Remeron, Effexor and about 3 others I can&#039;t remember. None of them worked for me. And the doc always said give it 6 weeks to take effect. That was all hell for me. Then I felt the symptoms that I recognized from before coming on again about 2 weeks ago. I jumped early this time. My doc asked me what medication worked for me before. I told her Effexor, somewhat. She prescribed that for me. Two days of a deeper depression and higher anxiety on it. I called her today after reading online about how good Lexapro was. She prescribed it for me 5mg dose. I took it about four hours ago. I feel great now! I kid not."
