"This is my second time on effexor in the 7 months. I began taking 34.5mg in June 2015 then it was upped to 75mg after 2 weeks. The first week the side effects were really bad but they only lasted the one week and then I felt great. Best thing I ever did but then I started feeling better to the point I didn&#039;t even think about the medication and missed about 4 doses before I noticed. After missing that many I just stopped taking it. 
About a month later the depression was back and worse than ever.  I just got put back on it, started last night and the side effects are back but I have to push through because I know they are temporary and if I have to feel dizzy and nauseated for a week for the depression to lesson it&#039;s worth it to me."
