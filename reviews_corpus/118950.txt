"I have depression and anxiety, lately more depression, from being 40, with kids, uncomfortable marriage.  Lexapro has suppressed things but I had become unemotional. On 50mg for a week now of Zoloft and the difference is incredible! I have reasonable emotions, and more energy to want to do the things I planned on but didn&#039;t do before. Sleeping is off and on a problem, has always been, but dreams are waking me up for being so vivid.  Appetite is down, I&#039;m glad. I had been steadily gaining weight because I didn&#039;t want to do anything, but now stomach is bad and I&#039;m scared to go anywhere.  Hoping that will go away.  Can&#039;t say much about sex, not having any."
