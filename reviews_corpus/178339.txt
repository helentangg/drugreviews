"I have had chronic pain from nerve damage when I had a mastectomy 11 yrs ago. Have been to many pain doctors, tried epilepsy medicines, antidepressants, and now I am taking Tizanidine, Lyrica, Cymbalta and a wonderful compounded pain cream that is a lifesaver for me! It has Lidocaine, Ketoprofen, and Cyclobenzaprine. Mention to your pain doctor. I put a small dab on my arthritic knee too. My insurance covers it 90%. Good luck to all with chronic pain!"
