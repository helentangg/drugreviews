"I started taking this medication about eight weeks ago for increased anxiety (likely aggravated by menopause).  It was affecting my life greatly.  Side effects of blurred vision, low sex drive and sweats were extreme. I kept questioning whether or not I would get past the side effects, especially the sweating as I was starting to feel better.  Thankfully they all passed except for the low sex drive.  That bothers me a bit but not enough to change meds and I feel amazing.  Heading back to work next week and actually looking forward to it.  I also realized I probably should have been on this medication a long time ago.  Hang in there for at least eight weeks before giving up due to side effects."
