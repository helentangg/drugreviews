"I have been on Zoloft for about two months the lowest dose and have had wonderful help on it with therapy! I had severe panic attacks daily , depression and I had withdrawn from life and fun! I am improving daily and see the light again but I believe you have to do your part with therapy and find the triggers to the anxiety to truly heal but this medicine has helped me get out of the dark place !!!"
