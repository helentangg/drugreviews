"Lexapro has been a lifesaver!  Started on prozac for 8 weeks but did not work for me.  Doctor switched me to Lexapro 3 weeks ago and I feel calm and relaxed for the first time in a long time. Only taking 20mg but really helps with sleep and making healthy rational decisions. I highly recommend and had no side effects."
