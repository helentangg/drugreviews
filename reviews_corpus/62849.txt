"I&#039;m only taking 10 mg of Celexa but it has helped. I still get anxious but I realize it as it begins now and can control the feeling by breathing and taking a walk, which I could not do before.  I also take 25 mg of Xanax at night before bed. Celexa works slowly but I have not had one bad side effect. Eventually my goal is to eliminate the Xanax."
