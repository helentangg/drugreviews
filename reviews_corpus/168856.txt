"I have been on this medicine at varying doses. I&#039;m taking 30 mg now. I&#039;ve suffered bouts of depression and anxiety for many years. When I started this medicine I did the starter pack and thought it was great until day 4 of the 40mg. Had hallucinations while driving and luckily I was close to home. Passed out at home and had vivid dreams in a semiconscious state for about 7 hours, Called doctor and he said drop back down to 20. I have made a couple of attempts to move the dose up as it doesn&#039;t seem to be enough at 20. I&#039;ve been hospitalized once with serotonin syndrome on day 21 of the 40mg. Brain zaps are the worst! Heat on top of my head is bad. Miss a dose even by a couple hours and anger and crying BAD. I am not happy with it now and plan to get off it."
