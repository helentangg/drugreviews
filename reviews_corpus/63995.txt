"I have just finished sertraline after being on it for three years. My doses ranged between 100-200mg throughout this time. 
I think I developed some sort of tolerance to it because I stopped as they were not working as effectively as they had been.
Overall though... side effects at beginning were terrible for sertraline and lasted 12 weeks for me but I stuck it out. The increased anxiety during this period was the hardest, along with clammy/sweaty hands.
Sertraline gave me palpitations the whole time I took them though
Benzo use dropped after the 3 month mark, this is typically when I know an antidepressant is starting to do its work. 
As I said, steadily increased dose and it worked fine for few years then therapeutic effects began to wear off."
