"In &#039;97 I was suffering from depression so badly, I entered a clinical trial for antidepressants. Specifically, Effexor XR. I had never been on antidepressants before and I was astounded at how much better I felt. Then in &#039;06, after the 2nd work supervisor said I had &quot;no sense of urgency&quot; I decided to switch medicines. My doctor said so many patients became apathetic after long term use. Getting off was a nightmare! But now I&#039;m on Lexapro. It hasn&#039;t lifted me up like I&#039;d like either, but maybe that&#039;s the way it&#039;s going to be. I experienced weight gain with Effexor and actually lost weight since I&#039;ve been on Lexapro, which has been for about 2 years now. Would like to get off all medicines period."
