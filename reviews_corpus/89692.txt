"I tried Lexapro prior to Celexa and it really revved up my anxiety.  I was afraid Celexa would do the same since it is almost the same medication, but Celexa seemed to calm me down a bit. I believe that was because of the inactive part of it.  It is only the first day but I feel subdued. My main problem was restlessness, so I needed an antidepressant that would settle me down more so than perk me up.  Settling down would essentially perk me up. If that makes sense. So far so good."
