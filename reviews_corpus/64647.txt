"I don&#039;t have enough experience to give a proper rating but I have suffered with social anxiety disorder my whole life and was put on these pills 2 years ago, I only took them for 2 months though. They made me have trouble sleeping and they messed up my libido which for me was the worst part but about 4-6 weeks in, I was at college and some people sat at my desk in the common  room (this is something that would usually cause a panic attack) and I didn&#039;t even care, absolutely no anxiety but when I stopped taking them it came back so now I&#039;m gonna see if doc will put me back on them"
