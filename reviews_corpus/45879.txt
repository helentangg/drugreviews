"I was prescribed this at 13 years old after attempting suicide and took it for about 3 years. I didn&#039;t feel so depressed, but I didn&#039;t feel happy either. I don&#039;t think it was all that effective at combating my depression. They kept increasing the dosage to see if more would work better, but it got to the point where the dose would be toxic for my body size so I was switched to a different drug. I am now 20, off all medications and have never felt better."
