"I have been taking this medication since I was 19 due to panic attacks, anxiety &amp; dissociation that came from my brother being diagnosed with a terrible mental health disorder. Since taking it, It&#039;s worked like a charm, I&#039;m now 25 and am still on the medication. This SSRI is so mild and gentle &amp; I have 0 side effects. Please try this medication! My panic attacks are gone, my anxiety is minimal and my dissociation has disappeared. Please don&#039;t be ashamed to take something your brain may need. I&#039;m now a Registered Nurse &amp; I&#039;m so calm and happy and have my life back from anxiety and panic. Please give this a try! Oh and I&#039;m currently on 20mg. Also, remember there is always hope. Praying for everyone who reads this."
