"Viibryd has honestly changed my life for the better. I&#039;ve had depression and anxiety for 5 years. I was going to therapy (and I still do), but it was recommended I try some medication because I was not really feeling any better and I was very hesitant. I did 5mg for 2 weeks, 10mg for a week, 20mg for a week, and now I&#039;m on 40mg. I experience NO side effects. No diarrhea or nausea like most people have at the beginning. Not only did my anxiety come under control when I started the 20mg, but I feel happy now. My sex drive has been normal and I&#039;ve actually lost weight since I started Viibryd since I don&#039;t have the urge to eat everything now. It&#039;s definitely worth a try."
