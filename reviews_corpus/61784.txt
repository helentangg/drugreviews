"I have always struggled with depression but after giving birth my depression spiraled out of control. I was miserable every second of the day. My husband finally told me I make an appointment or he makes it for me. I started off at 10mg of Celexa, and was moved up to 20mg. It has completely turned my life around. I finally feel like I&#039;m living again. I haven&#039;t had any side effects other than minor headaches."
