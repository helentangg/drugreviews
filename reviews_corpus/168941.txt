"I couldn&#039;t stop crying and this medicine made me stop.
When it starts to wear off I know because I feel the tears coming back. I only take 5mg a day but have to increase at weeks end due to being tired so I increase to 7.5mg (break the pill) then go back to 5 mg on Monday.  It works for me.  Only negative is a small craving for cigarettes.  My Doc gave it to me for free.  Hope insurance covers it."
