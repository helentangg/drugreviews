"I&#039;ve been taking Lexapro for about 2 months now.  I have suffered from social anxiety all of my life and finally went to the doctor to get help.  It was the best thing I ever did.  I now can function and feel normal.  I didn&#039;t have any bad side effects from the medicine and have been very pleased with the results.  My day to day life is not filled with me avoiding many situations and I now feel &quot;normal&quot;.  I never expected this medication to work.  My only regret is I didn&#039;t get help sooner."
