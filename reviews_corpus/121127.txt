Until the last 5 years after loss and my fair share of medical issues leaving me overcome with severe anxiety and depression. Fast forward today my physian petscribed Effexor 25mg. In the past 5 years have tried others with side effects. I&#039;m only on day  5  and feeling so tired and have mild diareeha and some little anxious feeling. The tiredness is profound.
