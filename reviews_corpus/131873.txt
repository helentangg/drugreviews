"I started taking it about 3 months ago. It really changed things for me especially with depression. Anxiety wise it has definitely made an improvement. The only complaint is that I think my libido is dropping. I started taking 150mg per day a week ago.
Anyway, if you are in absolute despair I would recommend this medication."
