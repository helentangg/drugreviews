"This is one of the most under rated drugs for depression.  I found it myself and every time I mention it to a new doctor, they have never heard of it.  I am afraid they will someday stop making it, which would be a tragedy. It saved my life--multiple times--when NOTHING else worked.  I&#039;d had every SSRI in the book thrown at me (because, OF COURSE if one doesn&#039;t work, SURELY another of the same type will).  No weight gain--actual loss. Pulls me out of suicidal despair within a few hours. I still have a bottle for emergencies.  For me, however, as a longterm treatment, it would start making me apathetic--not lethargic, just kind of nonchalant. After 3 days on it, I would want to quit my job. Fast acting, low side effects, mildly energizing."
