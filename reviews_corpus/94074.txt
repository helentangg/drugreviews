"I have been on a lot of different medications for Depression. Some were awful and terrible, while others were ok or tolerable, and there was even one where I thought that was as good as it&#039;s going to get. I was on that a long time. Then, my doctor suggested this. Wow! I can think clearly!! It&#039;s definitely a great medication. I have yet to see side effects and I&#039;ve been taking it for about 6 months."
