"Day 5 and I&#039;m amazed already, the depression and anxiety has been wiped away with 30mg. By far the best antidepressant I&#039;ve tried in the last 2 years. Feel so much better, better mood, less irritable and more energetic. Wonder drug for me. I&#039;d highly recommend trying it, no side effects just a slight occasional headache but otherwise no complaints here."
