"Life saver! I feel that I was possibly depressed for maybe a decade or less, but soon after my father passed away about two years ago- I hit rock bottom. I was EXTREMELY depressed. I just couldn&#039;t function emotionally, physically, etc. I would sleep all the time. I just overall felt like life was not exciting anymore and that I lost my sense of identity or having a purpose! Not only did my fathers passing cause me to become more depressed, but lots of other MAJOR traumatic stressors hit me all at once too. So, I had and still have a lot going on. BUT since I have been taking Prozac (only 10mg)- I am alive again and HAPPY! I just feel normal. I don&#039;t cry anymore. I feel amazing. Oh and no side effects at all! Just happiness."
