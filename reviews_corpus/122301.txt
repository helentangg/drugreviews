"After trials of many many medications I have had complete relief from depression for 10 years with 15 mg/day Selegiline tablets.  I have not needed to observe diet restrictions, and I also take 50 mg day of DHEA which adds to the anti-depressant effect for me.

One recent problem however, the refill I picked up in August of this year, 2011, pretty definitely has something wrong with is, as the medicine has become less effective for depression, I&#039;ve had a pounding heart and I&#039;ve had noticeable hair thinning problems.  So I&#039;ve stopped for now and with MD&#039;s help am looking for a safe source."
