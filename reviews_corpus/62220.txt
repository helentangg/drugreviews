"I have been taking citalopram for about 4 months now and WOW what a difference it has made! I was starting to get really depressed and I have always struggled with social anxiety and never really knew always thought I was just shy (I was very shy as a child)  I started taking this and within weeks I felt like a different person. I no longer get really nervous when talking to management at work. I let so many people in the past intimidate me. My husband has a lot of friends that I have not really taken the time to get to know just because I felt I was not as good as them and they were always judging me I felt uncomfortable around them. Now I have a great time with them. I wish I would have had this when I was in school would have changed my life!"
