"Prozac was the first antidepressant I was ever put on and it never really helped me. I couldn&#039;t eat normally for several weeks, kept throwing up and while waiting for the side effects to go away my doctor gave me a higher dose and my anxiety seemed to get even worse. About a month in, my suicidal thoughts got worse and I just got reckless with my life because I felt like nothing mattered. After an intervention with my friends I decided to just stop taking it cold turkey, and I really didn&#039;t experience that bad of withdrawal effects, I was just glad I wasn&#039;t taking it anymore. I would say it made me the most suicidal I&#039;d been in a long time and while it may work wonders for some people it just did not work with me."
