"Lexapro saved my life and all of those around me.  I would be proud to be a poster child for this medicine.  Work issues had pushed me to the point of near suicide, crying, not being able to sleep through the night.  Doctor started me out at 5 mg and wanted me to go to 10 mg, but didn&#039;t have to. 5mg did the trick.  At least I know I can up it if I need to, but right now I am doing great!"
