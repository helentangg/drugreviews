"I&#039;ve been on Lexapro for under three weeks now and it&#039;s been pretty great so far. I suffer from severe general and social anxiety and also depression. 
I started on 10mg for the first four days, then upped to 20mg on the fifth day. 

I noticed slight results after day four and to this day the over thinking and gut wrenching anxiety has been lessened. I have no depression anymore and it&#039;s close to impossible to care about stressful situations.

I&#039;m well aware it can take up to two months for Lexapro to fully take effect, however I feel the positive benefits already.
Definitely something worth a try! Especially if you have anxiety and depression that is out of control. 

Besides the side effects, which are slowly fading away, Lexapro is great"
