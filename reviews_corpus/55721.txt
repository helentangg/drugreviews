"I stopped taking this medicine briefly, for around 5 days, due to the &quot;speed effect&quot; and had to go right back on it, due to brain zaps!!  I was (and still am) only taking 75 mg daily (once in the am).  I take 1 mg of Xanax daily, but if I take it AFTER the Effexor, it won&#039;t work. I decided to switch it around and take it BEFORE the antidepressant and it works a LITTLE better, but not much.  I used to take it early in the afternoon and was up all night.  Now as long as I take it before 1 pm, I sleep fine.  I&#039;ve been taking it since January of 2014 and have noticed me being much calmer, still anxious at times, but much better before prescribed to me!  It DOES cause, weight loss, drowsiness and fatigue if I take it while lying down."
