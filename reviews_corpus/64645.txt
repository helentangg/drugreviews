"I&#039;ve been on Zoloft 50 mg once a day for social anxiety disorder/generalized anxiety disorder and it has worked great. After trying several other medications, I&#039;m happy that I&#039;ve found the one for me. It took about two weeks for the effects to become noticeable, and fortunately I have not had any negative side effects. I&#039;ve noticed quite a few changes thanks to Zoloft. For example, I used to hate making phone calls for work and would always feel serious anxiety, now I can do it with no problem. I also find it easier to speak in front of people, and in general my thoughts seem more organized and calmer. I would recommend Zoloft to someone trying an SSRI for the first time, as it is the only one that hasn&#039;t caused me a negative reaction."
