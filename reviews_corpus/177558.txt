"Over a year ago, I was plagued by a 3 month bout of depression along with my daily battles with GAD. By the end of the summer, I finally went to a psychiatrist. At first he put me on Lexapro, which I thought would help because by boyfriend had been taking it. I immediately gained ten pounds in 2 months... With my history of an eating disorder in my childhood, this worsened my anxiety and also the Lexapro wasn&#039;t really working well anyways. I finally switched to Cymbalta. I began with a 30 mg dosage which began to put a smile on my face. Its effect was subtle for about a month so we decided to up the dosage to 60mg. It was night and day. I was finally able to relax and i genuinely felt happy, almost like I could finally smell the roses."
