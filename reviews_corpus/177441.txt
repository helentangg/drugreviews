"Add on to 30mg mirtazapine. Cymbalta taken in morning. 1st day: diarrhea, very stoned feeling all day, slightly more anxious. 2nd day: slightly more depressed and anxious, a little less stoned feeling, slight constipation, sexual dysfunction. 3rd day: extremely depressed...worst I&#039;ve ever felt. Suicidal. 4th day: same extreme and worsening depression. Couldn&#039;t handle it, stopped taking it after 4th day. Worsened depression to the extreme. Don&#039;t know if the side effects would&#039;ve lessened, but couldn&#039;t take the extreme depression. Sexual dysfunction also added to depression."
