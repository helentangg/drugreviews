"I probably was always prone to mild depression and the odd mood, but the strain of looking after my aged and ill father for about 4 years 24/7 took it&#039;s toll.  As my wife said at times it was like treading on eggshells with me.  I was put on 50mg of Sertraline and after a week or two I felt human and happy again.  I came off the tablets last week after about 3 years (had tried after one but it was too soon) and feel fine.  If I suffered any side effects then not sure what as some things could be put down to getting older although not too old, just coming up 59, but feeling tired at times and yawning is about as bad as it got.  Maybe some colic but easily sorted with the very occasional domperidone pill.

Anyway for me Sertraline was good."
