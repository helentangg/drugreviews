"I have been on Pristiq for about 3 weeks steady. I feel so good but my moods have come back. When I get angry I still get the sudden urge to yell, scream at my kids. I have to tell my doctor this.  I have been embarrassed and scared to share it with my doctor but my kids are now 13 and 15 and they are suffering as well, watching me go through these mood swings. I think I need an increase in the dosage. I know I have the minimum dose right now. Overall Pristiq saved me and my children."
