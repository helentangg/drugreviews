"I have taken the Brisdelle for a year and a half.  I LOVE IT!  No side effects but it is pricey.  I went to the Dr and she suggested I change to the 10mg of Paxil as it is a lot ALOT less expensive.   I am going to try it but somewhat nervous about it.  Is there anything I should be aware of or leery of?"
