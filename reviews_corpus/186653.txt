"I had cancer and went through a year of treatments .. the chemo threw me full force into menopause... and just when I thought I was getting back to normal...I had major depression and awful anxiety.  It was very debilitating - I was angry and crying all the time.  I started on 50mg of Pristiq and it helped slightly within a couple of days.. the anger went away, they upped my dose to 100mg and almost 6 weeks to the day...it was like somebody turned the light switch on.  I had no side effects at all and best of all I feel completely normal not drugged or off center...just GREAT!"
