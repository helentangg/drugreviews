"Female, age 55. Chronic dysthymia with episodes of major depression. Have been on Viibryd for about 4 weeks, ramping up from 10 to 40 mg, as I ramped off Zoloft. I also take Wellbutrin, Ativan, and Ritalin (for fatigue).  I have been a Type I diabetic for over 35 years.

I had side effects when I began taking Viibryd.  Nausea (no vomiting), more frequent stools, fatigue and severe cognitive fuzz-out and difficulty with short-term memory.

Anyone else have chills with this med?  About 30 minutes after dosing, I typically get very shivery.  The affect does not last long and is not severe, but it is very weird!

Dr. told me to try taking 1/2 dose of Viibryd at bedtime or with evening meal, but this did not work because it made me wide awake."
