"I&#039;d give it a 6.5. Starting the drug was difficult and I had a lot of side effects. It felt as though the two hemispheres of my brain were splitting apart. I never really felt like my MDD and GAD was better, the drug just made it so I could get through each day without crying constantly and having panic attacks. I had no sex drive. I gained weight but it was my fault mostly due to uncontrolled eating. I looked bloated in the face and look back on pictures and I look like a pudgy baby; on other antidepressants, my face looked slim even at the same weight. I felt numb emotionally, esp. guilt and shame at not being able to cry at Grandad&#039;s funeral and carried this for years. It&#039;s a worth trying but coming off it is bad: vertigo &amp; brain zaps"
