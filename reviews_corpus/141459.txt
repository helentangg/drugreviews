"I had really bad anxiety/depression from switching schools last year. So much anxiety that I couldn&#039;t eat much or would throw up in the morning before school. Lexapro helped me significantly. Really helped calm my thoughts and made me happier. The only downside for me is the drowsiness. I feel super tired after taking it, but I&#039;m going to try taking it at night now verses in the morning."
