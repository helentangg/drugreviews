"I am in my teens and started ZOLOFT when I started getting anxiety when I changed schools. It was getting bad and effecting my quality of life. I started on 25 mg but I was still getting panic attacks so I went up to 50mg with my doctors recommendation. I&rsquo;m on approximately month 2 or 3 and feeling great! I feel euphoric at times and liking life again. It is the perfect drug for me."
