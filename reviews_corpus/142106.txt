"I had severe anxiety disorder. Probably very close to being hospitalized.  My doctor put me on lexapro and yes, it took awhile to reach full effect, but each day got better and better.  Within a month I was feeling more like myself and within two months, I felt that I had my life back. No noticeable side effects for me."
