"Celexa has improved my life considerably. I feel more in control of my emotions on a daily basis. My family doctor started me on it but is now hesitant about dosing. I have an appointment with a psychiatrist to help manage my medications since I have started to have tremors in my eyes, restless legs at night and my husband reports I have seizures in my sleep. I think with a medication like Celexa I would recommend being followed by a specialist who is familiar with dosing, therapeutic response, and side effects."
