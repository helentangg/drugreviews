"I&#039;ve been taking Prozac for about 2 years and it has changed my life. I have a son with a disability so I always worried, felt sad, lost interest in new people...could go on and on...but I&#039;ve been on the minimum dose, 10 mg ?, and it has really helped. I&#039;m so much more easy going and don&#039;t want to hide in a closet and cry when my son is sick. Take as directed and give it at least a month...I wish I had started on this years ago!"
