"I have been taking amitriptyline for the last 4 months, Have suffered daily migraines since being a young teen. I was started on one tablet 10mg at night for a month which gave little change to my migraines, then upped to 20mg before bed a month later to 30mg at night which delayed them starting until about midday each day. My doctor has now started me on 10mg 3 times daily and has so far been life changing I have only had one migraine attack out of each week. Hoping this keeps up."
