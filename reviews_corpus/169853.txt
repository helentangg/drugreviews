"I had a migraine one and half years ago, it last around 9 months, during which I was so sick and went to see the doctor several times. They could not help either, just gave me some painkillers. Fortunately it gradually cured itself, and last 1 year and half has headache free. Recently this ghost come back again. This time my family doctor first prescribed verapamil, which caused dizziness after 3rd day of administration. Then he give me amitriptyline, I took 10 mg of it and next day it&#039;s like a miracle, no headache. 

I am so happy now. "
