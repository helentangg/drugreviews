"I was on Lexapro awhile ago, but stopped taking it.  Then my anxiety and panic attacks started coming back, and the doctor wanted to try me on Zoloft.  I experienced horrible side effects, and it made my anxiety worse.  I said I didn&#039;t want to take a medicine that causes me MORE anxiety!  I asked if I could PLEASE go back on Lexapro, it had a couple of side effects but nothing like Zoloft.  This is my 3rd day on it again, and already I can tell a big difference.  I would rather take medicine to make me feel normal again than try to tell myself I don&#039;t need it.  Because it&#039;s not worth spending life depressed and anxious over everything.  I would definitely recommend trying it, to improve the quality of life for an anxious personality."
