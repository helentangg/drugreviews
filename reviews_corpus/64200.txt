"I had severe OCD, anxiety, major depression and insomnia. I ended up on Quetiapine 200mg to treat the insomnia and anxiety. I was later prescribed Sertraline 50mg and increased to 200mg gradually through 50mg increments every 2 weeks. I noticed a significant improvement after 6 weeks. After the second week of Sertraline 200mg I began to reduce the Quetiapine by 50mg every 2 weeks until stopping. The psychiatrist suggested taking Quetiapine alongside Sertraline would minimise the reported initial increase of symptoms caused by starting Sertraline. This was sound advice as I had no increase in symptoms initially. The main side effects I&#039;ve had are joint pain in my neck, shoulders and knees and increased wind."
