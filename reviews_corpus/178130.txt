"I have been on Cymbalta for 6 years. It was a life saver for me as I was unable to take the SSRIs due to retinal detachment, and the older type of medicines did little for me. During the first 2 weeks of Cymbalta, nausea was the most common side effect but that only lasted for approx 3-4 weeks. This medicine gave me my life back after suffering for years from fear and anxiety. Thanks Eli Lilly."
