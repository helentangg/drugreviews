"Dose: 25 mg&#039;s once daily.
Pro&#039;s: found this great for anxiety/mild-moderate depression. Took in the morning with food. Started to feel better within 48 hours. My brain felt calm &amp; focused. Slept so well at night. 
Con&#039;s: dry mouth,  stomach bloat/continual stomach pain and IBS like symptoms all day long.  I also suffer from GERD/Acid Reflux and already had been taking prescribed PPI stomach pill prior, yet this did not help nor reduce any of gastro side effects of the Sertraline. Unfortunately, this was a deal breaker and I have decided to stop with the med because of ongoing daily stomach/gastro issues. My brain did so well on this med but my stomach did not."
