"I was very sceptical that an anti-depressant would help with my persistent burning mouth syndrome. My symptoms were severe, burning tongue, roof of the mouth, and throat. After many tests and no results, my doctor suggested amitriptyline. It worked almost immediately, and after two weeks, almost all the pain is gone.
The side effects are minimal, dry mouth and disturbed dreams which seem to have diminished after a month or so. It&#039;s worth it for me."
