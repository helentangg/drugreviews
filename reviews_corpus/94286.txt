"I have been on Brintellix for about 3 weeks now. So far I&#039;ve noticed increased energy, weight loss, nausea, headaches, loss of sleep, nightmares, and some aggression.  I have finally found 1 that works and I&#039;m having all these side effects.  I started out on the 10mg and still currently taking the 10mg. Maybe I need to be on a lower dose.  I also take Ambien 10mg for sleep.  "
