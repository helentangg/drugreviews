"After many antidepressant medications over the years, I had resigned myself to a low sex drive and a bit of flatness in effect. But after Viibryd, I regained that sexual spark and the depression lifted. It&#039;s been 4 months now and I&#039;m on 40mg having stayed two weeks at 10, two weeks at 20, then 1 week of 20, alternated with 40 mgs. And then finally one 40mg daily. I have struggled with sluggish bowels for years so this may be why I didn&#039;t have diarrhea. However, there was some gasiness the first month and bowels more loose. No nausea but I do take it with a spoonful of peanut butter. Most days I feel content which for me is exceptional."
