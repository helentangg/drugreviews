"If I didn&#039;t have side effects from Effexor, I would still be on it right now. I&#039;m currently in the stages of slowly tapering off of it, with instruction from my doctor. I went from 75mg to 150mg. Now, I am taking a 75 37.5 for a week, tapering it off every week from there. 

You need to be extremely disciplined about taking this medicine every day, and at the same time every day. With my schedule, I was never able to take it at the same time every day. I would get what are called &quot;brain zaps,&quot; which is the feeling like everything rushed to your head for a split second. I also had sexual side effects on Effexor, though it was more noticeable on lower doses. I&#039;ve been on Zoloft, Luvox, Prozac and Effexor. On to Cymbalta now."
