"I have been taking Lexapro for over a year and had no problems. I got switched to the generic on 3/28 and on 3/30 I was at the Dr. office because my throat was swollen. Sunday I was in the hospital with an allergic reaction to the generic escitalopram. I had hives and my face and hands were swollen three times the size they were supposed to be. I wish it would have worked for me. If anything swells up stop taking and go to your primary care physician immediately. "
