"Works wonders for my anxiety and panic attacks, and even depression. But it puts me in a manic / euphoric / agitated condition. Sometimes unbearable. So I have to take Klonopin 2-4mg a day alongside olanzapine 5mg when things get out of control. Side effects for me: hunger, excessive yawning, euphoria/mania, weight gain, lower sex drive, very vivid dreams, they mostly go away within 10-14 days. The withdrawals are lengthy and hard so be careful, go slow. Works for me, meds turned my life around once again."
