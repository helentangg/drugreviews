"I started on a very low dose, like 2.5 or 5 mg, then 10mg, then 25 and now I&#039;m on 50. I started seeing a definite decrease in my migraines at 25mg so my doctor doubled my dose, but nothing new after 3 weeks at 50mg. It&#039;s nice that this is an anti-depressant too, I feel happier since I&#039;ve been on it. Haven&#039;t noticed any weight gain and I hope I don&#039;t ever. Anyway it seems to just block my usual triggers, they just don&#039;t bother me as much as they used to. I still get migraines once or twice a week, worse with heavy stress, but I have been amazed at how I can go out into the sunlight or exercise without immediately getting a migraine. Amazing."
