"Tried Cymbalta for pain and slight depression.  It helped for maybe 10 months.  Then began experiencing panic attacks, anxiety, mouth sores, racing heart at bedtime, insomnia, and increased pain and cramps in legs.  Took me about 3 months to figure out that the Cymbalta wasn&#039;t working.  I tried increasing from 30 mg to 60 mg and that made it worse.  Have changed meds.  Made the change easily in one week, but I had already gone back to the 30 mg dose.  The anxiety, panic attacks, etc. have stopped."
