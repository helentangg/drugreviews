"This is awful! It caused Psoriasis and severe Panic attacks. If you are feeling stressed and anxious... this gave me SEVERE Psoriasis which caused me to be misdiagnosed by TWO doctors. This medication will also turn you into a defunct sexless zombie. This isn&#039;t a life saver at all. And if you choose to one day come off this medication... it will take MONTHS to get rid of the withdrawals. It doesn&#039;t matter if you quit cold turkey or taper down. You will throw up, you will become severely nauseated, diarrhea like you wouldn&#039;t believe, hot flashes, &amp; brain zaps from Hell. Be careful with any medication especially one that alters your brain!"
