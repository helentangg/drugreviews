"So far have been on Lexapro for 4 weeks (not counting the first week of weaning off Remeron and onto Lexapro).  Generally, I think I feel better as a whole, but know I have to give it more time.  Unfortunately, this has NOT helped the anxiety I experience every single morning which makes me cry, and have actually had to take more Ativan than prescribed to stop the trembling inside.  Will be talking to my doctor soon because something&#039;s got to give.  I don&#039;t want to try anything else after 4 weeks and go through new side-effects, and most of the comments on here are very favorable if you stick it out.  Guess I&#039;m going to try to stick it out for another couple weeks.  I wish people could comment on these comments instead of in the Questions and Answers forum."
