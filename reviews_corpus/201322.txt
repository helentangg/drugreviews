"Hello everyone!! I had been suffering from  chest pain for about 3 years. I had all kinds of tests done and they all have come out normal. This chest pain was interfering with my everyday life. I started avoiding many things that I thought would contribute to my chest pain all with no success. My doctor then said that it was anxiety. He prescribed zoloft and I was really hesitant to take it. I have never been on an antidepressant and I was afraid. Well today is my 6th day on it and I already feel an improvement. I haven&#039;t had any side effects well only the 1st night I couldn&#039;t sleep but all is well now. I don&#039;t want to be on this for ever. I am planning on taking it for 6 months. I highly recommend  Zoloft. I am on 50mg daily."
