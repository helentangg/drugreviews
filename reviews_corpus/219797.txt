"Today I am on 100mg of Elavil and it is working quite well.  Best of all, Elavil has the added bonus of curbing my neuropathy which had forced me to be on fentanyl for over 4 years.  Been about eight years now and it is still doing a great job.  I have been on just about every drug they have for panic and other than Prozac this is one of the only drugs that has worked or worked without nasty side effects.  paxil worked but TOTALLY wiped out my sex drive and ability to perform.  Zoloft did nothing at all good or bad.  Alcohol was good at knocking down the panic attacks but the bad there was the attacks became more frequent.  Imipramine only masked the symptoms causing some nasty muscle tension that lead to migraines."
