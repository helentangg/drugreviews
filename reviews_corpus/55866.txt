"I had a surgery on my neck to remove a tumor. It caused nerve damage that was life altering. I dealt with it for a full year prior to a doctor prescribing Effexor. I got my life back. The pain is an annoyance now but much, much better. Taking 37.5 in morning and again at night. Started helping in about a week. Some sexual side effects but other than that I have my old life back. Also feel happier which I guess is a positive side effect."
