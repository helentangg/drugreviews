"I started this medication six months ago 10 mg. My anxiety improved quickly and the side effects as well. sadness, stomach burning, nausea,burping, stomach pain etc. I cut it to 5 mg but  still experiencing bad side effects. I tried to quit and after 10 days my anxiety came back with vengeance and I was forced to go back to 5 mg. My doctor says that it is up to me. Now I&#039;m stuck and more confused. If I take it then my side effects bother me a lot and if I quit then my anxiety kills me."
