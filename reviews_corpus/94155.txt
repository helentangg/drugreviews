"Started taking Brintellix 13 days ago and noticed an immediate difference. It helped with my GAD and depression. I had slight nausea after taking it on an empty stomach so ate a bite of something before taking it until my body got used to it. I&#039;ve tried EVERYTHING and this is the only medication that did not cause severe side effects. Very happy and the results are incredible. I can smile again! ☺️"
