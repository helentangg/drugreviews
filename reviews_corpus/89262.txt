"My daughter took this drug.  Side effects, experiencing past two days and I don&#039;t know how many more days:  Continual boxing w/ arms, can&#039;t sit still, can not sleep, races around her room. she describes her condition right now as horrific, can not take this any longer.  I am very concerned about her, she lives 5 states away from me.    I would not recommend this drug for anyone.  Doctor described her condition as Akathesia.   Horrible!!"
