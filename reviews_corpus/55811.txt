"I took this for a few years in my late teens for severe depression and self harm tendencies.  It worked well for me.  The only downfall is the effects one experiences if one forgets a dose or stops taking the medicine without approval from one&#039;s medical provider. 

  In my opinion the honest truth is this:  it can be a wonderful, miracle for severe depression and anxiety.  It can make a person more outgoing in their environment and provide someone with more energy.  

The only downfall I ever experienced with it was the withdrawal effects if I forgot a dose.  Brain zaps, nausea, general ill feeling.  If one takes it as directed, however, they shouldn&#039;t experience these.

Never quit this medicine on your own without talking to your doctor."
