"I have been on Viibryd for 10 days. The first 5 or 6 days I had a ton of energy. My stomach was a little bloated but no other major side effects.  About 3 days ago I started feeling very blah, having anxiety, very gassy and just not feeling right.  I am only on 10mg so hopeful that raising me to 20 will solve these problems. After 5  years on Lexapro I wanted to try something that didn&#039;t cause weight gain and didn&#039;t have sexual side effects. I was still having panic attacks and lots of anxiety on the Lexapro so I was hoping this would help.  Just want to feel normal again."
