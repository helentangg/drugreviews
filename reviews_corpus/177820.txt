"I have almost all the listed conditions treated by this medicine, as well as depression from all the pain. Cymbalta is the first medicine I have used in over 15 years that actually works for all of them. I started at 20 Mg and worked up to 60 MG after 3 months. At one time I was asked to take one 60mg every 12 hours to see if it would relieve more pain. I did not notice a difference other than urine retention at this dosage so went back to 60 mg once a day. The symptoms it has helped with are : Overall joint pain, relief from 5 trigger fingers, reduced crawling ant, burning and sunburn feel from my arms and legs, and has lowered the intense pain I have in my lumbar region and reduced my Sciatica pain. I consider it a miracle!"
