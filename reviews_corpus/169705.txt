"This made me so tired that I had to stop taking it.  I felt drugged 20 minutes after taking it (I took it at night) and then I was groggy the entire next day.  Plus, the first night that I took it I woke up with a migraine that wouldn&#039;t go away after my Imitrex Statdose injection.  So now my doctor put me on a beta blocker.  It makes me a little dizzy but I can actually function!!  Guess it works for some people but I couldn&#039;t drive and there&#039;s no way I could go to work on this..."
