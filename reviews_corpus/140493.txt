"I rarely--if ever?!--review medications or pharmaceuticals. Spurred on by a comment regarding &quot;those who take antidepressants,&quot; I&#039;ve started speaking out on not only my depression and anxiety, but also on the benefits of physician-prescribed medications for the same. (Just like we would treat diabetes and HBP, we can and should feel comfortable seeking treatment for anxiety and depression.)

So, about Lexapro: I&#039;m on 5 mg now, have taken 10 mg in the past. Five mg is just about the right dose for me, and YES it does work at that low of a dose. I have not experienced weight gain, nor lethargy, and I have gained what can only be described as peace of mind. I feel like there was a micro-chip missing, and, now, that my brain is whole."
