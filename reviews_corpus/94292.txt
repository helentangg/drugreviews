"I&#039;ve been taking 10mg for 4 days now (today will be day 5) and I&#039;m wondering if I can make it a full week like my doctor wants me to. The side effects have been horrible for me. I&#039;ve been walking around like a nauseous zombie since day 1. Then there&#039;s the dizziness and headache that goes along with it. The only benefit I&#039;ve experienced so far is weight loss, but that&#039;s not at all why I started taking this medication. Instead of the anxiety and depression I would normally feel, I feel no emotions. "
