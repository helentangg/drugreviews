"I have been using Silenor for the past two to three weeks. I haven&#039;t noticed any increase in the amount I have been sleeping, at all. As with most patients, my problem is not with falling asleep, but rather with staying asleep (sleep maintenance).  I still seem to wake up every hour after 1 a.m. However, for some reason during the night, since I have started taking the Silenor, I am less anxious than I had been about the lack of sleep, so maybe that&#039;s something."
