"Ok so a bit of backstory. I have had anxiety and depression since I was 7 due in part to abuse. I was not diagnosed until a couple months ago. About 3 weeks ago I finally admitted I needed more then therapy to get thru this and went to my doctor and was given lexapro 10mg. I feel a little better, but I still feel anxious and depressed almost constantly, the only real change I have noticed is that when I get an attack it feels less frantic and I am able to just wait till the horrible feeling dies down. I also have not been sleeping well. I can&#039;t sleep at night sometimes it&#039;s the anxiety sometimes I just can&#039;t feel tired. I get 2-3 hours once the sun comes up but no matter how tired I am all day I can&#039;t sleep at night. Appointment next week."
