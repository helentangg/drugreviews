"I was on Zoloft for 8 years.  Most of those on a minimum maintenance dose.  In the last few years it affected my memory and it didn&#039;t work as well for the depression and anxiety.  Does a good job treating PMS.  I had to go off eventually, but it was a good run.  Had night sweats and some sexual side effects.  I also would feel nauseous if I was hungry while I was on it.  Best to take at night."
