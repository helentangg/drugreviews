"So, a little over a year ago (20 year old female) I was diagnosed with depression. My doctor gave me Celexa 20 mg. The first week I had dry mouth and nausea, but that was about it for side effects, they went away quickly. Celexa made me feel more in control of my emotions, happier, and less tearful. After 8 months, I switched to 40 mg, it didn&#039;t do very much and 4 months later, I had gained 15 lbs. So I switched back to 20 mg. It has been over a year now and I feel like the medication has stopped working, I&#039;m feeling depressed again, sleeping a lot, more sadness. So I&#039;m going to see my doctor and switch. Overall, for a first medication, it was good. Just definitely watch your weight and what you&#039;re eating!"
