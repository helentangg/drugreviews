"Before I started taking Effexor I would get severely depressed, anxious and my brain wouldn&#039;t stop. I have been on Effexor now for 4 weeks and I feel good.I don&#039;t feel so anxious or down on myself. Even people around me have commented and they don&#039;t know I am taking pills. The side effects I do feel are as follows: Nausea (went away after 2 weeks), loss of appetite, no sexual desire, and blurred vision. Sounds like a lot..but I&#039;d rather deal with these issues then on a constant downward spiral."
