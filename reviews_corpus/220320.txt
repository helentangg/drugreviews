"I was put on Amitriptyline to aid in sleep while on Prozac.  When I discontinued the Prozac and the amitriptyline because I no longer needed an antidepressant, I noticed an old problem with hyperhidrosis reappeared.  I went back on just 5mg of the amitriptyline and the results were amazing.  No more sweating and feeling very calm all day long."
