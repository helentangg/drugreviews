"I&#039;ve used Viibryd for a couple of years. 40 mg grew to being jittery, even with exercise. At 20 mg I have improvement. I&#039;m much more functional. Being lactose intolerant, it&#039;s not uncommon to have diarrhea from time to time. If early in the day, it seems to cause a drop in energy, focus, etc. As needed, I sometimes take an additional 10 mg at lunch.

Previous medicines tried were Prozac and Cymbalta."
