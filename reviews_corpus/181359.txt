"I just started Prozac again after being off it for several years.  After going off Prozac the first time, I tried battling depression with alternative methods, including yoga, exercise and CBT.  Recently I decided I was losing the battle using these methods alone and went back to Prozac.  My experience so far is that the medication is working. I have so far not been experiencing the really deep lows while on this medication.  I do feel a bit drowsier that usual, although this is not entirely unwelcome as I was having trouble sleeping before and now I find I am able to sleep and nap more easily.  Exercise and avoiding alcohol dramatically helps with the drowsiness issue and also helps improve mood further in combination with the Prozac."
