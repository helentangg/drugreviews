"I&#039;ve been on 10mg Celexa for over 11 weeks. Started on 10 mg for a week  then 20 mg for a week. Side effects on 20 mg: headaches, confusion, constipation. Now on 10 mg for the balance of Celexa experience. I weigh 162 (lost 5 lbs.) and am 71 yrs.
I stopped alcohol (2-3 oz. per night 7 days a week); which may have caused some side effects with the 20 mg and not the cause of Celexa. I still have some headaches, constipation and that&#039;s it on side effects.
My depression (clinically defined as down, sleep 10  hrs., not much interest in Life, more) has lifted. I may continue to use Celexa and no alcohol for Life, as I have been depressed numerous times. I was primary health caretaker for my chronically ill wife for 11 yrs. She died 12-10-10."
