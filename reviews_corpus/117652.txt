"I&#039;m a 47yo male who has suffered from migraines for about 30years. They have increased in frequency and duration over the last 2years to the point where I sought preventive therapy.  I tried propanolol, various muscle relaxers and most recently nortriptyline. I started with 10mg taken at bedtime with little relief. Eventually, increased dose to 75mg and am happy to report migraines have decreased from 2-3 week to 2/mo. Still have to stay away from triggers such as alcohol and chocolate. Only side effect seems to be short term memory loss."
