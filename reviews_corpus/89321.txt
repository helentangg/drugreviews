"I have only been taking Celexa 20mg for about a week.  My only complaint is that it makes me EXTREMELY drowsy like a Zombie and slight stomach cramps so I started taking it at night and I am considering cutting the tablet in half.  However, I have had depression for most of my adult life and like others I was against medication but I could not take it any longer.  I do feel a slight improvement I am not numb anymore but I think I need to give it more time to get the full effect."
