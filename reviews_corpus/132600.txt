"I was on zopiclone for about 14 years and was successful in weening myself off but having difficulty sleeping again. Doctor prescribed Silenor 3mg and with directions &quot;take 1 or 2 tablets as needed&quot;. I&#039;ve opted to take 1/2 tablet (1.5 mg) to start. I&#039;ve been sleeping and feeling rested on awakening. Not sure if it&#039;s psychological or not."
