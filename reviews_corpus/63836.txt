"If your scared to try something new I completely understand! I was really nervous about trying Zoloft, but I have to say I&#039;m happy I did! I&#039;ve only been taking it for a week for my anxiety disorder, stress, ptsd and depression. It has helped me feel more balanced and I&#039;m a lot more calm. I&#039;m happier and I can tell it helps me not have so many negative thoughts that bring on my anxiety about things. I can tell it&#039;s helping become a better mom and wife already. I hope it continues to work for me, because I was under a lot of stress and always worrying about stuff and I couldn&#039;t take the way I felt anymore. I had nausea and dizziness like the first 2 days, but then it went away. Stick with it if you want to see a difference! :)"
