"I was prescribed Cymbalta for fibromyalgia.  Not only did it not work for the fibromyalgia, but it restarted the hot flashes that had been under control!  In doing research on fibromyalgia, I discovered that this drug has been reported to worsen hot flashes and other menopausal symptoms in women with fibromyalgia.  If it works for you, many blessings!"
