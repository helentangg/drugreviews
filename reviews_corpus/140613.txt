"Dealing with Anxiety for almost 20 years. Tried many different medication and methods. Started escitalopram 10 mg/ day early Nov2016 ( almost 3 month ago) with the help of Lorazepam for first few weeks. 
It is working very well. 
First week a little headache and some ongoing yawning came with it but not a big deal.
Anxiety is significantly better and my sleep has improved . My mind is not generating negative thoughts and over analyzing them anymore .
I am able to look at the whole picture on the issues as oppose to worrying about details that were not important to begin with before taking this med.
My family notices my improvement and my better mood.
I wish I started this years ago and enjoyed my youth . Ah."
