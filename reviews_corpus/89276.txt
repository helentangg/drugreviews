"I started taking Celexa for anxiety and bad stress. My BP was rising very high and couldn&#039;t sleep much. I&#039;m now only on my 7 dose of 10 mg and I feel tired but I&#039;m giving this new med time to work. It took me 6 months to safely get off of xanax my doc put me on after a injury in which caused much stress. My BP is now back to normal and I feel good a little tired but unlike other reviews I&#039;ve read I don&#039;t eat as much and now am losing wt. But yes I also &quot;hopefully just for now&quot; have lost some interest in sex and I&#039;m a male and its harder to climax. Think it will all get better but so far this is a good med for me."
