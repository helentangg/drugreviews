"On Day 1.  Felt a little out of it but some how relaxed.  I&#039;ve yawned most of the day and woke up promptly after 8 hours of sleep.  Glad I will be able to make it to work on time.  A little ringing in the ears.  Otherwise so far so good.  I&#039;ve been afraid of SSRIs for sometime now.  Had a manic spell with Effexor (SNRI) a few years back.  Doc ramped me up on Lamictal first just in case.  Doxepin to sleep as needed."
