"I was very reluctant to go on medication but my anxiety that was overwhelming increased to such an extent I was very unmotivated professionally and personally. For the first 3 days I felt very nauseous and had little appetite which was great as it stopped that overeating I had. I lost 2kgs within the first few days and then suddenly the nausea was gone, my head was very clear, I have been able to concentrate again and am genuinely surprised at its effect only a week and a half in."
