"So far this medicine has been working great for me.  Not only for my mild depression but also for my joint pain.  I was not aware it was used for this however, told my physician that I was experiencing less joint and muscle pain.  This is when he informed me Cymbalta was also used for pain.  I cannot afford $50.00 a month.  I will have to go back to my other medicine, which is less effective for joint pain but the same for depression."
