"I suffer from PTSD and the associated issues Anxiety and depression that is part of the package. Started a generic brand, This is the 3rd drug I have been on previously was on Lexapro, worked but caused a very emotionless state after 2 years.Then Valdoxan worked slowly, great for sleep,  then eventually levelled off after 2 years. 
As for Cymbalta, the first 5 days wasn&#039;t fun, tired, anxious, negative thoughts, very spaced out couldn&#039;t drive, and Nausea. Then just as fast as the side effects came on they went over 48 hrs. Now just a week in feel better, more positive very little side effects slight nausea that is improving every day.
I&#039;m confident that the drug will work and find myself looking forward to the future."
