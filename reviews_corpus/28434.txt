"Lexapro is extremely helpful in reducing my generalized anxiety disorder. I need to take a Xanax very very rarely in case of panic attack or severe anxiety that the Lexapro doesn&#039;t cut it but 98% of the time Lexapro knocks out my feelings of rumination from generalized anxiety, panic and fear."
