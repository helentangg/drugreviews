"Starting this medication was the best thing I could have done for myself. I struggle with anxiety and depression, and I also have premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Sertraline has helped me cope with all of them. I haven&#039;t been this mentally stable and clear-headed for a very long time - maybe never. I can make decisions without agonizing over them, experience new social situations, do new things, and life seems so much more managable. All of the hurdles in my life that seemed insurmountable before are now obstacles I know I can climb over. The only side-effect I&#039;ve noticed is a little bit of dry mouth, and I started to noticably feel the affects only about a week or so taking it."
