"My initial experience  with Brintellix is very promising. I&#039;ve suffered from treatment resistive depression and Generalized anxiety disorder for many years. Name it, I&#039;ve been on it. Many medicines flatlined me emotionally, other&#039;s amped anxiety and left me sleepless, others were weight sensitive, causing rapid weight gain (hello Remeron); others worked like a charm - until they stopped working. It&#039;s been a 25 year struggle. My new Doc put me on Brintellix and within short days I felt more alert and &#039;content&#039; with no sleeping problems. No side effects on entry dose of 5 mg. I take 2.5 mg Klonopin when required if I have an anxiety peak - other than that I feel like the &quot;Me&quot; I knew was in there."
