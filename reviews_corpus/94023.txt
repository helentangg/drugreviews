"I started taking it 8 days ago.. I started to feel a little better each day. I did have nausea the first day. i noticed that when i get excited or run around too fast working, i get a little nausea..but not too bad and it passes when I calm myself. I&#039;m very happy with the way it&#039;s working. oh, and taking 10mg."
