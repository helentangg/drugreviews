"This is just my second day of amitript. and I feel so doped and drugged out...Dr gave it to me for severe anxiety (GAD) which I have suffered for years...I could never tolerate the SSRI&#039;s and so she is now trying the amtrip...I feel so out of it and depressed...cant hardly move off the couch much less do any things around the house...I know this is a sedating antidepressant and its the older ones but at such a small dose will I ever get use to the sedating effects and will it really help with the anxiety I have...I dont want to feel like this if its not going to ever help and alll I feel is drugged out every day...I am taking it 3 hours before bedtime and sleeping til 10am the next morning ..should I change meds or give it a go...thanks guys.x"
