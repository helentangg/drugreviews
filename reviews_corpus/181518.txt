"Prozac saved my life! 20 mg. I&#039;m on week three. I was out of work for months and couldn&#039;t think clear. Then on the third week I woke up, finally got out of my bed and pursued looking for work. Got hired that same day! Yay! I encourage you to stay on Prozac for three weeks to take effect."
