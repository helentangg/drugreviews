"I suffered from depression and generalized anxiety disorder for 4 years and 10 mg of Lexapro worked miracles.  Side effects lasted about  month and included fuzziness, fatigue and brain zaps.  I weaned myself off 6 months ago and should NOT have done that. Fell into major depression and horrible anxiety including panic attacks.  Really bottomed out finally with a twitching emotional collapse curled up in bed.  Forced myself to Dr. who put me back on 10 mg 3 weeks ago.  First week side effects horrible, including nausea, cramps, brain zaps, tremors and nightmares.  Now, into 4th week, depression is gone, anxiety much relieved and able to function.  I know in another couple of weeks, I will be back to normal again.  "
