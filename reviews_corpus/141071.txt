"I was on this medication last year after I overcame an eating disorder and it worked perfectly fine. my doctor told me everything was okay and took me off it, worst mistake ever. Now I&#039;ve been on it again for 8 weeks and still feel blah with headaches and weird dreams; pretty much not feeling like me. It worked for me the first time taking this medicine; I would advise not to come off it if it if working."
