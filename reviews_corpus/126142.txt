"I started taking Viibryd approximately three months ago. It started out rough, lots of side effects, terrible nightmares every night, electric shocks, visual disturbances, nausea and diarrhea, among others.  I continued with the medicine because I have been on well over 15-20 others over the years.  To my surprise after the symptoms alleviated I felt much better, a lot less depressed and generally less hopeless. This lasted only about a month and a half, my body has become tolerant to the medication like every other and now I am in a deeper depression than usual, so I am going back to Wellbutrin."
