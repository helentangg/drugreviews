"One day out of the blue I started experiencing extreme anxiety and panic attacks.  I would wake up in the middle of the night shaking and sweating. I couldn&#039;t eat, sleep, or socialize with my friends. I was scared at first but finally decided to try celexa. Initially the side effect sucked. Insomnia, increased anxiety, and a weird fuzzy head feeling.  I switched to taking it in the morning and that helped with the insomnia. I also slowly titrated by 5mg up to my recommend dose which lessened the side effects. All in all, I&#039;m very happy with the results. I rarely get anxious anymore. For those of you just getting on to it, give it time."
