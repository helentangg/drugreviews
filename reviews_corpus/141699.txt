"I&#039;ve had depression for years (runs in family). I was on Prozac (didn&#039;t do much) then switched to Zoloft. After a while on Zoloft I noticed that I felt like a zombie, almost devoid of emotion but prone to rage at times. I switched to Lexapro and it was as if a light had been turned on. Wow! I had energy and positive thoughts again plus MOTIVATION, which had been completely lacking on Zoloft and Prozac. I did have headaches but started taking the pill at night which worked. I would stay on Lexapro and give it a 10 rating, however lately I&#039;ve felt quite jumpy and nervous. Sometimes I feel a little anxious but not bad. I&#039;m going to now try Celexa, which is supposed to be much like Lexapro but with less anxiety."
