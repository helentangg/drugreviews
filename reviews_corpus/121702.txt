"Been on 150mg of Venlafaxine for 12 years upped a year ago to 225mg and havent noticed a difference.
my daughter knows when i haven&#039;t taken it though....i either go manic or very low. I still have more lows than highs.
I am 51 years old now and was first put on Valium at 2.5 years old.
I was told years ago it was Clinical Depression with Manic Tendencies...my eldest brother had the same (other 2 brothers...no mental illness) as me....he committed Suicide a number of years ago."
