"Well I was gonna write a lot but apparently there&#039;s a character limit. So I guess we get the short version.  Was on Paxil, after a while on it it made me have extreme outbursts of anger, constant depression, etc.  Psychiatrist switched me to sertraline (started at 50mg, by end of 2 weeks I&#039;m at 200mg). It&#039;s so wonderful.  Reminds me of when you have a procedure, that first oxygen stuff. They give you that just takes the edge off everything.  First couple days had nausea and diarrhea.  Was worried this would last but didn&#039;t.  Longest side effect has been headaches, which are easily handled with ibuprofen.  The goods easily outweigh the bads, and this medicine has helped me in more ways than I can explain."
