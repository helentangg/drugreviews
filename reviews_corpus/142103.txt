"I started taking this 2 years ago and was then taken off it by another doctor as my symptoms had cleared up. All my anxiety/depression symptoms started coming back gradually and I was put on various other drugs like Lyrica, Cymbalta, Lustral, etc and none of them worked and the side effects with some of them were cruel. I am now back on Lexapro, starting at 5mg and increasing by 5mg every week till I reach 20mg. This was the only drug that cured me before, I found it wonderful first time round so fingers crossed it will work again. The side effects starting off are not to bad. I know last time round I didn&#039;t gain weight so I hope I don&#039;t this time either. It&#039;s so good."
