"Have gone off and on this medicine a couple times, 50 mg for anxiety, especially social anxiety. Am just starting to go back on it for the third time because it&rsquo;s been a month since I was off it and I&rsquo;m back to having panic attacks. Only went off it to lose weight (it definitely makes me gain weight) but it is worth it to be on it for the peace of mind that I feel when I&rsquo;m on it. I know a lot of people worry about losing or changing their personality when they go on medicine - but it makes me feel like &ldquo;myself&rdquo; only better. Everyone&rsquo;s different but this could really help and work for you too."
