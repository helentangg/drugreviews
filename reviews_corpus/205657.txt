"I started 50mg of Pristiq only two days ago. My doctor didn&#039;t like the medicine combination that I was on before and they seemed to not be working so well anymore. I was taking Cymbalta and Celexa. I stopped taking Cymbalta and took Pristiq and the Celexa the first day. I was very afraid of a horrid drop in my mood all day being without my Cymbalta. But my mood was great. I stopped taking the Celexa and only took the Pristiq. It&#039;s crazy I feel good. Well aside from the dizzy dumb head feeling. I also get headaches here and there but nothing too terrible. In the past I have tried Effexor XR, Prozac, Lexapro and Zoloft for my depression anxiety. I am really impressed with Pristiq."
