"I have never taken any sort of prescription medicine for any type of mental issues in my life. And to be honest, I was scared to take this. I recently found myself going through a life changing experience and was finding myself unable to function at even the most basic level. I was crying all day, every day and was worthless at home and work. It%u2019s now been two weeks since I started taking Pristiq and I find it a God send. I wonder if I could have used something like this in the past.
I find myself much more even keeled. I don%u2019t lose my temper and seem to be a mellower, happier person and in much less of a hurry. I have only cried once since starting my regimen and that was during a very intense moment.
I%u2019ve been a better father and husband and I really like this."
