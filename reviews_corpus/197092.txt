"I have been very unsure and reluctantly gave in to trying paroxetine as a first anti-depressant I&#039;ve ever tried. Before I took them my moderate depression (triggered by several major life changes with a huge amount of stress) quickly developed into more severe depression and anxiety.  I thought honestly &#039;anything has to be better than how I&#039;m feeling&#039;. And after months of the box of paroxetine sitting in my drawer which was prescribed by my doctor, I knew I had to try.  And I am happy to share that my anxiety was reduced 90% from the second day.  What a surprise and a huge relief.  The depression symptoms are lifting after only one week.  So I am highly praising this medication.  I feel the benefits I&#039;ve so far experienced far outweigh the mild side effects."
