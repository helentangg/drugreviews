"I have been taking 100mg every morning for 9 months,with Trileptal 450mg at night and Adderal in am and after lunch. I was so scattered and depressed last January 09 due to a lot of life changes but really all my life I have sabotaged myself living without treatment. These medicines saved my life and I will continue on them as long as they work. Pritiq is good for me. I mistakenly got my dose mixed up when I first started Pristiq and took 200mg. Never felt better but soon found out that it was dangerous and max is 100mg. Whew...must be careful. Life is good today and it can be for you too. I also use the Pristiq discount card and pay half price...really helps."
