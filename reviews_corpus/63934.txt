"I have anxiety disorders and depression and have been suffering with it for years. When I first started taking this at 25mg the first week I felt sick but that subsided as my body go used to it. Then it was upped to 50 mg and it helped me function better but it changed the way I dream. Doctor still wanted more results so I went up to 100 mg. Ever since then my anxiety and depression have worsened dramatically and it&#039;s like going back to a really bad day with no meds, but every day. I&#039;m most likely going to be taken off of these.
TLDR: this med helped me at a certain dosage but at a higher one caused more anxiety and depression. This could definitely work for someone if they found the right dosage"
