"My Psychiatrist put me in 50mg Pristiq for compulsive, regular binge eating and anxiety/depression.  The first week I was on it, my anxiety-ridden thoughts about food changed completely and I lost interest in binge eating, so I have lost a few pounds so far.  I was extremely happy, with virtually no anxiety.  I am now on week 2, and the anxiety is starting to creep back in and I&#039;m not quite as happy, so I will be discussing increasing my dosage with my doctor.  The loss of interest in food has persisted.  Overall, I think this medication is great and I plan to stay on it."
