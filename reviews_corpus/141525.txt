"After transitioning into university I had a really horrible time with anxiety. I started to feel down all the time and couldn&#039;t stand it. First I was given 10mgs and I worked well for the first two weeks, then I just felt worse. Been on 20mg and that is the perfect dose for me. I feel normal again, it&#039;s great to feel the way I used too."
