"I started on lexapro about week and a half ago 10mg. I had anxiety and panic attacks so bad due to my job I couldn&#039;t even leave the house gripped in fear that I&#039;ll have another attack. I basically felt like my life as I knew it was coming to an end. My family was looking at me weird, close friends too. When I started this drug it increased my anxiety and I felt like I had the flu without the fever. The first 3 days were very hard to say the least, every side effect I felt. Then after about the 4th day I started to feel good. 7 days later I&#039;m back to being me with no attacks, mild anxiety maybe twice every 10 hrs or so... So, I&#039;m telling you to stick with it. You&#039;ll come out on the other end of things and start to feel some normalcy."
