"I&#039;ve been taking fluoxetine for about 6 months now. I was going through really bad depression/anxiety. I tried Celexa and 1 other antidepressant(can&#039;t remember the name) but they made my depression worse. I was scared to try another one but I did anyways, and I&#039;m happy I did. I can eat again, sleep again, function again. It&#039;s not a cure, no antidepressant or anti-anxiety medicine is, but it helps to make it through the day. The real work is all on you. Positive attitude, balanced diet, exercise, and enough sleep. This medicine may work for some, but everybody is different. Pretty much trial and error."
