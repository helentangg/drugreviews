"I used to take quetiapine to fall asleep at night, but when I started to take nortriptyline I had to stop using it because these two meds interact. the doctors told me that nortriptyline would help me sleep at night, too. it doesn&#039;t.  i have to wake up at 7 every morning for work, and I honestly can&#039;t remember the last time I fell asleep before 0200 in the morning. the side effects of this medication are way more intense than any other meds I&#039;ve tried. it does help a litte bit with anxiety, but my depression hasn&#039;t improved."
