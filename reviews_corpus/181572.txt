"I took this for anxiety panic attacks and depression from 2002 to 2003. It helped me tremendously. I literally felt it &quot;kick in&quot; after about 8 or 9 days of taking it. I was VERY skeptical of all medicines ang almost didn&#039;t take it. But thank goodness I did! It made me feel like everything was &quot;smooth sailing&quot;. I Gradually weened myself off it because I could not afford the doctor appointments required as part of my treatment plan. IT was like returning from an exciting vacation when I stopped the Prozac. But I am now strongly considering it again due to tremendous stress in my life, I have become practically a recluse. Anyway, it worked for me!"
