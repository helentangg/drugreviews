"I have calf pain (mainly when sitting) due to small fiber neuropathy. I tried Neurontin, Lyrica, Cymbalta...without any luck. Tramadol provided limited relief, but not nearly enough. Finally I tried Pamelor and after a few weeks the calf pain started to dissipate. I take 100mg/day and the side effects have been pretty mild. The drowsiness tapered off after a few days, but the dry mouth and constipation go with the territory. I get occasional tinnitus as well."
