"This drug didn&#039;t do anything for the first 3 weeks (as expected), but once it started working I felt like a new person. After only a few weeks these effects went away and my life started to feel extremely blend. I figured I would rather experience ups and downs than a blend feeling all the time and stopped the drug with no trouble after 2.5 months."
