"I&#039;ve been taking Zoloft since June of 2010. I was really struggling with anxiety and a little depression. I got anxiety so bad that I did NOT leave my house from March until June. I couldn&#039;t even go outside with having a anxiety attack, then I tried Zoloft (I&#039;ve had the pills since February but didn&#039;t want to use them. I wanted to try and get over it by myself) and taking the pills was the best choice! I&#039;ve only had 1 attack since I started taking them and I even feel better with myself. The only side effects I&#039;ve felt is I can&#039;t sleep when I want too, but remember we are all different and just trying it won&#039;t hurt. But I definitely recommend Zoloft for anxiety and panic attacks!"
