"After 20 years of marriage, I have found myself in the midst of a terrible divorce. I spiraled downward quickly and scarily into a deep, dark depression. I have no history of depression or having to take any anti-depressant type medicines. I was at a point where I was almost unable to function and was suicidal. I realized how severe a crisis I was in and started researching for FAST help. I found Pristiq. I have always been a skeptic, to say the least re: antidepressants, but I must admit, this medicine absolutely saved my life. The only minor side effects were feelings of &quot;zoning out&quot; and a headache for about 3 days on 2nd week. NOTHING SINCE. I&#039;ll take that over my inability to function ANY DAY. "
