"What can I say about this drug, I&#039;ve been off it a year and still don&#039;t feel right. When I was on it it did not feel it helped with my depression. but My main problems started when trying to stop taking this drug, it made me hallucinate, I thought people where trying to kill me And i got weird electric shocks in my head (it got that bad I checked my self into mental health unit and they would not let me out for 2 weeks). I had to go back on the drug and come off it very slowly over about 3 months. I think now I have PTSD. Before taking this drug I only ever had depression and anxiety, but now I&#039;m a total wreck I&#039;ve lost my job my gf I&#039;ve still not got over the shaking. I was only on a low dose for a short period of time."
