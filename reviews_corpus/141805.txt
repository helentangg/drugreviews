"I&#039;m a 47 year old female, been on 10mg Lexapro for 5 years for anxiety and depression that I&#039;ve had since childhood. I had to add 300 mg Wellbutrin XL after, due to feeling overly sedated, and low libido. This combination has worked well for me, since the Wellbutrin has an &quot;up&quot; effect, and helps with sexual side effects. Tried to reduce the Lexapro to 5mg this fall, but had some anxiety start to return, went back to 10mg recently. Maybe just holiday stress. I&#039;m so glad these medicines are around! Wish they could have been available for my brother who committed suicide several years ago. Wish I could have had the Lexapro at an earlier age but thankful now!"
