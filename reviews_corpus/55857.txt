"I have been on Effexor for 15 years 150MG per day except for a 1 year period ending about 6 months ago.  It is very effective for me.  It made me tired when I first started it, but it was worth sticking through that.  For my time not taking it, I was on Zoloft which didn&#039;t work as well.  Effexor has kept me from depression but it does other things for me.  First, it reduces my inattentiveness to near nothing.  Therefore, I am very productive at whatever I do.  Second, it greatly reduces anxiety.  Stress does not cripple me any longer while on this medication.  

Going off the medication has a weird withdrawal symptom that isn&#039;t painful, it&#039;s just odd.  Do not go off the medication without a doctor assisting."
