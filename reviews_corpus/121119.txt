"I have been on and off this med 3 times this year. There is just nothing else that works as good as this med does for me. I&#039;ve tried sertraline 25mg, bupropion 75mg, bupropion SR 75mg and fluoxetine 20mg, but those had no positive outcome like venlafaxine. I was taking 75mg for 3 months on 2 separate occasions and goodness this med kept my mood on the bright side despite any stressors thrown at me this year. I&#039;ve recently gone back down to 37.5mg a day because after a while this med did seem to make me forget to take it at times and it also left me emotionless. I wasn&#039;t depressed anymore, but I couldn&#039;t feel happy for all of the little things either. I was just too &quot;chill,&quot; too content. this med turned my life around! God bless!!"
