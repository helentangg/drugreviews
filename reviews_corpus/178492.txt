"Previously was on Prozac for anxiety and while that worked really really well for 2  years, it sort of stopped working, and nothing helped again until I got on Cymbalta and 1 small dose of clonezapam at night. Now, I&#039;m virtually anxiety free, with just a rare panic attack here and there, treated with other medicines. Cymbalta keeps me pretty even. I&#039;m on the 60mg once daily."
