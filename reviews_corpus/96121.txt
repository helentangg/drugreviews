"I hear amazing reviews on this SSRI, but I cannot relate. I am 23 and I love to work out. Zoloft left me zombified with erectile dysfunction. After coming off of Celexa and trying this SSRI I&#039;m pretty sure SSRI&#039;s aren&#039;t for me. I could not move from my couch and the X-box. I sat there for days no longer WANTING to take care of myself (clean, eat) and I was getting fat. I would speed home every day after work just so I could get to my couch. I slept constantly and binged when I forced myself off the couch. I was lifeless. It brought reality to my world which was amazing! But I didn&#039;t have any energy to enjoy it."
