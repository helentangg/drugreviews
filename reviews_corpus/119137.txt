"Have been on Zoloft for about three years - low dose couple of times per week and really feel it has helped with stress, anxiety, the &quot;what ifs&quot; etc. Makes me more able to tolerate intolerable people and not over react to them. Also helps out with social anxiety and over thinking and analyzing every little thing I may or may not do. No side effects that I have noticed. 

If you think you are irritable or others around you tell you that you may need something follow their unwanted advice and try something it could be life changing."
