"My issue is anxiety.  I have tried Effexor, Lexapro, Prozac, and finally Cymbalta.  Last month, I told my doctor I was done with these medications.  I was willing to live with the anxiety because the uncontrollable weight gain was making me depressed.  He listened and prescribed a very low dose of Cymbalta.   Thank you so MUCH.  I feel so much better.  I am finally able to lose weight without trying.  Before, I could not convince myself to even diet for one day. It was impossible. Never an issue prior and now thankfully I have control over my eating.  I was always ambivalent about everything.  Now things impact me within reason.  I don&#039;t obsess but I still care."
