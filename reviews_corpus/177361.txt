"I have had at least four surgeries for the pain i been having, the last surgeon told me there is nothing she can do for me that I just have chronic pain. I was sent to a chronic pain doctor and they put me on cymbalta, I have been on it for seven months and I&#039;m still in pain. I take 60mg at bed time, i been having mood swings agitated, anxious, etc i dont know if this the medicine i should be taking. I quit my job due to the pain i really need help and don&#039;t know where to turn"
