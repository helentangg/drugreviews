"I was prescribed Effexor XR for anxiety while I was home from college over winter break. I took it one day and I felt good but then I couldn&#039;t sleep for the following entire next day and then it made me feel completely sick so I didn&#039;t take another one the next day because I wanted to be able to fall asleep. 5 days later I tried to take it again to see if I would be able to fall asleep and that time I wasn&#039;t able to fall asleep the next two days and I felt extremely sick and like my brain hurt so bad the next day after taking it. Its been over a week now since the second time I took and I feel like I hate my life. I&#039;ve never been so depressed and anxious. how long will this last? major regret"
