"I have interstitial cystitis for 15 yrs now. I have tried everything. Lyrica worked great for pain but too many side effects.  I am back to amitriptyline.  Works really well and very inexpensive versus thousands for Lyrica.  I even took it during my three pregnancies. All my babies healthy.  Dr said this medicine has been around so long that he was comfortable giving it to me during pregnancy for my pain."
