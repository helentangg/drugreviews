"I started taking sertraline about a month ago, and my life has done a complete 360! This is unbelievable to me, as I have tried many different prescriptions since I was a teenager including Prozac and  Celebrex. This is the first thing I have taken where I am not a zombie. My relationship with my husband has improved by leaps and bounds, I am more patient with our daughter, my work is less stressful. Overall I find I can cope with stresses much easier. Little things don&#039;t tick me off, or make me cry. I used to get really stuck on negative and compulsive thoughts, and had mild OCD as well, and guess what its GONE! Negative thoughts are PASSING thoughts for me now! Its amazing. Thank you to whoever created this wonder medicine. I am ME!"
