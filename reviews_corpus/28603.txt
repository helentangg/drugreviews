"About 3 years ago I was on Lexapro 10mg, then I was off. Then about 9 months ago I was on Lexapro 10mg again then up to 20mg but my libido pretty much became non existent. I had weight gain, I tried working out but it didn&#039;t help the problem. It worked with my anxiety but after a while I felt like it was wearing off and I was becoming accustomed. I had lost my job and had no insurance so I couldn&#039;t afford my Lexapro, so I was cut off up until about 3 days ago. The withdrawals were INSANE, I had so many attacks and brain zaps I really wanted to crash my car into incoming traffic, I would have my mom come pick me up while I would park on the side of the road."
