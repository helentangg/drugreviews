"I tried Paxil in 2000 when I had unstoppable panic attacks.I had been dealing with anxiety all of my life  &amp; those years I had constant panic over a teen addict &amp; a son with learning disabilities and marital issues. This was the first time I had ever taken an AD. The very first day I felt relief from it.However, looking back; the start up dose of 20 mg caused me to be a bit withdrawn &amp; weirdly unresponsive to my family after that first day. As time went on though I began to feel much better &amp; happier. I will say the dose was probably too high as I did make some regretful decisions from not thinking things through,I gained several extra pounds; &amp; &#039;thought&#039; I had sexual side effects; it could have been situational. Not well since stopping."
