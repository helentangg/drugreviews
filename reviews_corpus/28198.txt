"With a rough family life, it&#039;s hard to know if this drug is working to its full potential. I&#039;ve been taking lexepro for almost three months now, and I can hardly tell a difference. I don&#039;t really think of suicide anymore, but happy? Is anyone truly happy? Maybe it&#039;s just my situation at the moment that brings out my pessimistic side, but I don&#039;t feel much different at all."
