"I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder, severe depression and OCD when I was around 18 years old. I couldn&#039;t do anything and shut down. I went to a mental hospital to take classes on how to cope and I began trying different types of SSRI&#039;s. I tried two others and I felt horrible on them both then I tried Zoloft. My mom made me stick with it even though I was skeptical. I started with 25, 50, then to 75 ml. Nothing helped. As soon as I went up to 100 ml is when I felt my life coming back. I could feel emotions of happiness, and felt like life had finally had a meaning to it. I was able to be okay again and felt like this medicine saved my life. The thing that is hardest is all the people judging saying &quot;you&#039;re on so many Meds&quot;"
