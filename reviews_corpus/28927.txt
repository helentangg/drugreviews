"I have only been taking this medication for 2 weeks. It has been pretty up and down for me each and everyday. I requested help for anxiety made worse by PMS. I started on 2.5mg and had scary anxiety, worse than what I was even taking it for, mild dry mouth, dizziness, and head sensations that were not quite painful but annoying. Just when I thought it was getting better, side effects seem to come and go as they please. I know that 2 weeks is not a fair amount of time to evaluate the drug completely and while my PMS was improved this month, I feel different, and not in a good way. I don&#039;t know how much longer I will give it a go."
