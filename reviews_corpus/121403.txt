"I&#039;ve been on this for almost three months at this point for my depression and anxiety. I started at 75 mg, raised to 150 mg, and then lowered back to 75 mg. While it doesn&#039;t at all touch my anxiety, I definitely feel a lot better depression-wise. My psychiatrist raised it to 150 mg in the hopes it would help my anxiety, but it didn&#039;t so we lowered it and simply added 50 mg of Seroquel XR to help the anxiety. I honestly can&#039;t say I really have any side effects. Perhaps I have minor night sweats at times but if there are any side effects I don&#039;t really notice them, and I feel satisfied using this for my depression."
