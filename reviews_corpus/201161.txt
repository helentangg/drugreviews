"I&#039;m on day 3 of zoloft I think I&#039;m going to stop I feel angry more depressed no motivation to do anything, feel like I can&#039;t handle my kids. Super dizzy and over it like 10x more suicidal then I&#039;ve ever been. Also kind of feel numb and like I can&#039;t think properly. 
Not a good feeling and I don&#039;t think its worth waiting it out..."
