"I was on 60mg of Cymbalta for a year or more.  Did not want to be on antidepressants all my life so I weaned off it 2 months ago.  My fibromyalgia pains have returned with a vengeance, more than before.  I am going back to Cymbalta as I want to have some quality of life.  I feel debilitated at the moment.  Have been taking this tablet in the morning but after reading the reviews on this forum I will change to night."
