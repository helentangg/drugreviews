"Been on nortriptyline for less than a week and I absolutely hate it. Started with 20mg first few days but have reduced to 10mg in hopes of minimizing side effects. Having hell of a time falling asleep, low grade headaches and blurred vision. But the worst is the sexual side effect of ED. Had been on 10mg of amitriptyline for years previously. Slept great on that and had no ED problems. Had the fogginess the next day though I had gotten used to that. Planning to switch back but Doc wants me to wait two weeks in hope that side effects will lessen. Have DDD in lower back 4+ years and chronic foot pain from super high arches for 17 years. Pain had increased recently so doc thought Nortriptyline might help better. Also on 900mg Neurontin a day"
