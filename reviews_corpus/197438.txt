"I had anxiety that was getting more and more severe as the days went by. It was really hard to be around people. I would get nervous and stiffen up and also feel very paranoid that people noticed my discomfort. I started to take Paxil starting at 10 mg. For the first little while nothing was different about my anxiety but soon it was so amazing. I was talking so much without getting nervous. I could look people in the eye and could enjoy my life. All of a sudden things were much more bearable. The only bad part was that it made me kinda absent minded like I didn&#039;t really pay attention much, but overall was extremely happy with the results and am glad I only have to take 10 mg a day. Hope my entry helps."
