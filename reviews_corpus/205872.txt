"Reading most of the reviews on here just makes me wonder why not me?  I&#039;m a 28 Female with bipolar 1, anxiety disorder with agoraphobia, OCD (obsessive thoughts but thankfully nothing severe), and adult ADHD.
I&#039;m far from a stranger to the world of therapy, medicines, etc., since I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder at 14.
I&#039;ve been taking Pristiq for about 2 1/2 months. First noticed I felt more tired, then after a few weeks I noticed I felt more anxious than usual and little things would bother me (more) then before and I actually feel more depressed in the sense that I didn&#039;t actually feel depressed as in sad, worthless, etc. more just kinda blah. But I actually feel more sad and unmotivated now, I&#039;ve also gained about 10lbs and Pristiq is the only thing different."
