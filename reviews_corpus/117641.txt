"When I was 47 I was diagnosed with arthritis in my neck which was triggering migraines and shoulder pain. Even 800 mg of Motrin didn&#039;t help. Nortriptyline was a miracle and I am migraine free. I tried going off of it about 4 times, and every time I had headaches and shoulder pain the next day. I am so thankful for Nortriptyline because I can go to work and think clearly without a headache clouding my thoughts."
