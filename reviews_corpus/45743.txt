"This is my second week of taking fluoxetine at 20mg once a day. My mind feels really blank. Don&#039;t feel sad or happy. I feel nothing. I still find it hard to get up in the morning and have found that I have less energy. I have been having side effects of stomach pains and loss of appetite and now my whole body just hurts! I can say though that I worry a whole lot less about my future and that the little things that got me down don&#039;t really bother me as much any more. I will keep taking it as I have seen on these comments that the side effects go away after a while so hopefully if that happens maybe I can really start to enjoy my life again."
