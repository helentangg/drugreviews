"25 year old male. By far the best antidepressant I&#039;ve been on. Initially I had a little trouble with insomnia but it went away after a couple weeks. I also had trouble finding the best time of day to take it. After trying both in the evening and morning I came to the conclusion that its best taken in the morning. Other than insomnia I have experience no other side effects. Additionally my libido has increased substantially, an added bonus. My father has also started Viibryd do to my positive experience. I would definitely recommend this medicine to others."
