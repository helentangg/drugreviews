"I started taking Celexa about 1 1/2 weeks ago, started at 10 mg and upped to 20 three days ago.  I had been on Zoloft prior for about 5 years but it stopped working.  Was off of it for about 2 months before starting Celexa.  Experiencing an increase of anxiety, tiredness and an overall sense of exhaustion.  Does it get better, will these side effects go away eventually?  My doctor said the increased anxiety is not caused by the meds.  Yes I was anxious and needed something but my anxiety is much higher since taking the meds so I don&#039;t necessarily believe the doctor 100%.  I want to stop taking it but I also want to feel &quot;normal&quot; and no these meds can be very helpful.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated."
