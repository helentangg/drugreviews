"I&#039;ve been taking nortriptyline for almost two years. It has proven extremely effective in reducing my migraines. I now get a migraine perhaps five or six times a year compared with one a week previously. It did cause dry mouth at first, though that has abated. And my mood is much improved, possibly because I have fewer headaches and possibly because of the drug&#039;s antidepressive effects. The main problem is weight gain. I feel hungry almost all the time. That said, I&#039;m not ready to return to pre-nortriptyline days and, instead, will work on diet and exercise."
