"I am 21 years old, female. I&#039;ve been on 10mg for about a week now, and this has done wonders for me. I always felt mad and stressed out over little thing. Now I feel like I have more clarity and control. I feel like a weight has been lifted off of my shoulders. The first day was the worst. I felt like I wanted to throw up all day, yet I stuck through it and I am glad I did. I never knew how much stress had affected my everyday life and routine till I got on the pill and saw the changes it had on my moods and behavior. 

Now I don&#039;t snap over little things I use to think were major. I don&#039;t cry over things that would upset me. I feel so much more at ease."
