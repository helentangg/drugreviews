"I&#039;ve dealt with anxiety for the past 7 years, but about 2 months ago it got really bad. I started having at least one panic attack a day and it was really scary. I&#039;m not a depressed person, but the anxiety was making me feel that way because I didn&#039;t know if I would go back to &quot;normal&quot; - I finally decided to see the doctor and tried Zoloft. I didn&#039;t have any side effects, just mild anxiety that got better day to day. A couple of high anxiety days in between, but all in all... I was getting back to myself. Here I am, a couple of months later and COMPLETELY back to normal! I feel so happy and thankful that I decided to try medicine."
