"After I had postpartum depression after 2 weeks of giving birth then my 9 months through it got really worse. I would always snap at my boyfriend about the little things. I got irritated very easily and would cry everyday. All I wanted to do was sleep. I also tried counseling before deciding to take medicines. I just felt like a horrible mom. I took Celexa and after a week I felt the change in me right away. I felt more about things and my anxiety went away. I had more energy to do things and more motivated to do things. I love being me again."
