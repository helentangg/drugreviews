"Started taking it over the summer on a starter pack. I hate eating, and if you don&#039;t eat with this med, you&#039;re going downhill. Nausea, vomiting, major headaches, and more black and white BPD symptoms than without. Was placed on Deplin with it, but felt sick all the time. Haven&#039;t been back since school started due to other things, and in all honesty, the meds made it hard. Everything was elevated. Nightmares were worse. Little day to day events, terrible. A simple manic episode that I was used to? 12 times higher. Really disliked it."
