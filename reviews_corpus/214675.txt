"I had bad anxiety for a few months because of university. I was always afraid of failing (I study statistics). It had a huge negative impact on the quality of my life. I often cried, I had no appetite anymore and sometimes I even threw up. Then I started taking 5mg of Escitalopram for two to three months. After that I took 10 mg.I don&#039;t remember when the positive effects started kicking in exactly. But it took at least 6 weeks. By now (I started taking it February, now it is August) I don&#039;t have any anxiety anymore. At first my libido decreased significantly. I feel like this got better, but I am not sure. 
I gained weighed, but not because of the drug directly, but because I was able to eat again normally."
