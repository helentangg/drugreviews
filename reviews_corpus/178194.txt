"I took Cymbalta for about 3-4 months. I had major side effects. I tried taking it at night but I couldn&#039;t sleep. Switched to the mornings and I also had tingling all over, sexual side effects, worsened my suicidal thoughts. The only good thing about it is I totally had no appetite what so ever. I lost 15 lbs. I have since quit taking Cymbalta."
