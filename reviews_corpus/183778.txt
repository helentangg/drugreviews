"I&#039;ve been on Cymbalta for a year now. I had a bad truck wreck and had to have my neck fused. I was taking 60mg of hydrocodone and it kept me from taking care of my company. Started with 60mg  of Cymbalta and after about six months went to 30mg. Things so far have been great. My wife is happy because my bad temper has gone. Side affects have been, sweating bad at night and less sleep. Over all it has been a life saver."
