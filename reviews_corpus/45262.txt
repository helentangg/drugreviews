"I have been on this medication for around 12 years 60mg a day for OCD and depression, it got me out of a very very deep hole, got me back to work able to function got me back as a normal person, u fortuantly i used alcohol and recreational drugs aswell which made me riddled with anxiety and depression, im clean and sober 8years now and am still on the prozac, iv recently had a low episode and i was self medicating with my prozac as and when i needed, obviously this wasnt the greatest ideas and this has led me back to being depressed again but im back on 40mg of prozac a day, i may feel like i have gone back to the begining of it all but i havent iv just had a little set back in my recovery, all in all prozac for me is a life saver"
