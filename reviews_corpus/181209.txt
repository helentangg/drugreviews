"I was prescribed 2-3 weeks ago...was so happy to finally have something I thought would help prescribed to me. I tried it for two days...felt my depression/scary scenarios get worse, so I stopped. Depression was still there but not as bad as it is when I am on the pill. I took it again to see if it will finally work this time...it&#039;s my 3rd day, still feeling worse but I&#039;m trying to wait for it to work because I&#039;ve read it works after 2-3 weeks. So I hope it helps... :/"
