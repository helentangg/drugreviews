"I have been suffering from anxiety for several years. My mind was racing, I would have anxiety attacks, shake from nerves....I felt like a prisoner in my own body. I often felt like I had no control and worried about everything going on in my life. My doctor prescribed 10mg of lexapro and it has literally changed my life. I can now get through the day without the overwhelming worry and anxiety I was living with every single day. Initially the side effects were tough, fatigue, sleeplessness, and headache.....they faded quickly. Recommend taking it before bed. I am thrilled with lexapro and can not say enough about what a change this medication has made on my life."
