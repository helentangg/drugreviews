"I had Shingles in March and was given two meds - one was an antiviral and the other for pain.   The pain pill they gave me didn&#039;t mix with my meds.  I went without the pain med.  Then the beginning of April the pain came. It got worse and worse. April, May, June, July ever increasing pain around the shingles area. Went to my family doctor in Jul and she prescribed Doloxtine 30mg.  Well I read the pill first.  I read and wanted to avoid ALL Side affects.  So I continued without the pill and took tramadol and a local ointment.  The pain was constant and intense. Aug 3 back to my family Doc. She insisted I try the  Doloxtine about 3 days later almost no pain. Yesterday she increased it to 60mg.  So far so good, I shouldn&#039;t be so stubborn."
