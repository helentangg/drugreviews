"I suffer from PTSD from my military experiences. I am in my early 40&#039;s female. I to find that 25 mg works for me. Any thing more and I have several side effects. Seriously, I am told it isn&#039;t much. it seems to be just enough. Without it I am grumpy and a bit mean, negative in my head and really anxious around crowds. With it I am normal, nice, funny, easy going, and my head is still clear because of the low dose."
