"After taking this medicine on a few occasions over the years I realised its not for me, anyone I know seems to have the same negative experience I had, it done nothing for my wellbeing, as matter of fact I was sectioned after a few months on it!!! I now completely refuse to take it. I see some other reviews of people on it years saying it&#039;s working? How so if you are on it years? It is not supposed to be a brain numbing lifetime drug..there are better ones out there...there is an element of being able to live drug free in this too...I feel like maybe the pharmaceutical companies are getting their pockets lined. People become too dependent on this drug...in my opinion it should be off the market! I am able to live antidepressant free now.."
