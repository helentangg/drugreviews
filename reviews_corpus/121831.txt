"I have been on Effexor XR on and off for about 14 years. At first it seems to work but then I end up going back to where I was and then worse. I have suicidal thoughts at all times. I&#039;m depressed and agitated even more so now than ever. If I get an up dose I sweat more. I don&#039;t know what to do. "
