"I was on venlafaxine for about 4 years. I didn&#039;t realize until, now that I&#039;m off of it, all of the side effects I suffered while taking it.
I had chronic constipation, followed by a most recent period of explosive diarrhea.
Anytime I missed a dose or was late in taking it, the dizziness and nausea would set in. Those would disappear after taking the missed dose.I gained so much weight. I was a little overweight when I started, but the pounds kept piling on, and were literally impossible to take off despite a very good diet and exercise. I had an intense craving for alcohol, to the point of throwing up from excess drinking. After a weaning off period, I&#039;m on Welbutrin now. Losing weight, not drinking, and feeling much better."
