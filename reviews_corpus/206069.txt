"I have been on Pristiq for about 2 weeks now. I was taking 20MG of Lexapro (and gained almost 30 lbs in 2 months) and Effexor, which did absolutely nothing to help me. Pristiq kicked in right after the first dose. My husband was diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer in 2003. He died in 2006. We had been married for 43 years. After 2 years, I still had not gotten back to my old self. After 2 days on Pristiq, I almost felt my normal self again. Thank you."
