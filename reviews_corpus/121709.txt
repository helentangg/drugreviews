"I have had fibromyalgia symptoms for over 2 years now, muscle cramps that stay in a locked position for days.  I am in constant pain.  I have only been on venlafaxine  for not quite a week and have to admit it has controlled the pain to a dull ache instead of the throbbing pain before.  My doctor started me out on 37.5 mgs and after 4 days we increased it to 75 mgs.  I seem to tolerate this dosage well.  I am happy with the benefit of helping my anxiety level. I see hope at the end of the pain tunnel."
