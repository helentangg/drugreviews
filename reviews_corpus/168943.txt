"I like this medicine but after reading some reviews I have confirmed some things.  First, I am experiencing insomnia and worsening of my restless legs.  Second the constant sweet cravings and never feeling satisfied after I eat is annoying.  I have had about a 4-5 lbs. Weight gain.  It is like someone takes over and I just eat.  I have no impulse control.  Third, the gas and bloating is awful.  I am fine in the morning but as soon as I start eating I start bloating and developing gas.  I cannot expel it and it makes me so uncomfortable.  It has worked some to level out my depression but I am contemplating weaning off for now."
