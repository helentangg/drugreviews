"This medicine helped for depression.  The problem is, the first time I went up to 40mg, (within 2 hours), I started sweating profusely and was super nauseous.  After 5 days of this, I am going to switch medicines.  The sad thing is it does help with depression but I can&#039;t handle feeling nauseous all the time."
