"Cymbalta works for me, I have symptoms of PTSD and have tried other medications for my anxiety such as: PAXIL, CELEXA, and PROZAC with no good results. So far so good with Cymbalta with minimal sexual side effects for me. Psychotherapy and Physical Fitness is recommended if you use this medication."
