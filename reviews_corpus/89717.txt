"I started taking this medication about 2 and a half years ago, and I am now having to be taken off it, just for the fact of it&#039;s not helping me anymore. When I first started taking this medicine it helped me out a lot. I just went through a two and half year break up and fell as it&#039;s just not strong enough. I&#039;m taking 80mg a night, and its just not helping. So I got prescribed Pristiq today and now going to see how it works. Hopefully it does."
