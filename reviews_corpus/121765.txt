"I started having disabling panic attacks 2008.  Was first put on Paxil CR.  Stopped after 2 yrs cause I was grazing on food and gained weight.  In 2013, attacks came back with a vengeance after death of my Dad. Put on Sertaline.  Love how it made me feel, so mellow but grazing one again.  Gained 20 pounds in 6 months!  Stop that med now on Effexor for two months.  Don&#039;t feel like grazing.  Mood is pretty okay. In the meantime, found out I had allergy to dairy, wheat &amp; sugar.  Eliminate them and feel marvelous combined with Effexor.  Exercise, proper food, and a good drug makes all the difference.  Good luck."
