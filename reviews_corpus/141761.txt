"I have been on Lexapro for about 3 weeks now. I&#039;ve been suffering from bad depression and anxiety pretty much all of my life, and I&#039;ve tried almost all of the other SSRI and SNRIs. I discontinued all of the others due to horrible sexual side effects or bad sweating and night sweats. I have been really pleased with Lexapro so far; I haven&#039;t been sweating at night, which is a real blessing because I had that effect with pretty much all of the other SSRIs. I have noticed a reduction in my libido, but it doesn&#039;t seem to affect my ability to have and enjoy sexual activity. It doesn&#039;t seem as strong as the others in terms of lifting my depression or anxiety, but I might just need to give it a little more time."
