"Since the age of 13 I&#039;ve been on antidepressants, fluoxetine, mirtazipine, lorazepam, citalopram. The list goes on. I&#039;m 25 now and I&#039;ve been on sertraline for the past two month after all the other medicines failed to lift my mood. Its the first time in my life I&#039;ve ever felt free, to me this is a miracle. I can easily put up with the occasional side effects (nausea, insomnia) because I no longer wake up with suicidal thoughts or anxiety about leaving the house."
