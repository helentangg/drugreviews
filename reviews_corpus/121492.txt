"The first week was horrendous. Hot and cold sweats, fever, delusional was willing to quit this medicine after 3 days. All I can say is stick with it, after that taking this drug works wonders slightly europhic, calm, relaxed. If anyone is having doubts with this medicine (stick with it) and if it doesn&#039;t work with you, you will sure find out. Anti depressants don&#039;t work for me but this is a God send, would recommend!"
