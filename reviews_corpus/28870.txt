"I have been on lexapro for a week and it&#039;s been a ride. I have had horrible side effects from the start. Really bad headaches, night sweats, frequent suicidal thoughts. It has had an opposite effect on me. My depression/anxiety are worse. I sleep way too much. I also have experienced loss of appetite while a lot of people gain weight. I&#039;ve lost 9 pounds in a week, which is really weird because my weight has been the same for years. I never really gain or lose so I know it&#039;s the medicines. I&#039;m hoping that all the bad side effects will pass. I don&#039;t want to give up on the drug yet. I&#039;m going to at least try and stick it out for a month."
