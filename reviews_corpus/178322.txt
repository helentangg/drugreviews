"A miracle for me. Effexor for 6 yrs makes me feel like having heart failure. Always out of breath when walking short distance. Every time I changed medicines I&#039;d get really sick. Thought I was doomed to Effexor. New Doctor, now Cymbalta. After what I read, since I&#039;m so sensitive to medicines I totally expected to be sick to my stomach and dizzy. I&#039;m still on 30mg, 3 more days go to 60mgs. The change is great so far. No side effects everyone is different. It takes so long to find the medicine that&#039;s right for you. I can&#039;t work, on disability."
