"Started 20mg about 6 months ago with another AD, seems to take the edge off my depression better than anything else I&#039;ve tried. I&#039;ve been through the gauntlet was in 3 different hospitals and on a handful of different meds. I tried ECT twice and I think that made me worse...was approved for TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation) did 45 treatments and still don&#039;t feel like my old self. I&#039;m now on 40mg viibryd and 100mg pristiq and am relatively stable. I have to use the bathroom at least 5+ times a day the diarrhea side effect just won&#039;t go away. My doc doesn&#039;t want to try new meds anymore so I&#039;m stuck on my current regimen till I find a new doc. I&#039;d recommend Viibryd if you can deal with the side effects."
