"I am 28 and this is the 5th drug I have taken in the last 6 years. The side effects from everything made the stressed out anxious feeling almost more appealing - from Paxil, Effexor, Zoloft. I am sure there was another one or 2 in there somewhere- I think that I should have been put on a low dose of Prozac a LONG time ago. I have only taken it for a couple weeks or so but I don&#039;t feel the side effects of the other medications. There is no longer a veil over me. I feel good but still like myself. I am hoping this is how I continue to feel. My kids and fiance deserve to have a happy me in their lives. I am happy for those who have found what they need to cope, for those who haven&#039;t, don&#039;t give up!"
