"I&#039;m taking Duloxetine 20mg per day for anxiety and minor depression. I have taken this med for almost two months and keep a daily journal. As a &#039;blind study&#039; I started this drug without my wife&#039;s knowledge. I noticed a decrease in my overall anxiety in ten (10) days and my wife mentioned my calmness in two weeks. I am a 70 year old male and I supplement Duloxetine with Buspar on an &#039;as needed&#039; basis for anxiety. The Duloxetine seems to smooth things out without the numbing effect of a benzodiazepine. I&#039;m on the minimum available dosage and will soon ask my PCP to up my dosage to 40mg per day. There have been absolutely no bad side effects from the drug."
