"I started taking Celexa almost 3 weeks ago. For the first week I took half a pill (10 mg). Then I went almost two weeks on 20 mg. I felt it working at first, but then my mood swings were coming back and so was the depression. I just had it upped yesterday to 40 mg, along with Ativan 1 mg for panic/anxiety and Trazodone 50 mg for sleep. It was working well for awhile, so I&#039;m assuming I just needed it to be increased. I LOVE the fact it doesn&#039;t make you eat more or feel &quot;weird&quot; like most depression medications. I am very happy with this medicine and can&#039;t wait to have my life back."
