"The first 3 days of taking this I couldn&#039;t stop yawning!! I was literally yawning about once every minute. This went on for hours, it was incredibly annoying (although I&#039;ve heard this is a very rare side effect). Finally after 3 days the yawning subsided. On the 4th day I was so nauseous I couldn&#039;t even eat. Now I&#039;m 3 weeks in, I still sometimes get nauseous but nowhere near to the extent that I was nauseous on day 4. Also my sex life has drastically taken a hit. I went from being a very sexual person to now not finding any pleasure in sex at all. Also my mind is foggy and I&#039;m very distracted. I&#039;m stopping the medication today because I haven&#039;t seen any improvements in my anxiety."
