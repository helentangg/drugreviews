"Bad withdrawal symptoms when trying to quit. I had horrible depression when trying to wean off. Also didn&#039;t like how I felt on it. Took my imagination away, ability to day dream. Gave me high blood pressure. You must get on medicines for high blood pressure. So either stop Pristiq or get high blood pressure meds if you need it."
