"I&#039;ve suffered with chronic back and neck pain, fibromyalgia, debilitating chronic migraines and insomnia for 20yrs. For ten of the last 13 I took 150mg amitrptyline with an opiate pain killer and had my pain and migraines under control and quality of life. 3yrs ago my Dr. had to retire due to heart problems. I have a new pain management specialist but they only have me on 25mg amitrptyline and have me  taking Neurotin instead. I&#039;ve had horrifying insomnia ever since. Now I also have terrible neuopathy and parathisia and also interstalial cystalis, IBS, and  have no quality of life any more. But now because of all your comments I have the courage to tell my Dr. I want my dosage raised because I know what works for me. Thank you all! "
