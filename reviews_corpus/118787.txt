"I have been on Zoloft for the past two months.  In that time, I have been less angry and anxious.  However, I have gained 20 lbs.  I have had gastric banding surgery and I follow Weight Watchers.  I stay within my food intake guidelines and in the past month I have introduced exercise.  I was losing weight steadily at a healthy rate before I started on Zoloft.  Even though the medication is working to help my anxiety/OCD/and depression, I am willing to try another medication because the weight gain is one of the issues affecting my moods.  It may work for some, but I am finding more and more people who have had a drastic weight gain while taking the medicine."
