"I&#039;ve been on Lexapro for two months now. The first 4 weeks I had very minor side effects. Dry mouth, dilated pupils, etc. VERY minor and only lasted 2 days each. Two months later I can tell you this medication is amazing. I suffered from very periodic anxiety which turned into panic attacks on some occasions. It was always in the back of my mind as to if or when it was going to happen. That&#039;s no way to live. I feel focused with clear thought now. I still laugh and feel every emotion...I just don&#039;t worry about things like I used to before Lexapro. I&#039;m happier and have a more positive outlook on difficult situations in my life now. I find myself being much more social now too. Miracle medication for sure!"
