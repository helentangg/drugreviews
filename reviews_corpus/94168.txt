"This drug causes persistent nausea in some users as per their website. For most people it goes away after a few weeks--but not all. Initially I was also itchy and a little weepy (went away after 2 weeks). If you have a history of being unusually nausea prone (ie pregnancy) in my experience you may wind up in the persistent nausea group. I will have to switch as I don&#039;t want to be chained to zofran. Otherwise, worked fine as an alternative to paxil. Fewer side effects--unfortunately the one side effect it did cause is pretty debilitating in my case!"
