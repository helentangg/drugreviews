"Lexapro is a life saver. I have been on it for about a week and a half now and I am already seeing a dramatic improvement. My panic attacks, anxiety and depression are gone. FINALLY, my mood is more stable now and I&#039;m beginning to be able to think positive about the future. I&#039;m glad I will be around to see another day."
