"I was prescribed 10 mg a day for anxiety/panic attacks. I&#039;d never taken any sort of SSRI before. I took one pill and it scared me, I threw up several hours later and had the worst panic attack of my life. But I don&#039;t know if that was me, or the pill. So two weeks later, I chopped it in half and have taken 5mg everyday for the past 6 months. It has completely turned down the volume of anxiety and paranoia. I may never be able to go off of it. I have not had weight gain, anorgasmia, or decreased sex drive. I love it. I can live my life, it has taken that fog surrounding everything away. If you are super sensitive to medications like me, I encourage you to start with the lowest dose possible."
