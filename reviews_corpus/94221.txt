"This medicine saved me!  I have always been a very happy and successful person.  Depression and anxiety were not a part of my life until I hit 43. So I went to doctors and they had me try a few other meds, Zoloft, etc.. I didn&#039;t see any positive affect from them, just the the problems....lack of sleep, night sweats, sexual problems, etc. Things were getting worse.  Then, my doctor put me on this medication and everything changed.  First I started getting headaches for a few days.  That went away by the end of the first week.  I started on 5mg and then went to 10mg after a week.  By the end of week two, my panic attacks were GONE!  I still &quot;think&quot; about my problems, but don&#039;t obsesses about them.  This is a GOOD medicine!"
