"I was prescribed these for insomnia and anxiety. I&#039;ve been on every anti-depressant you can think of, all with awful side effects. I do get a dry mouth, tiredness, headaches and mild anxiety with Amitryptaline, but it&#039;s much more manageable - I was suffering from daily, pretty constant anxiety before starting Amitryptaline. I&#039;m on 30mg. My sleep is 90% better (which after 12 years of chronic insomnia is a amazing)."
