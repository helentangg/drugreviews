"I have clinical depression and Prozac is how I initially got introduced to the world of pharmaceuticals. I took two types of Fluoxetine; one from the hospital (green) and the other from Target (white). While the ones given to me at the hospital worked good, the ones from Target did not work AT ALL!! 

The side effects for me were: No ability to feel any emotion, zombie like, tired 24/7, no appetite (I lived off of one slice of pizza a day along with some cranberry juice and it had to be forced down), decreased libido, giddiness, constant mind fog, a feeling of euphoria followed by fatigue, dry mouth.

It worked better than Cymbalta but since fluoxetine is generic, my doctor doesn&#039;t approve of it."
