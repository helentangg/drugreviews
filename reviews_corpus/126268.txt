"Have been a very angry man for a long time, and was fed up with being mad and guilty about my anger. Bit the bullet and went to the doctor all my blood work was green. So we tried Viibryd I&#039;m on week 4 and no adverse reactions beyond mild dry mouth, and a tighness in my jaw muscles. I think this is what normal people feel like, I feel happy, less guilt, WAY less anger. BUT blue cross says they might not pay for it, however if I continue to feel this way, or better I will pay for it gladly. I recommend it."
