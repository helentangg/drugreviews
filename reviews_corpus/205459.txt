"I have been on Pristiq for the past 12 months. I started on 50mg and went up to 100 mg after about 3 months. The side effects were terrible for the first two weeks. I have no side effects now except insomnia - however i have had insomnia for many years, i just have to make sure i have Pristiq as soon as i get up. I am a much happier and relaxed person and it helped save my marriage. My husband is a saint but only a saint can take so much :)"
