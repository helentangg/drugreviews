"I&#039;ve had RA for 56 years, and of course pain. Before having my gastric surgery I had tremendous pain in my lower back. A nurse friend who also as RA said I should try it, I took 30mg the first night and rocketed out of bed the next morning; the second night/morning the same thing, no pain and the flexibility to jump right out of bed. The third night I was wondering if I was just having a good couple of mornings, so I skipped the dose; I woke up at 2am with excruciating pain and downed the cymbalta. The next morning around 9am, I launched out of bed forgetting all about any pain. Bottom line, for me it was a God send, like most meds; you can&#039;t expect everyone to react the same. It&#039;s not rocket science people, get a weeks worth of samples."
