"February 2015 I had an overdose due to depression. I still haven&#039;t admitted I was depressed but the anxiety is real. I couldn&#039;t go to class when I did go to school. My stomach would go crazy and my mind wouldn&#039;t stop racing. I was then put on Paxil. I have been on it for a year and a half now and I&#039;m trying to get off it. not that it isn&#039;t working for my anxiety but my emotions are uncontrollable when I try to get off it and when I am on it I feel like I&#039;m just going. I find myself looking back on a week and not remembering a time I took to just chill and think. because Paxil thinks for me. I don&#039;t like that so I am trying to get off it."
