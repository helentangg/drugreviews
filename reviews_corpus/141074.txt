"I started on lexam 20mg (escitalopram,) three days ago after having a three month break from mirtazipine 30mg, which I took for 16 months. The first night I took lexam, I experienced some side effects about 1&amp;1/2 hours after taking it. I felt dizzy and my heart rate increased. I felt out of breath &amp; had to lie down. Overall the experience itself was highly entertaining and much better than the depressive state I had been. When I first took lexam, I went from being anxious and severely depressed to feeling much better about my life, even after only 3 days. Don&#039;t give up on this medication. It truly works."
