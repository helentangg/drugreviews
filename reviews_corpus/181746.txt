"I suffer bouts of depression and have been prescribed Prozac. This medication does stop the weepiness and severe irritability that I suffer, however it made me feel &quot;nothing&quot; rather than good.  Additionally, the side effects that I suffer on Prozac are not worth the marginal lack of hopeless feelings. I felt nauseous, hollow, scattered and my libido completely vanished.  This led to marital stress, so I went off of it on my own.  I think it is the wrong chemical for my type of brain chemistry or depression."
