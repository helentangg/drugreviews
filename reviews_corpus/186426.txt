"Both my husband I started taking Pristiq for about a month and it has changed our lives. We are both what we once were and are &quot;supposed to be&quot;. It has cleared our concentration and thinking and memory issues and we both feel &quot;normal&quot;. Gone is the out of the blue sadness, anger and lack of motivation or interest in anything. We both feel great now and we are both losing weight like crazy. It&#039;s been 3 weeks for me and I am already down two pant sizes! I can hardly believe it! I am not starving constantly anymore like I used to be on other medicines and I eat when I need to instead of eating to fill an emptiness. I love Pristiq so far."
