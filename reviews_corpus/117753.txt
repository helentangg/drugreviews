"I was given this medication for diagnosis of Raeders Paratrigeminal Neuralgia.  Before I began this medication I had severe migraine headaches daily, facial twitching and eye drooping, amnesia, and blurred vision to the point of not driving.  After taking the medication for two weeks, all of my symptoms have ceased.  Side effects have been small hives and constipation."
