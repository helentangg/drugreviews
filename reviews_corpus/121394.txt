"This medicine is horrible! I&#039;m an average 20 year old that doesn&#039;t drink, smoke or do drugs. I&#039;ve had anxiety since HS, and only recently realized it. I thought a &quot;magic&quot; pill would make my anxiety disappear, boy was I wrong. My doc prescribed me to take the 37.5 mg dose for like 5 days, then get a refill for 75 mg. The 75 mg gave me bad headaches everyday. I let her know and she prescribed me just to take the 37.5 mg, and stressed to never miss a dose. I followed what she said and I felt OK on the 37.5 mg until I started to notice hair thinning and loss! I have a head full of thick hair, never experienced hair loss in my life! The doc lied said it&#039;s just the anxiety. Lies! I weaned myself off after 3 months, withdrawals are the worst."
