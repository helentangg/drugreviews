"Started taking Zoloft four days ago and can already tell the difference.  I was having trouble driving because I had several panic attacks while doing so.  I have driven every day since starting the Zoloft and it hasn&#039;t bothered me yay!  The only side effect I notice is it upsets my stomach, but I have found if I take it with a smoothie it doesn&#039;t."
