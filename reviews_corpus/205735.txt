"I&#039;ve been on this medicine for about  two years and my experience has been positive. I feel happier, more comfortable in my skin, less irritable, mentally sharper than I&#039;ve ever been. It&#039;s been very effective!  The only downsides have been sex drive and some inconsistency in it&#039;s effects.  Sometimes I feel as though the potency of the medicine can vary month to month. 
Last year I tried to slowly come off of it over a two month period. Unfortunately, all the symptoms started coming back. It was a reminder of how hard life was before this medicine. I wish all of you the best."
