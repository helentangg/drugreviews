"I&#039;ve been on Paxil close to a week now. It took the doctor close to two month for me to agree to trying it. I tried everything to overcome my anxiety naturally and I really felt like I hit breaking point. Because I have two young children, I knew it was important that I gave this a go...even though I&#039;m in early days my mind seems content. I&#039;m still trying to get used to it though. After stressing about trivial stuff for so long its strange to feel that I have my life back."
