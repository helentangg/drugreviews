"I just recently started taking it (a little less than 2 weeks ago). The first day I was very giddy and kept getting a tingly feeling from my head to my toes.  Than it stopped after the second day but I did experience the hot sweats, loss of appetite, nausea and lack of sleep. The sleep was the worst thing! I woke up almost every hour every night for 2 weeks straight!  I was either waking up and feeling wired or waking up because of the hot sweats and I&#039;m only 23!  If you want advice, do not take caffeine until some of these side effects go away because it will make you way more wired than usual and you&#039;ll feel very uncomfortable.  Also, do not DRINK ALCOHOL. 1 sip of wine and felt dizzy for at least an hour!"
