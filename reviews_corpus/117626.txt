"Was diagnosed with somatic pain. Prescribed 10mg nortriptyline to start. Took one pill and it made me feel like I could jump off a building and fly. When I laid down it felt like I was floating. Went to sleep, woke up feeling like a zombie, very depressed, could barely lift my arms. It has been three days and I still feel spaced out. "
