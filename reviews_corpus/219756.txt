"I have had cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) since I was at young as 16 but only got diagnosed a week ago at almost 31. I was misdiagnosed even told I was anorexic and bulimic at the same time but never got any answers and never comfort. My CVS went dormant for a while when I was 18 and I believed the dr that told me I produced too much acid but at 28 my CVS came back with a vengeance. I couldn&#039;t keep a job until I went back to an employer I had prior to getting sick again that knew my worth and was willing to work with me and keep me employed thankfully. I would have had no way to come up with 1200 bucks for my tests to rule out everything else and finally found my miracle doctor.  He gave me amitriptyline 25mg at bedtime 5 nights ago and since I have been fine no episodes or symptoms"
