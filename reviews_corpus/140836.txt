"I had terrible anxiety and the beginnings of depression.  I&#039;d had bouts of depression throughout my life, and in October 2015 it became seriously challenging and I felt unable to cope.  For the first time I asked my doctor for help and he suggested counseling with a psychologist and he also prescribed 10 mg of Lexapro (generic).  For the first 3 weeks I had terrible diarrhea (which oddly at the time I did not associate with the Lexapro), and night sweats.  I stuck with it, my doctor increased the dose to 15 mg and a couple weeks later to 20 mg.  It then was reduced back to 10 mg in February and I&#039;ve been taking 10 mg per day since then (now it&#039;s May 30th).  This medicine has helped me so much!  It let me &quot;feel clearly&quot; and changed my life."
