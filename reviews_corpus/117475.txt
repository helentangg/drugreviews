"I&#039;ve smoked 40 years. Tried to quit before and never was successful. Somehow taking this medication it seemed easier. I have been smoke free now 2 months. I took the medication for 1 month prior to quitting and then went cold turkey. I take 75 mg daily when I go to bed. I have been instructed to take this medication for full 6 months after quitting.

Cons: dry mouth, flatulence, lower sex drive, some weight gain, groggy in the morning, increased appetite, harder to urinate (dribbling).

Pros: No anxiety around quitting smoking, seemed easier this time, medication is covered on drug plan, I feel committed and have been (no bargaining with myself to have &#039;just one&#039;), It works!

Pro&#039;s outweigh the cons because I have quit. Cons are temporary!"
