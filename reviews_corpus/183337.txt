"I tried Cymbalta for chronic calf pain due to small fiber neuropathy. I did not experience brain zaps, night terrors or headaches but it did make me sleep a lot while i acclimated. I got up to 120mg/day but did not get any pain relief; still, it seemed to help with my attitude so i kept it at 60mg for a while. Ultimately I ended up getting better results from Pamelor."
