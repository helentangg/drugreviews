"I&#039;m day 4 on Pristiq.  I&#039;ve always hated being medicated to treat my depression and anxiety, for some time I had been doing okay with managing it on my own but recent events in my life sent me for a downward spin so I had to start the medicine. The first day was awful, I was dizzy, nauseated, shaky and for a period of 2 hours I was hit with a serious wave of paranoia I&#039;ve never felt before. I wasn&#039;t keen to keep taking it after that but I&#039;ve stuck it out. My doctor had to give me a sedative to help level me out because I was going up and down, mood completely unpredictable.  Today is the first day I&#039;ve taken the sedative with Pristiq, so far so good. I&#039;ve had to be on leave from work until things are a bit more balanced."
