"Celexa has been an absolute life saver for me.  Maybe even literally.  My psychiatrist put me on Celexa in the midst of major depression.  I take 40mgs twice a day and about a month after starting this, my depression ended.  At first I had some suicidal thoughts, but I don&#039;t know if that was the medication or my depression. Highly recommended for depression. "
