"My life before this god send medicine was awful agitated, stressed with no reason, light depressed I couldn&#039;t think straight. 2 months of taking this drug felt it  relieved all . I take only 10mg of cipralex. Please all IBS suffers I know what painful IBS are and embarrassing. please don&#039;t give up try this you wouldn&#039;t feel relieved for awhile may be 1 or 2 or 3 months  but it will work - don&#039;t give up. I hope IBS suffers find this helpful for them.

thank you a&#039;ll"
