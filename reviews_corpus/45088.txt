"I have been on these now for around 4 months - they really are impressive.
I was previously on Citalopram and Sertraline but didn&#039;t find these to be any help, so these were next in my thoughts to try. 
I have suffered from anxiety, BDD, panics, OCD, overactive thoughts and depressive mood for some time now, and I was recommended to go on these because i was feeling so low always. I also experienced high amounts of anger outbursts from the issues, which have now been cut down greatly thanks to these tablets. Taking these has also improved my relationships. Although I am far from being mentally well, I am happy to say that i am now more stable and hopefully more able to manage the problems better than before.
