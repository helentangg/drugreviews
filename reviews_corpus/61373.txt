"I have been taking Citalopram for 5 yrs and have had no side effects.  My sister &amp; niece take the same thing (&amp; same dose) and swear it makes them sleepy.  As for Yawning as another person mentioned, I start yawning every evening @ 8pm.  Regardless whether I&#039;m tired or not.  I&#039;ve done this long before I ever started taking Citalopram so can probably say for sure it&#039;s not because of the med.  I have very little to no yawning during the day.  90% of the time, if I yawn during the day, it&#039;s because someone in the house has yawned or I see it on tv...and it makes me yawn.  I also take an antidepressant at night, one which helps me sleep. so between the two, it pretty much keeps me stable."
