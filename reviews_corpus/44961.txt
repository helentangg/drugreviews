"This was prescribed for my 14-year-old&#039;s anxiety/depression and panic attacks.  It turned our lives upside down, my daughter was on it for three terrible weeks.  It increased her anxiety and the severity of her panic attacks by a lot.  The black box warning happened, my daughter was suicidal  on several occasions.  We did gene testing during this time (Genomind) and it showed she would have an adverse reaction to it.  Took her off of it and within two days she felt much better.  Genetic testing should be protocol for all doctors prescribing these meds, and please be cautious giving your teenager anti-depressants."
