"Effexor has been the most effective antidepressant for me. I&#039;ve tried 5  SSRI&#039;s. Effexor doesn&#039;t make me lazy or spaced out. I feel it helps my cognitive functioning, as well as focus, motivation and memory. I will go off effexor for periods of time, plenty of time for my brain/body to reset, but I keep finding it better to be on Effexor. It&#039;s helped me to not be so negative, irritable and just miserable overall. I can feel its slight pain killing effects as well. It keeps me doing things instead of laying in bed ruminating negative thoughts. Side effects for me are constipation and lower libido. Miralax fixes the first one. As for the second one, before Effexor I wasn&#039;t socializing at all anyways, so the I can handle that side effect."
