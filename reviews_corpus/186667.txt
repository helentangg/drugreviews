"I&#039;ve been on this medication for 4 weeks now. While I&#039;m sure the benefits are still yet to take full effect I still feel confident in saying this drug has been a major success! I&#039;ve been diagnosed primarily with anxiety and major depressive disorders, and have been on Paxil, Zoloft, Remeron, and Effexor. I was told to try this for it&#039;s less likely occurrence of side effects. No sexual side effects! Finally, this kicked in by week 1 with the others. No weight gain- in fact I&#039;ve lost 5 lbs with no change in diet or appetite (though I&#039;ve heard it&#039;s common.) I have had a little insomnia, but for me the benefits outweigh the negatives. Hope this helps someone!"
