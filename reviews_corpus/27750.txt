"I&#039;ve been taking Lexapro 10mg (5mg at first to build up slowly) for about 6 weeks.  I did feel nauseous for a few days. I noticed a change about a week after starting.  I take lithium and Wellbutrin- but those only seemed to help my anxiety.  I still had intermittent depression- I would just get into these moods where one little thing would put me in a fog of sadness and hopelessness.  I cried a lot, was distracted, and had a lot of negative racing thoughts.  
My provider recommended Lexapro since it works on a different neurotransmitter than Wellbutrin.  
I just feel normal.  I don&#039;t feel like things are dulled - just that I can control my reaction better.  I can feel sad, but I don&#039;t feel depressed. I don&#039;t dwell on feeling sad."
