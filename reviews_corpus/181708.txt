"I have been on fluoxetine now for 7 months. The first couple of weeks I was sick feeling but within 2 months my husband and I could tell a big difference with my anxiety. The down fall is the weight gain and after about 3 months I have to take a midday nap. I have gain 18 pounds in the past 7 months that is the outcome of 3-4 am nightly hunger and cravings. I am now trying to fight the naps to sleep all night without waking up. It is difficult some days but it is better then having anxiety attacks."
