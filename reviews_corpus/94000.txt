"Everybody reacts differently to medications, especially those used to treat psychiatric disorders. Unfortunately for me, Trintellix caused major side effects, including a ridiculous amount of unfocusable energy that channeled itself into restless leg syndrome and extremely bad anxiety. Due to the energy and RLS, sleeping was very hard to do, and when I was able to get to sleep, I had the most unsettlingly terrifying dreams. For me, Trintellix was not a fun stop on my journey to find the correct medication(s) for me."
