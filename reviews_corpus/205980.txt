"I&#039;m 24 and have been taking Pristiq for about 6 weeks now. The first 3 weeks were hell. I went through horrible emotional spells. I would cry then get angry for no reason. I would just want to be left alone. My husband and my family were so worried about me. I wasn&#039;t myself at all, my mood changed so frequently. Now I am feeling balanced - I haven&#039;t had an anxiety attack for about 4 weeks now. I never thought I would get here. The only thing I am experiencing now is trouble sleeping but that&#039;s been going on a while, and a slight decrease in my sex drive. If that doesn&#039;t change in the next couple of weeks my doctor wants to put me on Wellbutrin, we&#039;ll see how that goes."
