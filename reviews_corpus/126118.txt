"Like most of you I have been on almost every medication to date. They work a few months and stop so I gave up about 8 yrs ago and just dealt with it all. I told my doctor I needed something for depression and anxiety. He put me on Viibryd and I slowly built my way up to 40 mg which I%u2019m still on to date.  This is the first medication that has ever worked for this long of a period for me.  And as far as being depressed that is long gone. I have a lot of trouble sleeping and when you do miss a dose you can expect a super crazy dream that night. I%u2019m a very moody person and they have seemed to control my outbursts and keep me calm. As for sexual side effects I have not noticed an increase or decrease. Have put on at least 10 extra lbs from it also. I%u2019m very satisfied with the results and would give this medicine a 10 star rating."
