"I had to stop taking Zelapar because I was having an operation. After a couple of days the operation was postponed and I forgot that I had stopped taking Zelapar. Anyway mid-day one afternoon I was having a horrible time because it seemed all movement had stopped, the next day the same, a couple of more days went by and I figured my good luck was up and it was time for either new medicines or a D.B.S. Then I remembered that I was not taking the Zelapar, well I went back to my daily dose and I am almost my old moving self. Thanks."
