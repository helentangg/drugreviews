"Been on 20mg a day for about 8 months now after trying several that did not agree with me. All seemed to be fine till two days ago, massive break down of suicidal thoughts. Began anti depressants after the deaths of mother and father 3 months apart. I think I was put on medication prematurely and think I was actually just starting the grieving process. After meds I never went through it, suddenly I&#039;m grieving and crying uncontrollably like I just lost them today. I will be weaning myself off the meds slowly."
