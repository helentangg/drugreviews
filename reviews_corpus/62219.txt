"First 2 days were euphoric and nothing could upset me. Then got more irritable and anxious. Stomach in knots. Then came depression &amp; thoughts of suicide along with anxiety. Yawning all the time. This is day 7 and I left a message with my doctor this morning letting her know I couldn&#039;t feel like this for another week in hopes that it would possibly even out."
