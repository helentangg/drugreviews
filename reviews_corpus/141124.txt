"While this is the first medication I&#039;ve been on it has made an exceptional positive impact on my life. The side effects are first for me a really unpleasant but they&#039;re totally worth working through because they did go away and it made everything in my life easier. My depression and anxiety are much better, sleeping better, eating better, motivation to get on with my life."
