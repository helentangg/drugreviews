"I take 20 mg of Celexa and 300 of Welbutrin. When I don&#039;t take them, I&#039;m much more irritable. I can still feel sadness and happiness, I just feel level somehow. If you stop cold turkey, it causes nausea, for me anyways, and i can tell I feel different off them. Still have some obsessive tendencies but overall, I wouldn&#039;t want to not take them."
