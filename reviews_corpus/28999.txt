"I am a 33 year old mother of 2 who was ready to give up on life.  Started taking 10mg of Lexapro and eventually increased to 20mg.  Have been taking for about a year and a half.  Although still dealing with a few side effects, (insomnia, weight gain, and waking up with headaches), Lexapro has truly saved my life.  I can now be the kind of mother and wife that my family deserves. "
