"I was hesitant to start on an antidepressant. However, while always prone to depression, the episodes had become more severe and lasted longer. I had terrible anxiety. Often even waking up in the middle of the night gasping for breath. Went on cymbalta. It took maybe 2 wks till I tentatively began to acknowledge that it might be working. Plus one evening I went downstairs to get ice for my neck (I had neck surgery last year) and realized I hadn&#039;t done that in weeks! Wasn&#039;t even taking It for pain. Ive  been on it for 3 mos now. I have experienced extreme fatigue like if I didn&#039;t have to get out of bed I could sleep for 12 hrs!  But that seems to be getting better. This drug has been subtle yet miraculous and improved my quality of life!"
