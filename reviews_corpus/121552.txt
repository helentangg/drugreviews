"I was on Effexor for over 10 yrs. I finally got off this in Dec. 2013 and as of today, July 2015, I&#039;m still having those brain zips several times a day. Last July, I started with a vibration and severe pain in my feet. It&#039;s all nerve connected and I think it&#039;s from long term use of Effexor. This medication works great for depression but the side effects are not worth it."
