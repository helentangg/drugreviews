"I started taking Prozac 4 weeks ago ... For symptoms of menopause ...... I can&#039;t take HRT as I&#039;ve had cancerous cells in my cervix which is why I had a hysterectomy .. Anyway I was having palpitations panic attacks stress and anxiety forgetting words very emotionally up and down .. I also suffer from PTS from a violent childhood .. I have to say I&#039;ve been so much happier and settled in my mind this is definitely working for me ."
