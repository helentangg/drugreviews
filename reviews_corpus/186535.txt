"I have been taking Pristiq since June 2009- almost 9 months.  I don&#039;t think I really had a clue at how depressed and anxious I was until I started on these medicines.  I remember going out on a boat and water skiing with no hesitations like the good old days! It was a beautiful thing! I was diagnosed with a rare auto immune disease and it literally consumed me from for two years. I would break down in doctors offices regularly, and started having panic attacks in the middle of the night and then finally during the day.   My side effects are on and off night sweats, and if I miss a pill I would have nausea and light-headedness, but otherwise sex is good!  It seems to work! Had weight loss = 5 lbs."
