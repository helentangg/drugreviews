"I&#039;m only 19 years old and I&#039;m taking nortriptyline to prevent my migraines . I get these bad migraines everyday and at times I feel like shaving my whole head off because I feel like it&#039;s my hair causing it but it&#039;s not . Well I&#039;ve been on nortripyline for 6 months now I still get migraines but not as bad as I use too but I still get them everyday which sucks . But I hate it because I&#039;m suppose to take it right before I go to sleep and when I do I can&#039;t sleep anymore like it wakes me up and then I&#039;m up the whole night and I start crying at times because I just want my migraines to go away so I could live a happy normal teenage life . I&#039;m on every day medication I take nortriplyine 10 mg and ibuprofen 600 mg It sucks I hope I get better soon"
