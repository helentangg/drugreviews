"I was on 75mg of Endep &amp; noticed 2 extreme side effects which lead to me having to stop taking the medication.
The first was rapid &amp; excessive weight gain; I gained 6 kgs (13 pounds) within 8 weeks (at 160cm, this is quite a bit of weight). I had no change in my diet, my exercise stayed the same, so the Endep was the only thing that could have caused the weight gain.
The second was extreme Night Terrors. These occurred every night &amp; were extremely frightening for myself &amp; family, as I would wake up screaming &amp; kicking every night. This occurred almost immediately after starting the Endep.
Since stopping the Endep 2 weeks ago, the Night Terrors have ceased completely, &amp; I have lost 1kg with no change in diet."
