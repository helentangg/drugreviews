"I&#039;ve been on zoloft for about a year, at 25mg. But I&#039;ve recently developed panic disorder can&#039;t seem to handle the side effects of going up. 
I believe I&#039;m not even at the optimal dose yet.
My doc perscribed me effexor XR and I&#039;m on day one of taking that and I feel completely emotionless.
I&#039;m going back go zoloft tomorrow because initially it worked for depression  and anxiety.
Everyone is different, but I&#039;ve tried citalopram, etsicitalopram, and now effexor and they all make me feel numb and like a zombie. 
Zoloft all the way.
My doc won&#039;t prescribe me benzos and I feel that zoloft will be great with xanax! Going back to the doctors next week to tell them to shove the effexor and I&#039;m staying in zoloft."
