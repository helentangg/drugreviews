"I have suffered from all kinds of anxieties, like Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Attacks, Obsessive thoughts and Social anxiety. There are times when you have NO social anxiety, for instance, in my case, even after stopping 25mg CR version Paxil, there had been no fear of social confrontation, just shyness or may be low self-esteem or introversion.

But when SA attacks again, its a very gradual process. Even if you notice a slight sign of SA coming back, you try to disprove your own opinion by thinking - &#039;&#039;Now I have learned, this feeling is just stupid, doesn&#039;t make sense and I am definitely not gonna develop a full fledged SA.&quot;
But when SA comes back you have no idea but to start taking Paxil again."
