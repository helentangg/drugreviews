"I&#039;m 17, and I&#039;ve been on Celexa for roughly 2 months now, and its fantastic! I went from a depressed/suicidal teen to a happy outgoing person. I have my life back, I&#039;ve never felt this good in a long time. I have struggled most of my teen years with depression, eating disorder and severe OCD, and now I am free to live my own life. My obsessions and compulsions have gone away, and I am far from depressed, I feel more normal then I have ever been. It took about 4 weeks to finally start working, I started at 10mg and now I&#039;m at 20mg, works great and no side effects besides slight headaches occasionally and crazy vivid dreams."
