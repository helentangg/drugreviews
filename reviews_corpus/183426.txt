"For the last 2 years I have suffered massive panic and anxiety attacks. I thought my world as I knew it was over.
Thanks to Cymbalta everything is almost back to normal and I am feeling myself again. I started taking it 2 months ago, the first 2 weeks I had a bit of nausea but now its gone. No other side effects."
