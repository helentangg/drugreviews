"I took this 10 years ago to help with depression and anxiety through a divorce in 2006. It helped... I got better.... I stopped taking it.  This year has been difficult and after car accident I am nervous,  anxious and very irritable along with depression and  hopelessness.  I just started taking again with just 10mg and can already tell a difference.. However due to no sleep Dr put me on a sleeping pill as well so I can&#039;t tell if the Lexapro is adding to the sleep aid for my sleeping."
