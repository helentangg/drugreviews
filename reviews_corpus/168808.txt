"I am a 28 year old male. I was diagnosed with High Functioning Autism (Asperger&#039;s) when I was 19 and a couple years later with Treatment Resistant Unipolar Major Depressive Disorder. I&#039;ve lost several jobs and did poorly in school due to severe social anxiety, and poor attendance. I always wanted to be alone and just sit in my room. I had a couple suicide attempts when I was younger. 

After trying many antidepressants my psychiatrist tried me on Viibryd. I began feeling better at the beginning of the 3rd week of treatment and soon my depression was almost nonexistent. I do have several odd side effects: Diarrhea, Dilated Pupils, Brain Zaps, twitching/talking in sleep, etc. But I am still better off than before."
