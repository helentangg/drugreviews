"I&#039;ve been taking 50mg for 4 weeks now. It does work but it has dulled a lot of my emotions and many things I used to enjoy, I now find boring. I still have some anxiety but it has definitely made me calmer.  

Also my sex drive is dead! I&#039;m a 23 yo male and my previously high sex drive is gone! I also find it super hard to climax. I&#039;m going to see a doctor about augmenting Zoloft with Wellbutin to counter this effect. 

This medication is worth a shot but the sexual side effects and boredom are very troubling for me."
