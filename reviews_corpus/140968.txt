"I have been a heavy drinker in the past, and decided to completely quit drinking about 6 weeks ago for a variety of reasons. I had never really been depressed up to this point, but maybe I was dealing with my depression through drinking all along. I digress. I slid into a depression. I could not put one foot in front of the other. Work performance, sex life, hobbies, and social skills all seemed to suffer. My family and friends (some pharmacists and nurses) urged me to try an SSRI and see if it made a difference. They assured me that depression was common in early sobriety and that I may need a boost to get back to living a fulfilling life. I was prescribed Lexapro 10mg 2 weeks ago and I can already tell the difference. Everyday gets better"
