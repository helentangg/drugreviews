"I&#039;ve been taking Paxil 20 mg since 2003, I&#039;ve tried to wean off of it, but why?  I noticed on Paxil, I am happier, I don&#039;t worry as much, I don&#039;t get anxiety, no panic attacks.  Yes you will have terrible side effects weaning off and even after the fact, like I did.  But we must keep in mind why we started taking it in the first place.  So take it from me, stay on them if you need them, just because you are feeling great and back to your happy self doesn&#039;t mean you need to get off of this wonderful medication.  Good Luck...."
