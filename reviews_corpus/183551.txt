"I&#039;ve been on Cymbalta for about 13 months but after reading many of the posts, I&#039;m thinking I should add this little self-evaluation.  I was diagnosed with autism, dyslexia and hyper-activity in the mid-1960&#039;s when research was still in its infancy. Anxiety was a continuous battle and after failing the 4th grade, all I remember was being in a fog. Cymbalta has cut through the anxiety even though the autism and dyslexia are hard-wired as part of my disorder.  I was recently pushed to 60 mg with improvement from my 30 mg dose.  As part of anxiety, you can feel the adrenaline flowing through you at the slightest distraction or obstacle, but Cymbalta has done miracles to cut the amount of adrenaline released.  Coffee puts me to sleep."
