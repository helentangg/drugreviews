"After reading about others&#039; experiences with Cymbalta, I was very hesitant to try it. However, I got to a point where I was willing to do anything to feel &#039;normal&#039; again. I started Cymbalta (30mg) about 3 months ago and I am SO glad I did. The first week was unpleasant -- I was close to stopping it, but my family encouraged me to give it a fair shot. By the second week things were better. Now (still on 30mg) the only side effects that remain are loss of appetite (causing weight loss), occasional vivid dreams, and some difficulty with orgasm. For me the benefits have been huge -- I am able to focus, more energy, no more racing thoughts, no more crying spells, and no more anxiety/panic. Everyone is different, but for me this has worked great!"
