"I wanted to share my experience with Prozac for those that are perhaps just starting out, letting them know, that it does in fact, get much better. I have had pretty bad anxiety since childhood and also the symptoms of PMDD for a few years now also.  To the point that I would schedule events around when I was going to have PMS, because it made me so unable to deal with anything at all.  I was snapping at people, got easily frustrated with my children, and would feel very down on myself in general.

Since going on Prozac approximately 7 weeks ago, I went through a very anxious phase, but the last two weeks have been amazing. I have never felt this happy or calm. I am on 30mg, with no plans to stop."
