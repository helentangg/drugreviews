"I was one of those people who thought nothing would work for me - I was too far gone and beyond help.   Restless, sleepless nights and all the anxiety and depression were killing me.  And then I found Amitriptyline.    At last.....Sleep.   That&#039;s all that mattered to begin with.  You simply cannot underestimate the power of sleep.  During the day I felt far less agitated and less stressed.  Of course life can still throw slings and arrows your way and there are side effects for sure but none as bad as the frazzled state I was in before I took them."
