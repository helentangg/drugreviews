"So far so good!  I&#039;m currently on 150mg Wellbutrin XL, and was just on 5mg of lexepro for the past 9 months. I could not tolerate the side effects at 10mg (extreme hunger all the time, burping all day, gaining weigh rapidly even when combined with the WB XL). 5mg was not enough serotonin for me and I&#039;ve tried all the SSRIs (except Celexa bc my pDoc said its the same/dirtier version of lexepro) and can&#039;t do any of them b/c of the GI side effects.  I was about to try another SNRI but then asked him to at least try celexa once to make sure I can&#039;t do it. Well, I&#039;m on day 5 of 20mg and I&#039;m not having the same hunger issues at all! Some burping on day 3 and 4 but none today. Hoping this is the ticket. :) So frustrated with years of med trials!"
