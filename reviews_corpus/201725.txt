"I was addicted to opiates for years and when I went to treatment and came off of them was diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorders. Zoloft has really helped with anxiety and depression. No urges to abuse opiates, a general good mood (it&#039;s not a euphoric thing, just a normal human feeling). Only when I began taking it did I have side effects, and they were very mild. I felt overstimulated for a day or two and maybe had a few heart flutter feelings but after a few days no side effects and after a week or two no depression."
