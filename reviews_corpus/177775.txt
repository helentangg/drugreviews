"I was quick to anger, severe mood swings would yell at my kids for the slightest things. I was ready to punch anybody that would make me mad and( it didn&#039;t take much!) I started with Cymbalta 30mg and I noticed a slight difference I was increased to 60 mg and I felt the change right away. I&#039;m so calm and I&#039;m back to being a happy mom. I take it at night because it would get me sleepy during the day if I take in the morning some of the side effects I&#039;ve experienced have been dry mouth, lack of appetite, hot flashes, tiredness! I love this medicine it has changed my life. The relationship with my children is much much better too. I no longer have crying spells and I&#039;m a much nicer person. Try Cymbalta."
