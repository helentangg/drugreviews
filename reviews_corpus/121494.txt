"Coming off of it is one of the worst things I&#039;ve gone through. I wish I could go back in time and never start using it. I&#039;ve recently decided medication isn&#039;t the right path for me. I was on Celexa before this. When I missed a day on Celexa I could deal with the pain but when I miss a dose of Effexor I feel awful for at least the next two days. This led me to the decision to come off of it and I&#039;m almost ready to go back on just to make the withdrawals stop. My doctor always tried to encourage me to go up to the 100s as well and I was headstrong about staying on the 75mg. I&#039;m glad I chose to stay that low as I can&#039;t imagine trying to come off anything higher. I would not recommend taking this medication."
