"Wish I could rate this poisonous chemical a minus ZERO... got free samples for 6 weeks at 5mg I&#039;ve missed so much work trying to adjust to flu like symptoms, leg cramps, diarrhea, more depressed, the pharmaceutical rep told my doctor he himself was on it imagine that just to push this medication onto lab rats such as myself. I&#039;m now trying to connect with a with drawl specialist waiting for a call back as I&#039;ve tried to cut the pill in 3 sections and within an hour I&#039;m vomiting, I&#039;m dehydrated, and reporting this medication to the FDA and any other agency that will take this seriously my primary only a DO and has no experience in anti depressants he just passed along samples talked into by his drug rep I HATE what this med has done to me"
