"I have been taking Brisdelle for two weeks now, but had to stop taking it due to the unacceptable side effects.  It worked like a charm on my hot flashes, reducing them from at least 12-15 times in a 24 hour period (with night sweats) to only 1 per day.  However, I found it impossible to sleep, I could not keep my hands and feet still, I had congestion so bad that I thought I had a sinus infection and also suffered blurred vision.  I tried taking it in the morning instead of at night, but it made no difference to my insomnia.  I have, therefore, discontinued it altogether."
