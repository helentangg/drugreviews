"This medication changed my life.  I&#039;m sorry I waited so long to admit I needed it.  It&#039;s wonderful to be able to cope with all of the daily challenges of life and yet still feel happy to be alive.  If you&#039;re feeling out of control, don&#039;t waste your life out of fear of asking for help.  Side effects like loss of sexual drive are minor compared to the benefits."
