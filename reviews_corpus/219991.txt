"I struggled horribly with severe anxiety for years I tried all kinds of natural remedies and doctor prescribed medicines but nothing worked long term then two years ago I was diagnosed with interstitial cystitis and was prescribed AmItriptyline  for pain but what I got was amazing relief from my anxiety and stress now I know what people mean when they say &quot;I got my life back&quot; I take 5mg before bed I sleep great and have a little trouble waking up cause I sleep so well but once I&#039;m up I&#039;m fine no drowsiness and no more anxiety"
