"I was on Zoloft for a few years as I have generalized anxiety disorder. I am also somewhat ADD and suffer from chronic insomnia but no depression.  It helped but I got a new doctor and we decided to try Wellbutrin and vyvance respectively to treat the ADD. Wellbutrin actually made me depressed and the vyvance did wonders for the ADD but horrible for anxiety. E
We then tried Effexor. Not the one. I went back begging for my Zoloft and a clonazepam at night. By far the best drug for me. It does take a couple of weeks before it calms me down enough to sleep.  Being back on it feels like coming home again!"
