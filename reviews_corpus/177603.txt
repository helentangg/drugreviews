"Prescribed 30 mg/ daily for fibromyalgia pain. Kudos to those who this helps. The side effects and reaction were too much to handle. Chemical taste in mouth, dry mouth, sore throat, badly increased pain and onset of new pains that haven&#039;t subsided, trembling, migraine, intestinal cramps, vertigo, severe stoned feeling, inability to think, everything seemed &quot;slow motion,&quot; and I had to concentrate hard to do simple tasks.  Also felt like I was in a free fall. Effects lasted two days after stopping, and the new pains haven&#039;t stopped. Not recommended if hypersensitive to medicine."
