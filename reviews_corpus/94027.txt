"My Doctor gave me Trintellex recently for MDD And Anxiery Disorder.  I was on viibyrd on and off for 3 yrs and it was not working for me anymore.  I started Trintellex at 5mg for 7 days and now on 10 mgs, Day 5.  I&#039;m not crying anymore, my anxiety level is almost nothing and I feel happier.  The only side effects I got was nauseated after taking the medicine for about an hour and itchy.  I had to take a benedryl.   These pass after about two weeks.  I do not feel clouded like most other ssri make you feel or tired.  I just feel normal!  I think this is a great Medication."
