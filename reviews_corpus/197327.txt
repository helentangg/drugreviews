"My general doctor gave me Paxil when I told her I had been having panic attacks and anxiety. I started on 10mg and when I hadn&#039;t noticed a difference after 6 weeks she upped the dose to 20mg. I still have anxiety day to day, and feel the beginning of a panic attack a lot, but am not able to go through with it. Sex drive completely gone. All I want to do is sleep. Depression worsened. This is not for me."
