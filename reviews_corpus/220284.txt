"I have been suffering from migraine from last 40 years. I used to be almost paralyzed by it everyday. My life suffered in many ways so much that I could not do many things. About 27 yrs before my College Neurologist prescribed me 10 mg amitriptyline every night and next day I would not get migraine. It was nothing less than a miracle. The side effects were also bad as last 27 yrs I fall in sleep in all those awkward places like Movie theater, While in class but I did not stop as at least I did not have migraine. No one would know the extent of migraine unless or until he/she had a first hand experience. My mouth is always dry but I will take the side effects over migraine."
