"This was my miracle medicine for the most part- little to no effect on sex drive, helped with depression AND anxiety/OCD that gave me some much needed pep. However, Viibryd did have some pretty gnarly side effects for me that necessitated by cessation of usage. It started within the first month as night terrors (extremely realistic dreams that are almost lucid in that you are aware that you are asleep but you can&#039;t wake yourself up or even you awake but can&#039;t move) and night sweats, both of which I can handle, given the positive effect the medicine had on me overall.  Eventually though I began developing parathesia (electric shock sensations) that got so serious they would cause minor convulsions almost daily."
