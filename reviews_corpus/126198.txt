"I have been on Zoloft for almost 4 years with the exception of pregnancy and it seems to do just fine, but after having my daughter life got ridiculous. After moving around 6 different times in 4 1/2 months it stopped helping, so a few weeks ago my doctor put me on Viibryd. The first 2 weeks I had diarrhea then severe nausea and now finishing my first week of 40mg I&#039;m having the craziest dreams and when I don&#039;t dream I feel unconscious and no where near rested while still having nausea. I really hope it gets better."
