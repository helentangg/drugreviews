"I am a 43 year old, otherwise healthy male, with reactive depression due to extreme financial stress over the last 2 years. Couldn&#039;t stop obsessive, negative thoughts, to the point I was nearly at breaking point. Was placed on 10mg Lexapro for one week, and then increased to 20mg. Initial side effects were sweating, and insomnia. The sweating passes quickly, and the insomnia has now all but disappeared. The first week, my anxiety and depression may actually have increased, but after that, had steady improvement, until after 6 weeks, felt completely back to my old self. The only ongoing side effect is difficulty achieving orgasm, but I am completely prepared to live with that, considering how I was feeling beforehand. Has been a lifesaver."
