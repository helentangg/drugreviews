"I have taken anti-depressants since the age of 40. This one helps a lot in my thoughts of suicide. I was very suicidal a couple of weeks ago and this med has help quite down the thoughts of suicide to a point where I can consider treatment for my depression. This med is helping me to ignore the voices in my head that tell me to kill myself.

The only side effect I have is insomnia.   I can live with that."
