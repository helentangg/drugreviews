"This drug is awful. I started taking it for depression over 11 years ago and I&#039;ve been on doses 75 mg up to 300mg. I&#039;m currently taking 150mg and I&#039;m so addicted. I&#039;ve tried so many times to get off the drug and can&#039;t go longer than that third day. It will make u sick and crazy. My advice to anyone is never start it. It may as well be classified like painkillers and other addictive drugs. Please do not start this medication. Oh and btw I&#039;m still very much depressed!!"
