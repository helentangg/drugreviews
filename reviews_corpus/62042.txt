"I had to quit smoking, and was deep in the throes of everything mental. Called my doctor, and he prescribed Celexa...one-half pill (20 mg). I was furious! Half a pill? They either didn&#039;t have any idea what I was dealing with, or didn&#039;t care.  I griped, but I started that night, with my little `1/2 pill. The next day I didn&#039;t even think about a cigarette until I realized I hadn&#039;t thought about them! 
I love Celexa."
