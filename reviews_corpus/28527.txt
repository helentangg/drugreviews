"I was diagnosed with major depression and anxiety. I had crippling depression, could not sleep, eat, get out of bed or interact with anyone.  I cried uncontrollably and did not know why and if that was not enough I was having frequent panic attacks (more than one per day). My PDoc tried several meds and Lexapro 20mg is the best.  I also take Clonazapam 0.5 mg, and Wellbutrin 10mg for sexual side effects.  For the first time in my life I feel normal, having never felt this way before.  I do not like the sexual side effects so that is why my doc prescribed Welbutrin. It doesn&#039;t seem to make any difference.  I am drowsy and forgetful and lack motivation. I will ask my doc if a withdrawal from Wellbutrin or Clonazepam will will help."
