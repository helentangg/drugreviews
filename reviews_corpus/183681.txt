"I took Cymbalta for about 6 months for clinical depression. Although it helped the depression a lot, I couldn&#039;t stand the side effects. I lost about 20 lbs (I&#039;m already underweight), I started having almost constant migraines, and all I wanted to do was sleep.  It was hard to get through work because I was so tired.  Then on my days off, I would only wake up to make dinner for my husband, then I&#039;d be back in bed."
