"People either love Effexor or hate it.  I am on the side of adoration. I am 18 years old and have been taking Effexor for 4 years and the change I experienced was amazing.  I have a long family history of depression and a generalized anxiety disorder, and it doesn&#039;t help when you&#039;re trying to go through puberty and are constantly being told that everybody your age is going through the same thing.  The side effects are not pleasant, I used to get headaches, my blood pressure increased (but with exercise it can be managed), and get lightheaded and faint more often.  Even with these, I still am happy and am grateful for Effexor."
