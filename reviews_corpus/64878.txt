"I have suffered from OCD for over a decade and it has taken over my life.  I&#039;ve been on zoloft for three months and am seeing progress.
It has helped mildly with the anxiety.  I am finding that my life choices are changing.  I am eating healthier, going outside more, taking up new hobbies, reconnecting with old friends, maintaining a healthier relationship with my family members, my anger has decreased significantly and I am not ruminating on repetitive thoughts quite as often.

This medication is very helpful for getting on the road to recovery.  I am using it in conjunction with meditation and mindfulness therapy.

The only drawback is that it gives me diarrhea and short term memory loss.  I have been using post it notes."
