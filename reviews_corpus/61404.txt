"I have been on a lot of psychotropic drugs through the years.  I hated them all.  This was the first drug that relieved my anxiety and my mind doesn&#039;t work as fast so I can actually focus on something and read without all the inner dialogue in my head.  When I am trying to read something, my mind takes off on tangents and I am still reading but I am not comprehending.  It&#039;s nice to be able to focus on something and really take in the information.  I don&#039;t feel like I&#039;m in such a hurry all the time.  I personally didn&#039;t have ANY problem with my libido or with my orgasms.  For men, it&#039;s good you can last longer when taking this medication;)  My boyfriend takes it also."
