"After a hospitalisation where no net good came about, I changed psychiatrist. The new guy is semi-retired, only works two half days a week - but is extremely familiar with MAOIs and one of the few doctors in a state of 4 million that will prescribe them. My symptoms were more refractory and atypical depression, and it&#039;s been quite a journey to try and work something out.

I&#039;ve been on tranylcypromine for 3 months now. As it&#039;s an analog of amphetamine, my major side effects have been similar to amphetamine - sleeplessness (3 hours a night), hyper alertness, agitation when the dose wears off (sucks as it&#039;s only 3 hours or so) and when really worn out it keeps going and I feel alert but make judgement errors. Depression is gone though!"
