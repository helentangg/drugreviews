"I started on Zoloft due to a number of losses-deaths in family &amp; a breakup. While they say it may take weeks to fully enter your system, I would say for me it took a few days to feel it. Mine was a lower dosage, 25mg I believe but it still worked well enough to jump-start my life again. I would no longer dwell on the negative things, however sometimes it was equally hard to concentrate on important things, as my mind would go &quot;spacy&quot; on occasion. Slight dry mouth at first but it went away. I became more social and dated more. The downside- while interest in sex never waned, it would take a long time to perform. You would THINK that would be a good thing, but after 20 minutes, most ladies started glancing at the clock. So much for dating!"
