"I started Effexor XR (generic version) about 3 weeks ago. I will admit, the bottle sat on my counter for a week before I took my first one, because the negative reviews terrified me. I finally took one and I am so glad I did! I have been on practically every anxiety/ depression med there is and had kind of lost hope with them working. I have also tried several different natural methods and they helped a little bit, but not nearly enough. I struggle mainly with anxiety and have for about 15 years now. By day 3, I had already noticed a difference. It&#039;s been 3 weeks &amp; not only is my anxiety significantly better, I no longer have swollen joints or numbness in my hands &amp; feet, I&#039;m so much happier &amp; way less stressed. Life changing!!"
