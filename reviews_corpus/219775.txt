"I have troubles with Anxiety and insomnia for years I&#039;ve been on different types of medicine and some of them helped but I just went to my doctor On 8/15 and He put me on Amitripyline 50 mg so I take that night and I must say that&#039;s the best sleep I&#039;ve had in a long time , I woke up feeling good I had plenty of energy and my mood was totally different I have 28 employees and sometimes it can be VERY stressful but I went to work feeling GREAT and I&#039;ve only took 1 pill so far !!!! I&#039;m looking forward to a new me since ❤️"
