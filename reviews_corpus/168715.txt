"Was on for 3 weeks, 10mg, until the nightmares and sleep got so bad I had to stop.  Was so bad I was having to take upwards of 1.5mg of Klonopin just to sleep and still didn&#039;t seem to help at all.  Seemed to help with anxiety but the affects on my sleep were counteracting any help it was having for the anxiety.  I&#039;ve always had issues with my sleep but this definitely made them worse.  Seriously the nightmares were intense and strange.  Like dreams within dreams, gory sometimes, but almost always sad and frustrating.  Might be the ticket for others, but not me.  On lamictal now and seem to be doing much better (after 2 year trials of all kinds of SSRI&#039;s and SNRIs that only helped a little in some ways or totally messed me up)."
