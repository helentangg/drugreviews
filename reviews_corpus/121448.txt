"I&#039;ve been taking this for about 5 years and it has helped with stress and depression, though more so for stress. I started taking Wellbutrin about 8 months ago as well due to depression getting worse, and the combination has helped tremendously. I have had &quot;brain zaps&quot; when I haven&#039;t taken my morning dose by about noon the following day, and have been out for a few days so they were even worse, but I feel the benefits outweigh that. While one side effect can be constipation, venlafaxine has actually helped as I used to have the opposite problem. Overall I think both mess are great."
