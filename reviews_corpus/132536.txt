"Has many years of  problems with depression, anxiety , derealization etc. Eventually learned these all related to Complex Multiple Trauma. But that is another story. Doxepin pretty much the ONLY antidepressant that has ever helped me. Totally a life saver over and over for me. 

It is HIGHLY calming as well as anti-deprssing. That is because  simultaneous to increasing serotonin and norepinephrine,  is a beta adrenergic blocker (hence anti fear etc)

BUT here is the real amazing thing about Doxepin - it is VERY anti- inflammatory. Neuroinflammation (brain inflammation) is a big issue  in mental health problems. Doxepin - out if ALL dregs, addresses this best of all. Search pub med. Doxepin has saved my life many times over several decades."
