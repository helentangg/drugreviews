"I took Pristiq for extreme generalized anxiety disorder.  I went off 5 weeks ago because I was feeling so well after taking it for several years and I just had to go back on 4 days ago.  This medicine works very quickly.  I could barely get out of bed on Friday and I was back to work Monday, functioning and feeling much better.  Pristiq does not take my anxiety away 100% all the time but it keeps me functioning.  Without this medicine I am not sure what I would do."
