"Zoloft is amazing for me. Was prescribed it years ago when suffering post natal and it was a life saver. On it for about a year.  I started it again (50mg) 2 years ago as I was suffering stress when my son was diagnosed with autism. Since the drug became effective (within a month), I could see how wonderful my life actually was and was able to support my son who went on to do really well. But I put on 9 kg so I&#039;ve just weaned off it and am exhausted and not coping well with stress. Think I weaned too quickly (3/4 weeks) so am going to try taking 25 mg and see if that still helps but hopefully without the weight gain. If u r depressed or anxious try this drug it is so effective with hardly any side effects. Just bit hard to go off it!!"
