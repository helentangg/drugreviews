"In my late 20s on 10 mg a day - 7 days using the medication
I&#039;ve been experiencing anxiety for some years now. With citalopram, I can finally make eye contact without feeling awkward. I would go to my college counselor for a simple evaluation on my grades and I would begin to sweat, then I&#039;d walk out the office feeling embarrassed, asking myself, &quot;why did you get so nervous?!&quot; Nothing seems to irritate me as much, problems just roll off my back. I tried provoking myself into becoming worried by thinking about upcoming events that involve social situations, but my mind doesn&#039;t allow me to panic. Its like my head boxes the &quot;uneasiness&quot;! Now I&#039;m anxious to go to school to learn, ask questions, socialize with worrying what people think about me!"
