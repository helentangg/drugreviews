"I am 28 and have fibromylagia and joint disease. I don&#039;t have a sex drive anyway so I did not notice any difference with Pristiq on that side effect. I did how ever notice that I no longer woke up feeling 88, but 28 again. The pain and soreness went away dramatically! I have been able to clean more and walk more, but I have not noticed a big change in energy level. Just to have a day without soreness and stiffness was worth it for me. I do have a little dry mouth, but I drink a lot of water anyway. As far as sleep goes- I occasionally had insomnia before, but it does make it a little worse and I had night sweats for the first week on it."
