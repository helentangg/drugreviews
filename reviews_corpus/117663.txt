"I was prescribed this medication because my migraines were increasing and my sleep was getting very erratic. Since taking this medication for the past month, I have slept throught the night and it is easy for me to fall back asleep if I wake up to use the bathroom. I am so glad my doctor suggested this. After 13+ years of bad sleep and increase of migraines, I think I found something that works without any side effects (thus far). I take about 1 hour before bed and it has worked like a charm."
