"It is a LIFE SAVER. Since I started the medication, I never had anxiety again. I can drive whenever I want and I can do things that I would avoid before the medication. I really recommend this medicine. I think that it does a lot of good things. My mom has also had a really good experience with it as well. I am on 10mg and I haven&#039;t had to change yet. I am also prescribed Xanax for the anxiety, but I never take it because the anxiety seems to have disappeared. I gave the medicine a 9 because I have NO sex drive since I started taking Lexapro. I don&#039;t like it, but I&#039;ll take no sex drive over being miserable. Good luck!"
