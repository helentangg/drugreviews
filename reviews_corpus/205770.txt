"I have been on this medication for about 2 months now. Started this medication for depression and had the pleasant side effect of appetite suppression for me. I didn&#039;t notice anything during the first month of use but during this second month I have noticed not being as hungry as well as eating smaller portions. I have also lost 10lbs in the last month and have more energy. I have had no major side effects but do have an occasional headache but Tylenol generally helps that!"
