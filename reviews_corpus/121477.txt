"New to this generic brand, venlafaxine xr 150mg capsule, pharmacy has new distributer.  Easier to swallow capsule,  (it&#039;s only been 2 weeks).   The first time taking it, I opened capsule in food like I&#039;ve always done, BUT BAD REACTION!  Had to call in sick to work, It was like I was DRUNK!.  I do not drink alcohol at all.   Other problem I&#039;m sleeping all the time at home, very annoying, not Getting anything done.  Work is fine. Is this usual?  Hope this helps, I did tell my Pharmacist, to help out other customers."
