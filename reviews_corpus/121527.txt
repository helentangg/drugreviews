"I&#039;ve tried Citalopram and Cymbalta and they don&#039;t work for me. Citalopram makes me loopy all day and not able to think. Cymbalta just does nothing period. Effexor works well for both my anxiety and depression and racing thoughts. I can now think more clearly and not clench my jaw so much anymore. I&#039;m taking 75mg dosage."
