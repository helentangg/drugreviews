"I began sertraline 50 mg approximately four weeks ago. I wasn%u2019t sure weather to take it at night or in the morning so I experimented with both. I found that during the day I would become very lethargic and yawn constantly with little energy but would then wake up in the middle of the night stimulated regardless of the time I took it. This frustrated me as I have always had a good sleep schedule and am an active person during the day, but I had read that others had experienced similar side effects and the effects eventually ceased. I felt better for several days%u2014not as downcast, brooding, heavy. 

After three weeks of taking it, the effect seemed to even out and I found myself struggling with feelings of hopelessness and doubt again. I felt better, certainly, just still struggling%u2014I don&#039;t expect a pill to %u201Ccure%u201D me of negative thoughts. I know I have control over my own thoughts, but it was that feeling of heaviness that tends to settle upon me%u2014like a dark cloud. When I went back to my doctor for the follow up, he increased it to 100 mg. I said let%u2019s try 75 mg first. He agreed. 

Within a couple weeks of taking 75 mg I still yawned a lot but I wasn%u2019t having trouble with lethargy and sleep issues as much. My attitude was much better. For example, I found that I really am a funny and silly person! I forgot that I was funny being under depression. I didn%u2019t realize how serious I had become, how reclusive. I also found my creativity really opened up. I had forgotten how creative I was. I also have been going to the gym and eating well. I try and smile and interact with people more%u2014even if I don%u2019t feel like it. I may just greet people or hold the door for them but it%u2019s better than me avoiding people like I used to. Some days are harder than others, but I can say that overall my experience with sertraline has been positive."
