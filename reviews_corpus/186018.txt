"What they didn&#039;t tell me is how dependent you get on it. It started off I could miss a few days and not feel anything. Then I would feel it if I missed one or 2 days but I would just be a little more down. Now if I miss a day I can&#039;t function and if I miss 2 it gets really scary. It&#039;s only happened once or twice while I&#039;ve been on it but by the second or third day missed I am not myself. I&#039;m anxious, my jaw hurts, I can&#039;t sleep, crying fits are common, vomiting and headaches are constant. During this time there are stages that are worse than other but &#039;brain zaps&#039; and dizziness are common. I&#039;ve also seen and heard things and overall it feels like you are high and is the most awful thing I&#039;ve ever experienced. It&#039;s made the med not worth it."
