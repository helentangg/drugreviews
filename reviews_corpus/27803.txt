"I had been on Lexapro 20mg for years and was tired of the weight gain and thought I was okay enough to be off of it.  Weaned myself off of it over a long time and went through all of the brain zaps, confusion, exhaustion, etc.  But, finally I was off it.  I was starting to get depressed again and not very clear thoughts but I thought I could handle it.  Then, I got the flu and was on Tamiflu (never again) and all of the depression and anxiety raised its ugly head again. Could not shake it.  The horrible thoughts, depression, hopelessness, insomnia, etc. I started a week ago back on Lexapro 5mg and already feel much better.  I am starting to get more tired during the day but I do not care.  I may bump up to 10mg. If you need it, you need it."
