"Just started Celexa, and already I noticed the more feeling of calm, and calm is not something I think I&#039;ve ever been, I get angered easy, upset, cry, feel overwhelmed, hopeless, feel better off dead, mood always up and down because of how many losses I have had in my life, feeling like a failure, you name it, I really hope this helps me long term. I&#039;ve noticed a difference already and am optimistic."
