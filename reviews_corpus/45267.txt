"I have been having SEVERE hot flashes for about a year, mild ones for a year before that.   I can&#039;t take the normal meds due to high risk of breast cancer so my PCP put me on Prozac. I thought to myself there was no way it would help but after 2 days I noticed a big difference, and after 5 days they are nearly gone, I&#039;m on 10 mg D.  I take it in the morning."
