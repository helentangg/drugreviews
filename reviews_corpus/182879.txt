"I have severe anxiety depression. I&#039;ve tried all the meds out, as my doctor would say.  Cymblatla was suggested. And me needing to feel normal tried it. Worst experience of my life.  Was on 40mg. Felt like I was having an out of body experience, like someone was pulling me, everywhere. Dr told to stick with it, and lower dose (I actually did, did not recommend talk to Dr first). Nothing changed. I was talking without thinking, having more and more panic attacks and higher anxiety. Absolutely zero libido, and I gained weight. I felt &quot;happy&quot;, but a weird happy.
So, finally I TELL my doctor for the third time in 9 months, I want off this medication. Withdrawl symptoms no joke. 
It&#039;s been a month and I still have w.d effects"
