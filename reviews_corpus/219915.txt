"I have a depressive disorder called disthymia, post traumatic stress disorder and have been struggling with sleep/insomnia for a while.
I was on zopiclone and tamazepam often put could only take them 3 days at a time with a break as to not become addicted to them etc.

After a few months of this my doctor gave me Amitriptyline and it also boosts my anti depressant. I have a couple of pills at about 8 or so and its been great.
I fall asleep at the right times - start yawning around 11pm, jump into bed and get to sleep. I wake up about 7 or 8 and im able to get up.

It has also been great for my moods. I love it"
