"25 years of Panic, Agoraphobia, Anxiety, PTSD, Depression, OCD. Have tried Zoloft, Luvox, Lexapro and Anafranil. Citalopram has unsurpassed efficacy for the aforementioned conditions. Quite simply the best SSRI. Panic literally disappeared, anxiety decimated, depression lifted. Also getting relief from OCD symptoms. Zero side effects. Titrated off Wellbutrin which exacerbated my anxiety. Highly Recommend, outstanding medication."
