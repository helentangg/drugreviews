"This drug is not for me. Not only did I have bad dreams and hallucinations, it seriously affected my memory. The four months I took it I didn&#039;t think anything was wrong. My family had to tell me how goofy (but funny and nice) I was acting...very weird, I&#039;m not that nice.  Still waiting for those 4 months of memory to return. Also, my doctor had prescribed Chantix to stop smoking at the same time. Probably the combination put me in the land of Oz. Went back to taking Remeron and trying to stop smoking naturally. Hope either medicine works great for you though."
