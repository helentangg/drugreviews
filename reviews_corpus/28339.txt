"After being diagnosed with depression and generalized anxiety disorder, my doctor prescribed me Lexapro. I was very skeptical.  I finally took it after having a few days with me debating whether or not to take it. It made me feel a lot better. I&#039;m only a few days into it but I can feel a difference. I&#039;m a little dizzy and find myself yawning when I first take my dose of 10mg, but that usually goes away. I also had to use the restroom several times, but overall not a lot of side effects. I&#039;m surprised and pleased so far and I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll have to up my dose in a few months."
