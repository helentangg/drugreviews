"I&#039;ve suffered from generalized anxiety since I was a child, but only recently decided to do something about it. After having annoying side effects with Zoloft, I switched to Paxil. The first week really brought out my anxiety symptoms, and I wasn&#039;t able to get a good night&#039;s rest for well over a month, but it&#039;s really developed into a miracle drug for me. My only side effect is occasional chattering teeth, but it&#039;s a small price to pay for feeling great. My only regret is not trying this years ago."
