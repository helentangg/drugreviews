"I&#039;ve suffered with this thing for years and been on citalopram for two 6 month periods.  It dulls everything down, squashes the dynamics.  So yes it helps with fending off panic attacks a bit, although not at first, but it turns me into someone else; a lack lustre drone.  I&#039;ve found it better to have the dynamics back and deal with the panic attacks in different ways.  It deals with symptoms, not root causes.  Citalopram exacerbates my feelings of worthlessness that cause the attacks in the first place! I don&#039;t find panicless dullness to be of much help in the long run, but it can help short-term.  Depression and anxiety has a cause drugs can&#039;t deal with. It only fends of symptoms."
