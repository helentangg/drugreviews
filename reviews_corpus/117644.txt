"10 mg at night for chronic tension headaches. The first few days were horrible: extremely fatigued, grumpy, felt like a really bad hangover. But by the fourth or fifth day, all of that was gone, and my headaches went too. I&#039;m glad I stuck it out, because I had had headaches that interfered with my daily life. It made me very drowsy at first, and still does act as a bit of a sedative, so I only take it if I plan to sleep very soon. Also, it really lowered my alcohol tolerance, so watch out for that."
