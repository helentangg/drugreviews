"Oh dear. I thought I would give Doxepin a try just to compare it to my usual low dose of Amitriptyline and see if I slept any better. I lasted on this (25mg) just one night, and with less than an hour of sleep. It felt more like a stimulant for me and at one stage I thought I might be experiencing a nasty frightening panic attack. I don&#039;t know what is was but it didn&#039;t agree with me. I find low dose Elavil very sedating next to Doxepin (and more sedating than Mirtazapine). I have never tried Trazodone. Best of luck. :)"
