"Long story short. I have suffered depression for 20+ years and anxiety for the last year which led me to resign from a stressful management position, my co worker recommended zoloft, my GP started me on 50mg which I took for 2 weeks, my dose was increased to 100mg, it has now been  about 6 weeks, I had very few side affects for a few days, slight insomnia, loss of appetite (have lost quite a few kgs) and a little jaw clenching, I feel a lot calmer, I have a little more interest in activities, showering, cooking and cleaning more which are all great results, family members have noticed subtle changes, laughing/smiling and doing more, In saying that I feel as though my dose needs to be increased but will give it 2 weeks, Give it  time:)"
