"Was put on Lexapro in May 2005 after having lost my husband in October 2004.  Worked great for me, headaches at first then those tapered off after about 2 weeks.  Found a job which took my mind off of my grief in December 05, so weened off of Lexapro then stopped altogether.  In June 08 lost my job, the depression came back eventually and finally went back to my Doctor and was put back on Lexapro in April 09 with samples from my Doctor. This worked after about 4 weeks was feeling more like myself and less crying.  Then went to fill my prescription and my insurance company denied it.  My Doctor prescribed Celexa.  Only took it for two nights, and have had shakiness both mornings.  Hoping this will subside.  Have had several bouts of crying spells."
