"I took 2.5 mg. for about a week and it helped incredibly. Then I began taking 5 mg. and after a few weeks I realized that it didn&#039;t help as much as the 2.5 mg. that I took before so I went back to taking only 2.5 mg. and it really helps. If it doesn&#039;t help you need to try taking different amounts and see what works for you."
