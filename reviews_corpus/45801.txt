"My husband was prescribed Prozac approximately 1 month ago. I began to notice a positive change in him within the first week of starting this medication! Before starting Prozac we were arguing quite a bit and he slept pretty much any time he got the chance. He has diabetes and I believe was in denial about that as well. He would not care about any type of exercise or diet. Since beginning Prozac he has purchased a weight set and has begun some exercising...which is MUCH MORE than he was doing before. The arguments we were having are pretty much non-existent! He is SO much easier to get along with now and our marriage is SO much better for it! I definitely recommend this medication to anyone who is depressed or under a lot of stress."
