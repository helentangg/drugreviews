"Currently on week 2 of my experience with Celexa to treat generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and depression. The first couple of days were absolutely terrible due to side effects (nausea, insomnia, headache, flu like symptoms and a huge increase in my depression). Don&#039;t know why I had such a severe reaction to the medication right off the bat since I&#039;ve heard this is one of more tolerant SSRI&#039;s in terms of side effects. But after the a few days my system normalized and I&#039;m already starting to feel like myself again. The doctor said it could take up to 4-6 weeks for it to fully be in effect, but I find myself sleeping through the night and waking up with a much more positive attitude and not on edge with anxiety like I had been in the past. So far so good!"
