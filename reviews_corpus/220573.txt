"I started having headaches about 2 and a half years ago. I had at least 3 per week. Then it got to the point where I had a headache literally EVERY SINGLE DAY. After 2 MRIs, countless blood tests, an eye exam, and seeing a neurologist, no one could tell me why I had a headache every day. It got to the point I couldn&#039;t eat, couldn&#039;t sleep, and couldn&#039;t get anything done. My head hurt so bad I couldn&#039;t move some days. FINALLY a doctor prescribed me 25mg of amitriptyline once a day. I&#039;ve been on it for 3 weeks now and have only had 2 light headaches since taking it. This medicine seriously saved my life. I got so depressed from constant pain. The first week I started taking amitriptyline I was drowsy but I&#039;m fine now. I take it every night before bed."
