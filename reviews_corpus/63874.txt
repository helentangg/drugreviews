"I started off at 50 MG of SERTRALINE  and after a few weeks I started feeling great, I felt more positive, I could sit and watch a whole show or movie with my family. I liked my job more but my appetite did decrease and it made me feel speedy which also made it hard to sleep. Ok so fast forward to 1 month my Dr. decides to up my dosage since it seemed to be agreeing with my body  ( I have depression but mostly anxiety) he upped the dosage to 100 mg tablets. After ONE week I was raging - my family noticed my colleagues noticed.  I felt like I was roided out. I was mean, aggressive and hard to be around. I also felt downl like I didn&#039;t want to be around people anymore. That quickly it all changed. Made a same day appointment with the Dr to switch meds."
