"Here we go again with these meds. I have severe depression.  The best that I can say while taking this medicine is that I was just depressed.  I have no energy and that is saying something because I take 60mg of Adderal daily. To be fair, I don&#039;t know if it was the depression that wiped me out or this medicine.  I need to exercise and enjoyed it in the past, but I couldn&#039;t do ANYTHING on this.  My doc gave me a script for Luvox.  Wish me luck."
