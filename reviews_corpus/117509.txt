"Had stomach pain for years.  When I ate, my stomach would hurt for hours.  When it finally calmed down, it was time to eat again.  Went to a gastroenterologist.  Had a colonoscopy, endoscopy and biopsies. Everything looked all right. Was having awful pain one day and called my gastro doctor for an appt.  He could not see me for weeks, but I was told his nurse could. I was hesitant, but did go in &amp; see her the next day.  She prescribed 10 mg. Pamelor at bedtime (name brand for nortriptyline).  She said it was an antidepressant, but had been found to help many issues. After taking for 3 nights, I felt like a new person.  When I went back for followup, I hugged my nurse and said, &quot;You gave me back my life.&quot;"
