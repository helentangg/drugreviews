"Started taking Pristiq about 4 months ago. I am also taking 300 mg. of trazodone to go to sleep (horrible insomnia). I also take 5 mg of Xanax a day. I started off at 50 mg on the Pristiq but I wasn&#039;t noticing anything different.  I still wanted to hide from everyone and not go to work or school. I now take 100mg of Pristiq and maybe it&#039;s helping? I am smiling at people, I just hope it is not fake."
