"I am rating this a 7 because I was on it for 4 years from 2003-2007.  I was 19 and going through a bad break up with my son&#039;s dad.  Before Zoloft I hated social situations and never wanted to leave the house.  A week after 25mg a night I got off the couch, went to tech school, graduated with honors, got a great paying job. A while after being on Zoloft I started partying, had a bunch of energy. Then had mania. Got visuals, bad thought and high blood pressure. Was diagnosed with bipolar a year ago.  Only been taking Ativan, couldn&#039;t handle Seroquel.  My regular MD wants me to try Zoloft again.  "
