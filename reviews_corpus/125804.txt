"I&#039;ve taken a lot of different antidepressants so my old psychiatrist put me on this one because it was new. I wasn&#039;t doing well, still felt very depressed so she increased my dose. That made my depression worse. I was visiting my family and I lashed out at them, had many episodes, and had to contact the suicide hotline 5 times. I lashed out on my friends as well while on viibryd. I couldn&#039;t contact my psychiatrist at all so I stopped taking it on my own and I instantly started feeling better and noticed a difference."
