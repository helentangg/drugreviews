"I had daily migraines for several years. I have been prescribed many different preventatives but was taking 50mg of Imitrex and 4 Tylenol #3 a day for pain relief.
Since my neurologist started me on Elavil at 25 mg and finally building up to 50 mg a night (2 months ago) I have only used 2 Imitrex and no more Tylenol with Codeine. This is truly miraculous! The only down side is a 10 lb weight gain. I eat a pretty restricted diet to begin with (no butter or fats, lean meats/fish and no sweets or snack foods). I am trying to further reduce my caloric intake to stop the weight gain. Anyway, I would rather be a little chubby and almost pain free."
