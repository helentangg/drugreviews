"Started 12 weeks ago on 50mg stuck it out for 7 weeks - not much change and decided to step up to 100mg - 5 weeks later can say a change has arrived in the last 10 days and I am over the moon.

I have refused medication all my life - this was a massive decision for me ... I wish now I&#039;d done it years ago.

Critical voice gone, anxiety close to gone, depression lifting, motivation returning - hope and dreams coming back.  I now laugh, play jokes and manage stress &#039;normally&#039;.

I have to take care to get enough sleep - some days I am still really exhausted, but that is lifting.

The side effects were as expected, dry mouth, need to eat regularly, headaches and perhaps a little sleep issues - but compared to life before they are well worth it."
