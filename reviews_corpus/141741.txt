"46 YO Male 195lbs with 10 weeks Use: Suffered from anxiety and surely some depression due to prolonged anxiety. Started with 10mg at bedtime. No show-stopping side effects. My side effects were: anorgasmia, tinnitus, constipation, yawning, muscle tension in my neck, lower spine and stomach area, weak erection (initially), some lethargy and having to urinate in the night. At 10mg, anorgasmia was overcome after 14 days and at 20mg dose it took ANOTHER 35 days. I feel happier, more patient, less obsessive, and with reduced anxiety. Side effects now are: mild tinnitus, mild muscle tension in stomach and nightly bathroom run. My advice: Be VERY patient and get your brain chemicals stabilized before you worry about the sex. Your body will adapt again. I&#039;ll use it for life. Good luck!"
