"I began taking elavil for migraines in the summer of 2007. I have had maybe 1 or 2 migraines in a year and a halfs time. Before I had them 3 to 4 days a week. I take 50mg of elavil at bedtime. It has worked wonders and it is a lot cheaper than taking migraine medicine. My only troublesome side effect is that it has greatly increased my appetite."
