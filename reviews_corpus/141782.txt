"Overall I would say this medicine is very succesful in treating my depression.  However, ever since starting (5 months ago) I have insomnia and sexual difficulties.  These two problems are significant enough to where I am choosing to opt off this medicine.  That being said, these type of medicines have different side effects for each individual, i.e. there is no standard side effect.  I would highly recommend this medicine to anyone struggling with depression.  I wish I could stay on this medicine but unfortuantely my inability to sleep and have sex is enough to disturb my regular functioning (especially sleep)."
