"I have been taking Celexa due to many stessful events that made my anxiety almost unbearable. Tough financial times, stress at work, 3 miscarriages, being away from family, etc. My list is huge. I was surprised I lasted this long without medicines. I always tried to convince myself that I could control the panic, fear, stress, sad feelings, etc. Exercise helped but I finally decided to get help. I hate the feeling of always being worried, always going to worst case scenarios, feeling out of place, fearful of even driving, unbearable anxiety of trying to conceive again after my traumatic experiences. Anyway, I was prescribed 20mg of Celexa. Going on week 2 and I hope this is my answer. Already feeling better, no side effects except yawning."
