"It&#039;s probably different for everyone, but the general consensus from what I&#039;ve read (places like WebMD) and from my physician is that antidepressants take 4-6 weeks to take full effect.  I&#039;ve seen many posts here where folks have taken their medicines for 3 days or 2 weeks and are ready to give up already.  Please give your medicines time to work.  Most of them become more effective (to a point) over time.

Hang in there! "
