"I went thru a very difficult time being hurt at work,.I could have easily been killed.  The company making moves to fire me cuz I costs them $ for my &#039;free medical &quot;. Accident was another employee&#039;s negligence. Long story. Plus legal. etc etc
With celexa, my anxiety , stress, depression levels became under control. 

I was able to return back to a resemblance of a human being Was at 40mg to start. Weaned down to 30mg. Then when legal became intense, 40mg. No good settlements in these cases but my sanity is returning. And coping better.
Highly recommend. Side effect was being tired until my body adjusted.
At least got covered by Workers Comp insurance. In Ca, that&#039;s a miracle because for injured parties, you&#039;re fortunate that insurance pays ."
