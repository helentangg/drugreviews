"I have suffered from insomnia for many years.  I have been on Remeron for 10 years but decided to wean off this medication.  I began really having problems staying asleep after completely stopping this medication  I was so very hopeful that Silenor would work for me but sadly after trying it for 10 nights, I have not had success.   I carefully took Silenor on an empty stomach and as directed.  I continue to awaken at 2-3 a.m. and cannot return to sleep."
