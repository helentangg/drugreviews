"OK, so have only been on 50mg sertraline for a week. They did give me an instant calmness which I wasn&#039;t expecting. However, the side effects are a little too much for me. Upset stomach, blurry vision, concentration problems, but the insomnia is the thing that&#039;s getting to me the most. 3 days of virtually no sleep is making me feel terrible. I&#039;m getting off these as the cons outweigh the pros for me, but completely understand why others would stick with them. All medicuness work differently on people, sertraline just won&#039;t be for me."
