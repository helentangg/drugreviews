"My doctor told me to eat lots of protein in the morning. The protein attaches to the active ingredient in the Viibryd. He said the worst side effects of this medicine would be nausea and diarrhea. He told me to eat the equivalent of an Egg McMuffin in the morning with my medicine. I&#039;m up to 10mg and I eat 30-40gm of protein with it. I do have diarrhea, but I&#039;m hopeful that it will go away once my body is accustomed to the new protein requirement. I&#039;m a cereal lover. Eggs, ham and cheese are too much in the mornings some days, but I&#039;m willing to do this because I feel so much better on this medication. I&#039;m not snappy and I seem to have more energy."
