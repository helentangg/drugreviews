"My psychiatrist prescribed me Prozac recently when he diagnosed me with Generalised Anxiety Disorder and depression. My depression and anxiety was really bad. I constantly worried about the same things over and over again and couldn&#039;t control it, got bad panic attacks, could not eat or sleep and became very depressed. Xanax helped me but only temporarily. I&#039;m taking Prozac 20mg nearly two weeks now and already I feel like I&#039;m getting back to myself. I no longer worry, I&#039;m eating and sleeping better and panic attacks are just a thing of the past. The only side effects I have are increased appetite and fatigue. But all I can say is that Prozac is a God send, that I would highly recommend it. It has helped me so much."
