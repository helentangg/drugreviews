"My outstanding physician and another member of the team recommended Cymbalta. I switched over from Zoloft and this medicaton works quite well. I suffer from Anxiety, Depression, PTSD, and severe nerve pains.

The side effects have been quite minimal. I&#039;m more involved in the community through volunteer activities, working, and accomplishing my goals. I&#039;m more social and interactive. My depression and anxiety have decreased by at least 60 percent. My body pain has decreased. I&#039;m more physically active, eating healthier and just more up beat. 

A special thanks goes out to my physician, his team and a fantastic representative who also recommended Cymbalta. Thank you for reading my review."
