"I always read these but never put on my own thoughts. 

I&#039;m a 27 year old female with 2 young beautiful girls, and a very loving husband. It all sounds so perfect but my mood is far from that. I&#039;ve been suffering silently with depression for years but only spoke to my doctor 6 months ago. 

50mg made me worse, my mood was lower than before, shakes, heart palpitations etc but after a week, all side effects stopped but my mood was still lower than ever. 

Upped too 100mg, felt slightly better. Upped again to 150mg still felt better but then all of a sudden my depression got so much worse than it has ever been. Now on 200mg, still feel so low &amp; down &amp; zombified. 

Can&#039;t make decisions, just numb. "
