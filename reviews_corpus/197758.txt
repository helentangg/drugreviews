"Taking Pristiq for severe panic attacks as prescribed by my GP. 6th day into it and already feeling much more calm and clear headed. Some nausea and a little constipation, but please - if that is the trade off to feel much better - than so be it. Not planning on a long-term relationship with Pristiq, however. Using this in conjunction with therapy so I can have some relief while I work through finding the real emotional root of my problems. Pristiq is only a band-aid while I try to heal whatever wounds. Give Pristiq a try, everyone reacts differently, but it has truly been amazing for me so far. Good luck to you, all."
