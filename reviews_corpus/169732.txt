"I take amitriptyline for chronic pain and insomnia.  I have suffered with insomnia for most of my life and nothing seemed to work.  I also had 3 level cervical-spinal fusion/ chronic pain/major trochanter bursitis. I recently moved to a new state and found a life saver in my new doctor.  Along with my normal pain management (Morphine/vicodin/muscle relaxer) he suggested Elavil.  I was weary at first, but thought why not.  Because of my high tolerance to medicines, he started me out at 50mg.  After 1 week, I was AMAZED. I slept through the night and my pain seemed to subside to tolerable.  After a few dosage adjustments, I am now on 100mg and with the exception of weight gain, I am so very happy."
