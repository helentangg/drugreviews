"Great medicine, stopped me being so irritable and angry.I had Depression, Anxiety and OCD  to start with. I did feel spacey and more suicidal for the first week so don&#039;t drive during that time, I also felt very dizzy. I have been taking it for over a year and it does make me drowsy every day, so I take it before bed which ideally helps with my insomnia too! I&#039;m on 150mg per day. If you are worried about your mental health, make sure you get help. It was the hardest, best thing I ever did."
