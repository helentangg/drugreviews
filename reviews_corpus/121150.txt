"Well I began the regular rx of Pristique as samples, seemed to work great, went to fill the rx and insurance wouldn&#039;t covered it. So I guess venlafaxine is generic for this, however it is not at all like Pristque. For a week and a half I had horrible I mean horrible nausea &amp; vomiting.... I tried to stick it out but I couldn&#039;t. In addition I also had chronic heat sweats/feeling flushed &amp; dozzy, diarrhea, and bad headaches! Wait lets not forget, the libido was there, but all sensativity etc was gone out the window and ran down the street! This stuff was brutal &amp; I was miserable, I couldn&#039;t wait for the Doc to say I could quit.... I just quit cold turkey cause anything would be better than that. Definitely not a fan of these meds!"
