"I&#039;ve been on many medications for over 20 years. Name it, I&#039;ve probably been on it. Pristiq is expensive and takes a chunk out of my budget. No shopping, mani/pedis etc. I pay for the non generic name brand and have my life back.
I was sucidal less than two months ago after the death of my nephew. This medicine is worth every dollar."
