"I&#039;ve been on Pristiq now for about 4 months. I could tell the difference in my moods almost right away. Every little thing used to make me cry, but not any longer. The only side effect I experienced was dry mouth. Really wish I  could have felt a decrease in appetite. The withdrawals are pretty bad for me though. One day I forgot to take it and almost pulled my hair out. I was crying uncontrollably over nothing which I didn&#039;t even do before taking the medicines. I was also having major brain zaps. I recommend coming off slowly. All in all though, I love it."
