"I had been suffering from depression and anxiety for years, in 2014 was put on to sertraline and felt better for a few months until the symptoms returned. A year later the doctor doubled my dose and things started to calm down again. I&#039;ve recently been to have a review of my medication and was put on to 10mg citalopram. I can&#039;t describe how much this has had a positive effect on my life, from day 3 of taking it my palpitations had gone, the sweats &amp; faint feelings had disappeared. It really is an amazing medication if it works well for you."
