"I started using paroxetine 12.5 CR generic (Pexep 12.5 CR) - it was to treat my mild depression, mostly caused by moderate GAD (general anxiety disorder) and moderately severe social phobia.

First 2 days were mild headaches (not bad enough to get an aspirin), also felt noticeably more tired than usual. 3rd day, felt great. Not like an &#039;on&#039; switch from the day before, but I did feel noticeably more comfortable around people and just felt better.

Did not have any problems with libido or weight gain."
