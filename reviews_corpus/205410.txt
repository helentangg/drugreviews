"I had a major breakdown and was put on 50mg Pristiq, increased to 100mg. I noticed an immediate improvement (on the 50mg) because it stopped the uncontrollable crying. I have been on the medication for 2.5 years but got severe headaches if I missed a pill. I reduced the dosage to 50mg for a year and still got headaches and dizziness if I missed a pill. So, as I am no longer depressed I am coming off this medication. I reduced the dose to 1 tablet every second day for 2 weeks and this is now the 3rd week.I have now been without the tablets for 4 days and have noticed quite a lot of dizziness but no more headaches. I am feeling good about myself and have returned to my positive outlook on life. I am happy to be coming off this medication."
