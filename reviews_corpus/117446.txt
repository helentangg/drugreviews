"Have suffered with back pain for 22 yrs. I&#039;m 60 yrs old now.  Started taking nortriptyline 4 days ago. While I know that&#039;s not very long I can say back pain is much better. Depression is much better. Overall feeling is much better. Sleeping better and longer. I have noticed some drowsiness but not a lot. I hope things continue in the direction I&#039;m currently headed. Good luck!"
