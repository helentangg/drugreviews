"I have been taking Prozac for 9 months and have constantly had to experience the tiredness it causes and lack of motivation.  I have now supplemented it with 150 mg of Wellbutrin and notice a huge difference.  I am more alert, energetic, can concentrate and want to get out of the house instead of lying around. I can still feel the Serotonin effects of Prozac, so its the best of both worlds."
