"Prozac is NOT for everyone.  I was prescribed 10mg for my anxiety.  I felt awesome for about two days on this medicine, then the insomnia, mood swings, and rage set in.  It helped my anxiety, but the effects on my mood were absolutely intolerable.  I started feeling dizzy and my eyes hurt like I was staring in the sun too long.  I think it totally flooded my brain with serotonin and it was like system overload.  This is way too strong of a medication for someone with moderate anxiety and not much depression.  For someone who is severely depressed, it might help--it definitely boosts energy."
