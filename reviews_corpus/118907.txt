"I have been on Zoloft/Sertraline for only a couple of days but can instantly feel the effects. I cannot stop taping my feet/moving my legs maybe its energy that I didn&#039;t have for a while. I&#039;m not sure. It is affecting my stomach but will see how it goes for a couple of weeks. Could do with losing a bit of weight.

Could not sleep for love nor money last night, mind was active, but actually felt like I could have a laugh with my wife in the evening, she says I have been really horrible to be with (moaning etc).

At work, feel like I&#039;m on edge but hoping once it really kicks in I will feel more &#039;myself&#039;. Extremely tired and keep yawning and feeling less emotional, for a 29 year old man. I will update after a few weeks to advise how its going."
