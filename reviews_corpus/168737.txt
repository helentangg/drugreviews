"I&#039;ve been on several different antidepressants over the past 18 years but I must say that I&#039;ve felt the best being on Viibryd. In the beginning of it I did suffer with diarrhea for approximately 6 weeks. The only two complaints I have with it is that I have a decreased sex drive and I&#039;ve gained almost 45 lbs over a 1.5 years."
