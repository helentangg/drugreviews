"Pristiq has helped me keep my life together. Before Pristiq I would break down so easily. Pristiq has restored my confidence in myself and has leveled out my moods. I still have a lot of days where I don&#039;t have any energy or want to do anything but there are a lot less of those days than before. I&#039;ve been on 100 mg. for a year now."
