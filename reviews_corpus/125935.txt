"I started on 10mg for 7 days and was feeling less reactive and calm. Started 20mg and 3 days in was spiraling into deep depression, agitation, irritability, crying, not sleeping more than 2 hours at a time, shock like sensations down my right arm with my middle finger going completely numb, and headaches in back of head . I already have IBS so I expected GI distress. Nausea for 3 days along with severe diarrhea for about 2 weeks. Diarrhea is intermittent now. I am waiting to hear from my doc about reducing dose to 10mg again. I think that might be my ticket. Good luck to all!!"
