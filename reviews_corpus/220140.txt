"I have had classical migraine (with aura) since I was 12.  They disappeared completely in my 20s but returned when I became pregnant.  Following two pregnancies I have had about 6 silent migraines (visual aura but no headache) a year until this year when I started to have alot more (still silent) migraines.  I realise I am very lucky to not have full blown headaches, but they have still been incapacitating and scary.  After having six migraines in a week I started to take amytriptiline (10mg).  I&#039;ve been taking it now for about 11 weeks and have had three mild migraine auras since then.  Seems to be working -- will persevere.  No side effects after first week."
