"I&#039;ve been on this medicine for approximately 4 mos.  I had pretty severe and constant anxiety.  The first 3 weeks on this medicine were hell.  Severe panic attacks, loss of palette and teeth/jaw clenching.  I&#039;m glad I hung on there because the anxiety has almost completely subsided.  Only sometimes can I feel the anxiety wanting to surface but it never fully does. This medicine has been a God send. My husband has noticed a huge difference in me. I have gained a small amount of weight and feel a little more &quot;scatterbrained&quot; sometimes.  However, that&#039;s better than constantly obsessing over every detail!"
