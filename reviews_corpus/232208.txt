"I&#039;ve taken 40 mg of paxil for anxiety and depression for 14 years and it was life changing. Slowly it hasn&#039;t been as effectIve and recently I felt as though I hadn&#039;t been taking anything at all. Now I&#039;m back to where I was before paxil and feeling like an emotional mess. My Dr just increased my paxil to 50 mg and then if that doesn&#039;t work, she may have me try something else. I&#039;m wondering if anyone else has experienced this?"
