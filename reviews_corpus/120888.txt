"I&rsquo;m 25 and have newly diagnosed fibromyalgia and depression diagnosed from a very young age (about 6 y.o) I have always felt a stabbing, &ldquo;zinging&rdquo; radiating / pulsating pain in more than 8 parts of my body. I know that with depression and anxiety (which I also have) it comes with the crappiness of muscle pains, general malaise and weakness. Due to kind of &ldquo;holding myself together&rdquo; (mentally and physically) on a daily basis , I&rsquo;ve developed poor posture. Daily habits of clenching my body or hunching to dull certain pains and finding ways to sit that are moderately comfortable, have made me feel like a prisoner in my own body. After a week on these meds, I wake up feeling rested and alive! My body works how it SHOULD and the pains are gone!"
