"It works wonderfully. I&#039;ve tried many antidepressants and they all left me feeling, not sad. But I still felt lethargic and hopeless. Effexor gives me motivation and drive. Helps me get out of bed in the morning and off the couch during the day. And it started working within the first week. The ONLY drawback I&#039;ve found is it really decreases my libido and you CANNOT miss a dose. It will really ruin your day."
