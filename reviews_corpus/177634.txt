"I took Cymbalta for 9 month during that time was also taking Oxycontin and Vicadine. I still had pain and the Cambalta raised my cholesterol 50 points, it also raised my blood pressure the Doctor didn&#039;t seemed to be concerned with symptoms. which concern me due to the fact that I had heart disease about 10 years prior to taking Cymbalta ahead 3 stents inserted into my arteries of my heart. I had heart disease at a young age of age 37.  The two doctors I was seen at the time didn&#039;t believe that cymbalta was raising my cholesterol. I had to do my own research on the internet to find evidence that Cymbalta does raise cholesterol. The manufacturer of Cymbalta indicated that the raising cholesterol was a rare side effect."
