"After taking many antidepressants with temporary satisfaction and happiness for a few months, I decided to try Effexor for almost a year. It worked good for my anxiety and anger issues but not for my depression (It had the usual mild side effects like weight gain). Now I&#039;m back on Lexapro (as this and Cymbalta worked best for me). To all: Don&#039;t be alarmed from all the horror stories of Effexor withdrawal. I weaned off with no worse discontinue symptoms then other medicines! As a matter of fact, I love the electric brain zaps! LOL."
