"I have been taking 20mg citalopram for almost 3 months now. It has changed my life! A few years ago I started having panic attacks. I have been to the ER about 4 or 5 times. Have spent thousands of dollars on EKG, stress tests, wearing the halter heart monitor... you name it! In the end they all said the same thing... anxiety. Continued to take Xanax when I felt an attack coming on. Finally my physician suggested this. For the first 6 weeks or so I had fatigue, excessive yawning, no sex drive or ability to climax. Although I noticed my anxiety attacks becoming more mild and fewer of them.   After about 8 weeks most of the side effects have gone away. I feel great! Happy and full of energy! Give it time.. it is worth it!"
