"I have not taken this drug yet, but I will be doing in 4 hours and I&rsquo;m excited but nervous. 
I have had shooting/pricking pains in the left side of my head for around 3 months now, and I have always put it to one side thinking that it&rsquo;s just normal or it&rsquo;s a headache / stress / pressure / apart of growing up ( I&#039;m 22 ) and I&rsquo;ve not looked into it. I decided to ring 111, they directed me to a walk in centre then to the GP and I&rsquo;ve now been prescribed with Amitriptyline. 
After reading through all of the comments, I have been given 10mg tablets and I will be taking it whole. There are solutions for the side effects so dosage is ok. 
I am scared a tiny bit that I have a bloods test, if no result, I will be getting a head scan :( fingers crossed"
