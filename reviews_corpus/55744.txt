"I have been through the gamut of antidepressant meds. Celexa,  Lexapro, cymbalta, Zoloft, fetzima and several others over the last 13 years.  My doctor kept leading me away from Effexor because of the bad withdrawals it has. This drug is working pretty well so far. My insurance lapsed tho once. I went without meds for 4 days and I was on a high dose. She was right about those withdrawals.  The worst I&#039;ve ever had. Severe nightmares, sweats, extremely low energy, brain zaps, every noise would set my head in a tailspin.  I&#039;ve had pain med withdrawal and benzo withdrawal and nothing compares to coming of this med. Thankfully my insurance kicked back in and after a day and half I was starting to feel better again. It works. But not w/o risks"
