"I was on lexapro for 5 years at 30 mg but was tired of always being tired all day and not caring, after the DNA test I found out lexapro wasn&#039;t for me and my dr switched me to pristiq- it&#039;s only day 6 but I notice more energy and less anxious.  Hopefully this continues to improve and work- will update later."
