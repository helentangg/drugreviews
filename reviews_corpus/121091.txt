"I was aware of the side affects, however, when you have 15 years of constant pain you will try anything! I have recently started Botox for my migraines my Neurosurgeon had said last year that he was going to take me off the medicine. By reading the reviews, I know brain zaps and other conditions would be a struggle. I was only taking 150mg in the morning of Effexor. I just started taking 1 in the morning and I&#039;ve done fine since. One day I did forget to take the 1 dose and by 8pm I was feeling brain zaps. So I looked up other reviews and they stated to take a xanax in place. I&#039;m going to alternate 75mg one day and xanax the other. Eventually the side affects will go away. Be careful getting off this medicine! It works, but is hell lol"
