"Hi just thought I would share my experience with you all,I too have searched the Internet for reviews on sertraline and was so nervous about taking it...I&#039;ve tried 2 times and failed but 3rd time lucky! Been on them 1 week started taken mine right before bed in the hope of sleeping through most of the side affects! Which has worked :) feeling lots better in myself my anxiety has been pushed at bay more than before, I know I&#039;ve got a long way yet till this fully works but so far so good! Don&#039;t be worried about giving sertraline a go I know how scary it feels to have to take medicine that your unsure of but it&#039;s worth a try I&#039;m on 25mg as 50mg was to strong...wish me luck and hopefully this will help you in deciding the best route :)"
