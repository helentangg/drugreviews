"I was put on Lexapro 4 years ago. I didn&#039;t think it was doing anything except keeping me from having to run to the bathroom all the time after an intestinal infection. It did a good job at that but 3 months ago I did not have the money for the copay and thought I could do without it. I was so wrong. I am so depressed and anxious I can barely stand it.  I started back on it last night and hope it kicks in soon. If this Lexapro helps again I do not plan on going off it again. The side effects are minimal. "
