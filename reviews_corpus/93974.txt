"I almost never experience major side effects from any medications, and I have been off and on many antidepressants over the past 14 years. I was taking zoloft for a couple months, which was helping with my depressive symptoms, but I though it might&#039;ve been giving me sexual side effects, but I wasn&#039;t sure so my doctor suggested trying trintellix. He said it has a lower incidence of sexual side effects.  Well, not only did trintellix give me horrible sexual dysfunction and even lower libido, every time I took this drug for two weeks, I literally felt like I was coming down with the FLU about 15 minutes later.  Headaches, nausea, vomiting, heartburn, feverish.  I really do think this stuff is poisonous, and needs to be pulled from the market."
