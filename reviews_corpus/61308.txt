"I had tried numerous anti depressants before settling on Citalopram. It had the least unpleasant side effects for me. I have taken a small dose daily for approx 5 years. It seems to help me to not feel so low. I&#039;m not sure if some of it is possibly psychosomatic eg a placebo affect. But I&#039;ll keep using it as long as it seems to help. My type of depression has been long term since 18. I&#039;m now 53."
