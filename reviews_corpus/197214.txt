"I have been on Paxil for about 15-16 yrs now. I have probably had social anxiety problems since grade school. It just got worse. Paxil is a good medicine for me but not sure at this point that 30 to 20 mg was a good weaning action. My social anxiety in AA has now increased due to decrease in medicine. 
When I look at the &quot;good&quot; Paxil has done, it far outweighs the &quot;bad&quot;. Having social anxiety is something that can isolate a person. I am not perfect in that regard, but this medicine has definitely been a positive thing in my life. It&#039;s not perfect, as I have to work on myself constantly, but it has helped me!"
