"Have found this med effective. Have been taking 20mg maintenance dosage for 2 months. Nausea continues daily (morning is when take my dose) for a couple of hours - but the &quot;volume&quot; of the world around me is way down - as is the irrational rage/anger/frustration that follows when not on medication. Sleeping through the nights. As effective as Cymbalta, Zoloft and others I&#039;ve taken - I hope this one continues to work - the others stopped after a while."
