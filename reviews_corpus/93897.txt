"This medicine... I feel like there is something wrong with it. 
The first three weeks, I was nauseous all the time. I did have a feeling of euphoria for the first couple of weeks despite the sickness. 
The weirdest side effects were the loss of taste and smell.  Seriously weird. I couldn&#039;t smell any odor at all and as for taste? Nothing.  I could eat jalapenos straight out of the jar like they were m&amp;m&#039;s. It was crazy!!! 

I finally stopped taking it. I was still anxious and found myself to be listless and tired, so why bother? Besides the symptoms were too much to deal with.

I have been off Trintellix for almost 3 weeks now. I&#039;d say that my ability to taste and smell are still at 25%.  I&#039;m worried that they will never come back."
