"I&#039;ll start by saying I am a 24 year old graduate who started on Lexapro 20mg about 3 years ago.  It worked so after 2 years I stopped it.  The year in between then and now obvious depressive/social anxiety symptoms recurred.  Went to the Doctor and was prescribed 50mg generic sertraline.  Its only been 4 days and I say it is GRADUALLY working-as it should.  Some noticed side effects include diarrhea and a little insomnia, little hyperness but that&#039;s it. Also a trick to get off SSRI&#039;s-take a B-complex with Omega 369 complex. Feel better friends."
