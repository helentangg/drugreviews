"Since my car accident a little over year ago I shattered my femur, had a compound fracture in my tib and fib and had previous issues with my back, bad L4 and L5 herniations and my S1 is also herniated as my sacrum was fractured in the accident. It was a very traumatic accident, if you saw the pictures of my car you would have a hard time believing anybody lived through it so I now have lots of hardware in my left leg and no idea what happened.  I had my dogs in the car and they didn&#039;t have a scratch. Been through 3 surgeries and numerous hospital stays and last weekend my 20 y/o &quot;bf&quot;/(was dating him) passed on, this medication has really helped me to be able to sleep through the night; including helping with pain, depression, anxiety &amp; grief"
