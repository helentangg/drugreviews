"So I&#039;m on 20mg taken in the morning. To treat PTSD and OCD intrusive thoughts. 
I&#039;m on 20mg taken in the morning. I&#039;m on my 11th day. Today I woke up feeling extremely anxious. Border of a panic attack so I took half of a 0.5 lorazepam to take the edge off. I do notice that at times my intrusive thoughts and normal ones just race going back and forth. But physically I am calm. I&#039;m not breaking down as easily which I have noticed improvement. This is why I&#039;m hanging in there. And giving this a chance. I do notice something that has heightened, and that would be my urge to run and be outside. It&#039;s all fed by my anxiety that&#039;s why I don&#039;t let it bother me much.
I have noticed that I am walking outdoors more often."
