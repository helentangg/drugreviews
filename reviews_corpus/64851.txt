"I started on 10mg off citalopram when I was 16, they had zero effect so they upped me to 20mg of fluoxetine which made my severe depression worse, my brother was also prescribed fluoxetine and we both experience and major increase in suicidal thoughts whilst on them so I went back to the doctor. He then prescribed me with sertraline 50mg. The first few weeks of taking them were a nightmare, I&#039;d wake up and take the tablet with my breakfast and I&#039;d finds myelf being exhausted all then time and then I&#039;d struggle to sleep at night.  My partners mum is on sertraline 100mg and she said that the best thing to do is take them half an hour before you go to bed because the tiredness  effect doesn&#039;t take long to kick in. Now I feel a lot happier"
