"Hi Everyone, I&#039;ve recently been offered a very good job in the insurance industry training bank staff on insurance products and doing presentations to different people EVERY DAY. I am an insurance specialist but have never had to present to strangers let alone present to a new bank with new people every day. I&#039;m in day 3 of my new role, first day went shaky, but okay. Second day went alot better, but this morning my social anxiety got the better of me and I choked in my presentation this morning. My words came out wrong, I started shaking and sweating. I had to get up for a glass of water. I couldn&#039;t continue and I felt embarrassed in from of a crowd of people listening to &quot;the expert&quot;. I blamed it on my asthma. What do I do???"
