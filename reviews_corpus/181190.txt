"I was reluctant to go on an SSRI as I was concerned about weight gain and fatigue. However, I was in such a bad headspace back in the spring that I bit the bullet and saw my doctor about it. She prescribed me generic Prozac (fluoxetine). Initially I was on 10 mg, then worked up to 20 mg. It&#039;s made such a positive difference. I haven&#039;t had any near-panic attacks, and my anxiety feels much more manageable. Life feels easier. I&#039;ve had some side effects, such as excessive yawning (and I mean excessive!), some mild nausea, and vivid dreams. To me, though, the benefits far outweigh them. I&#039;m going to keep taking it and use the coping skills I learned in therapy."
