"I was put on Paxil for anxiety, depression and OCD.  I have loved it!  The only side effect is a bit of tension/anxiety that they say will pass.  But the big problem has been the fact that I cannot orgasm anymore.  I have been on Paxil on for 5 weeks, but noticed this problem in the first week.  I have an appointment with the doctor to have an update and discuss this issue.  Will post the results as I don&#039;t really see anyone else posting what has helped with this."
