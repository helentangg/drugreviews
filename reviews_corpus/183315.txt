"Started taking Cymbalta as a last resort for radicular sciatica pain. Had surgery, tried many medicines. Been on Cymbalta for 1.5 mos. (5 days-20 mg, 5 days - 40 mg, 1 1/2 weeks - 60 mg, 2 days- 40 mg, 2 days- 30 mg). I experienced most of the side effects (nausea, lethargy, somnolence (sleeping 18-20 hrs a day for 3 wks from that to insomnia to today&#039;s date, flatulence, constipation, tingling all over, throat pain, blurry vision, nightmares, night terrors waking in drenching sweats, profuse sweating, hair loss). This is the weirdest medicine I&#039;ve taken.  Taken Fluoxetine for years with no unusual side effects or withdrawals. Reducing because of side effects of night terrors, sweats, etc. It does work for pain but the cost is high."
