"I&#039;m 27 years old and have been to the doctors many many times. I&#039;ve had nausea, vomiting, weight loss and headaches/migraines, for over a year now. I&#039;ll have a few days to a week with no symptoms and then they come right back. I&#039;ve had appointments with gastroenterologist and have had a colonoscopy and endoscopy done. I&#039;ve been to the hospital on a few occasions due to my vomiting. Doctors still don&#039;t know whats wrong. They have put me on acid reflex medications, which don&#039;t help much. I have talked to my doctor about the possibility of me having CVS. He hasn&#039;t said that&#039;s what I have but prescribed me Amitriptyline. Just started it yesterday... Hope it works. Close to losing my job if I cant get this under control....."
