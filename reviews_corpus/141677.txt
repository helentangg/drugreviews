"Prescribed for anxiety, GAD, MDD. After being on Zoloft for several years, when my depression and anxiety spectrum returned we decided to try Lexapro. It just never felt &#039;right&#039; from day 1. After several months, I noticed the feelings did not improve and I figured I would need to live with it. Now almost a year since starting, I&#039;ve made the switch back to a low dose of Zoloft. Within weeks, I again feel &#039;normal&#039; and I am not plagued by the overall unease I felt on Lexapro (specifically increased anxiety, developing agoraphobia, EXTREME laziness and no motivation, obsessive thoughts and headaches).

Being mindfull now, everyone IS different. We all are wired uniquely. I know many people who love Lexapro. Not for me, though."
