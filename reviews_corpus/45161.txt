"I started taking Prozac (fluxoetine) for bulimia and depression. The first four weeks I had side effects like: crazy nightmares, waking up in the middle of the night with extreme panic and feeling disconnected from reality. It was hard but my doctor also said that the more side effects you have in the beginning, the better the medication will work on your brain. So don&#039;t give up! After about 4 weeks a switch turned on! I felt like myself, even better then myself, for the first time in years! I got happier, more confident, more energy, and the bulimia stopped! It was truly a life saver. I didn&#039;t notice any sexual stuff, I was horny as usual! And all the other side effects disappeared. I didn&#039;t feel emotionally disconnected, just more stable."
