"I went on Paxil a year after father died 15 years ago. I was told it was non-addictive and started on a low-mid dosage, 20mg.  It helped and was on it for about 10-12 years.  I just accepted that I needed it.  Everyone is correct about not missing doses - if I missed 2-3 days, I&#039;d get very emotional, cry at drop of a hat, etc. - which I unfortunately took as proof that I needed to stay on it - I didn&#039;t understand it was the withdrawal effects!  Over time, with ups/downs in career, I gradually increased dosages, going to 40 mg/day. In late 2010, after out of work for 2-3 years, I went back to general dr and he prescribed 60mg/day.  Within a couple months, I was in downward spiral. "
