"This medicine was the 1st thing in YEARS that made me feel like myself again. It started working within a few days. The panic attacks subsided almost immediately and the depression lifted. The side effects I experienced (although annoying) were nothing compared to the benefits it gave me. The 1st 2 weeks I was nauseous and tired, felt out of it but my head was clearer and thoughts focused after that. I did lose like 20 pounds, it stopped my emotional eating. The worst part was the night sweats I had for about 2 months or so. I was on it for about 5 months but had to wean off due to lack of insurance. Coming off was terrible though... total withdrawal, brain zaps, confusion etc. I&#039;ll get back on it as soon as I can because I know it did wonders."
