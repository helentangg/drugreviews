"Very positive. Reduced senseless anxiety though a perceived negative is that it also aids in supressing useful anxiety. For example, situations of potential physical conflict that pre Cymbalta I wisely walked away from I tend not to do whilst taking the drug. It doesn&#039;t make me angry or violent it simply makes me less concerned about the possibilty of a negative outcome."
