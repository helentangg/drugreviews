"I&#039;ve been on Paxil for 16 yrs and overall it&#039;s been a positive in my life. There have been days through the years when anxiety has still arisen.
This spring depression returned and my dr increased my dosage from 20-30 mg.  After a month my mood stabilized, depression lifted and I&#039;ve been able to resume enjoying life again.  However, last night I drank 3 beers and today have walked around like a zombie.  Not worth the after effects!!"
