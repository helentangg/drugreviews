"Best (and most expensive) medication I&#039;ve ever been on. I&#039;ve  been prescribed to every other SSRI and they gave me side effects of sleepiness, and indifference. I have only experienced a slight nausea for about 2 hours, 15 minutes after I take my Trintellix. This only lasted the first two weeks. The nausea is the only reason I give this a 9/10. Anxiety and paranoia have been greatly reduced, energy is amazing and no sleepiness or indifference. Had genetic testing done and I am deficient in folic acid and don&#039;t produce it on my own. I complement the Trintellix with methylfolate by biotics lab (Deplin is expensive). I&#039;m happier than I&#039;ve ever been and no sexual dysfunctions have happened so I am extremely thankful for this medication"
