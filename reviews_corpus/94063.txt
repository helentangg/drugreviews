"This medication is a game changer. I&#039;ve been on 20 mg once per day (at night works best for me) for about 5 months. It is by far the best medication I have tried. Initially started on 10 mg, and raised my dose 2 months in. 

Pros : Overall heightened mood, more energy, ability to feel array of emotions, no sexual dysfunction (many anti-depressants are famous for cashing this), increases ability to enjoy activities I used to love. 

Neutral : does not treat my anxiety very well alone.

Cons: nausea when starting the medication and increasing dose, more expensive than traditional anti depressants.



Overall, I love this medication. I will definitely continue on it. I have seen a big improvement since trying Trintellix."
