"After I had my child I soon started to cry, be angry all the time, felt bored of life, nothing excited me. So I was suggested to take Citalopram, it started to work within 3 weeks I only got headaches and a little bit of diarrhea. Then I finally felt like there was light at the end of the tunnel my anxiety and panic attacks also went away nearly a year I have to decided I want another child so I am slowly ( with doctors permission ) coming off so far a little cloudy some days but so far so good. Trying to stay positive. Depression can be fixed with the right treatment speak up."
