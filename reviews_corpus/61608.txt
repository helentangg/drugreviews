"Ive always been a moody person, but since having my 2nd child it had become a whole new animal. PMDD had left me feeling very lonely, helpless and worthless, I was tired of hearing myself apologize again for my awful behaviour during those last 2 weeks of my cycle, only to find myself back there 2 weeks later, My kids were suffering, my relationhip was too and At my lowest during my cycle, I was starting to plan my suicide. I went to my doctor, sure he would just brush me off, thinking it was just you know, slamming cupboards and sore boobs (if only!!)  I went during my down weeks so he could see the state I was in, I was so desperate for relief.  Started Celexa that day and its changed my life, if you have PMDD you must try this."
