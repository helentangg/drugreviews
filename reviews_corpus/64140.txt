"First time prescribed solotik last week 50mg for mild anxiety when I first wake up and depression which gets severe close to my period. First day of solotik I felt amazing I was ready to do all the great things and wonder if this is how I should normally feel. Second day: &quot;booom!&quot; What is that? side effects (hands sweating, anxiety, hot flashes, sleeping during the day, anxiety, nausea, no appetite, constipation, migraine, foggy memory, numb, no focus, awakened 4-6am by panic attack, itchy, lazy, nightmares, period late) spoke to my doc he insisted I continue. 4 days of hell pills down the drain now :) I miss my old emotional, deep, sensitive self. My memories, connection. Who had ability to write and feel small to big things in life."
