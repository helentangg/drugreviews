"I felt the change after the first dose and now I can live again. I was always so scared to even leave the house, I was always so jealous of my wife thinking she would cheat or that someone was talking about me, always afraid what people thought. I look back now and think who was that person? Now with all kinds of energy my sex life is so much better, I am losing weight, I was an emotional eater. That&#039;s gone. I am a new man, I am a better person. Zoloft saved my life my marriage. I am so focused now I have accomplished more in 6 months than in 6 yrs. Not really any side effects that are bad other than a little tremble once in awhile and I cant sleep sometime."
