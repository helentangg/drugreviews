"For over 20 years I&#039;ve used antidepressants and this by far is the best I&#039;ve ever used however there are some downsides I&#039;m constantly hungry all d time I&#039;ve put on 2stone which is giving me another problem to deal with cause that doesn&#039;t make me feel good and excessive sweating I&#039;ve reduced my dose with doctors supervision to try help these side affects and the tiredness is sooo bad  but I&#039;ve definitely had little or no anxiety"
