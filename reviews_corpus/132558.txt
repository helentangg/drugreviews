"I couldn&#039;t stay asleep, tried Lunesta and Ambien, they had side effects I couldn&#039;t tolerate.  Sleep center said I had mild apnea and said their monitors showed me sleeping but I felt like I was awake more than they said I was and was literally exhausted every day, felt like I was on the verge of &quot;losing it,&quot; crying a lot.  Was not sad/depressed--was sleep deprived.  Have been taking 2 Silenor a night for 2 years:  sleep like a baby, 8 hours required, wake up rested, functioning beautifully--I have my life back."
