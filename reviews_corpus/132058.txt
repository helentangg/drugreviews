"I have been taking Effexor XR for approximately 6 months now.  My hot flashes were very severe.  I would be soaked and wet from top of my head down to my legs.  Cold glass of water hardly touched it.  After taking Effexor I only have little sweating around my head and neck maybe two to five times a month.  It is a great relief."
