"I was on Remeron 30mg for almost six months. In the beginning looked like it works. Unfortunately starting from last month, my mornings were terrible. No mood at all, didn&#039;t want to go out of bed and home. Also the rest of the day was slow and agonizing. 

Yesterday my GP asked me to start Cipralex (escitalopram) 10mg. 

You might not believe it but from the first pill I already feel GREAT. Full of energy and positive mood. It looks like a miracle!"
