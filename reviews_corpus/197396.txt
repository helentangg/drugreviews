"I have been on Paxil for 10 years with no side effects. Great to relieve anxiety and depression.  I recently had to take predisone and it has thrown everything out of whack.  The doctor increased my Paxil by 10 MG. Been on the increased dose for 16 days and have not seen a great improvement.  I hope and pray it kicks in soon this raises my dose to 30 MG from 20 that I was on for all those years."
