"I&#039;ve had so many unpleasant side effects with this medicine. At 40 mgs this medication made my obsessive compulsive disorder and panic attacks worse. My doctor told me to go back down to 20 mgs. Feel slightly better but OCD is still pretty bad. I know everyone is different but this medication hasn&#039;t helped me."
