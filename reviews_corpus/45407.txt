"I started with a very low dose to treat depression - 10mg.  I also had become quite the &#039;alcoholic&#039;; binge drinking right down to the last drop.  Had no motivation and lots of self pity.  Prozac helped me recover my lost personality; gave me hope and curbed the drinking to full time sobriety.  I take 20mg a day - I would suggest that folks give it two months before giving up.  I&#039;m glad I did.  Nine months of no drinking and I work full time."
