"I&#039;ve had depression for years and very high anxiety which at one point I could barely breathe and I had to focus on my breath  to calm down at all. I took xanax for 6 months a year ago. It helped a little with anxiety but not for depression very well. I got off xanax last year and took nothing at all. I felt like I was losing my mind and had thoughts of just ending my emotional and mental agony. I went back to my Dr and he gave me Lexapro and xanax. For the first time in years my face doesn&#039;t grimace in emotional pain and I feel happy. I don&#039;t know if Lexapro could do that by itself,  but with xanax it&#039;s saved my life."
