"I have suffered with chronic daily tension headaches for most of my life with a full blown migraine about twice yearly. For me, the daily headaches had become a routine form of torture that I had accepted. As a nurse, I avoided talking to the doctor because I knew a lot of the prophylactic meds were antidepressants or anti seizure meds and I just didn&#039;t want to take those types of meds. As  my headaches increased to about 5 days per week, I finally decided to get on a new med. I have been on eleavil 12.5mg nightly for 2 weeks. I have not had a single headache and I am beyond thrilled. I have never posted on a blog like this before, but I am so excited about the results I just had to share. As for side effects, I have not had any thus far."
