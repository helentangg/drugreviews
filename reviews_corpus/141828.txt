"I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder at 16. I was put on Xanax and Lexapro 20mg. After getting married and the birth of my second child we moved from NJ to FL. I was off Lexapro with both pregnancies. I moved 2 FL AT 25 WITH A 19 MONTH OLD AND 8 WEEK OLD! Post partum depression hit me hard. I went to a MD and requested Lexapro 20mg and Xanax 3mg/day. I have tried many many many other SSRIs due to cost of Lexapro. They all made me feel MORE nutty even Celexa, Lexapros &quot;brother&quot;. I ALWAYS wind up back on Lexapro. This is a miracle for me! I feel calmer within 24 hours and I can&#039;t make myself anxious if I tried. I sleep sound and am happy and a better mother. I love Lexapro and despite the price and 10lb weight gain. I&#039;m 5&#039;9 n 140 lbs."
