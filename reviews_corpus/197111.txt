"I have been on Paxil for 18 years now. Within the last seven years I have developed severe muscle tightness. I go to massage Thearapist and chiropractor every two weeks... This helps sometimes other times I&#039;m still in pain. I&#039;m going to see a rheumatologist next week who thinks it&#039;s I might have an immune disorder since I was just diagnosed with raynauds in my toes.

Paxil has helped my anxiety but sometimes I feel like I have no emotions and don&#039;t react to things that I should be. Which is good and bad. 

Take care of yourself if you&#039;re not feeling well see if a different medication works are different alternatives!! It just took me 18 years."
