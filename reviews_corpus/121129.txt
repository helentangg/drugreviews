"Never knew how powerful this drug is until I tried to replace it with Cymbalta. Within 2 days of switching, my anxiety was sky high and my depression was so severe that I literally was suicidal. Went back on it and these symptoms subsided quickly. By no means this is the perfect drug but it seems to be a bit better than others. I wish it would control anxiety better. I have to take lorazepam to control anxiety fully."
