"I have been taking Pristiq for about 4 weeks now. I have minor depression. I was mainly feeling overwhelmed and super emotional. I am so much calmer now and feel I can handle problems better that come my way. I have a slight decrease in appetite but at times I am actually hungrier. My gynaecologist said it would also help my hot flashes and it definitely has. The hardest thing about taking Pristiq is giving up my daily glass of wine. I feel it is best to follow the precautions totally. Overall this medicine has worked wonders on my emotional state."
