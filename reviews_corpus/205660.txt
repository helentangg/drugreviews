"I have avoided taking medication for my anxiety/depression for about 8 years. I have been on Pristiq for 5 weeks now. The first 8 days were difficult. I had inner shakiness and found it hard to concentrate.  I felt like I was off with the fairies.  I wanted to stopping the medication but the doctor did warn me that I may have side effects for 7-10 days so I decided to give it 14 days and I am glad I did.  For the first time in about 8 years I am the person I know I really am.  Loving, forgiving, understanding, positive and most of all excited about life.  Before this I was a nasty, negative person and stressed about everything. I blamed everything and everyone else for my life instead of taking personal responsibility."
