"I&#039;ve been on celexa for almost a month and I feel much better then before. I haven&#039;t noticed any side effects other then not sleeping more then four hours but that was me before I started celexa 20mg. I explained to my doctor about my sleep patterns and she wants to up my dose to 40mg and I&#039;m really not sure about that because I don&#039;t want the side effects of a higher dose. I still have little anxiety and mild depression but it&#039;s only been 3 weeks I think a little more time on 20mg I&#039;ll be back to me. I&#039;m also afraid if I go up in dose to 40mg will I lose my sex drive? I&#039;d rather not I&#039;m ok where I am. She said for me not to be afraid of it, example  it&#039;s like a blood pressure medication you have to adjust that works for you."
