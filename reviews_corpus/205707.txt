"I would like to thank everyone for leaving their comments on here. It is so helpful for everyone to stick together and help one another. Depression, anxiety, etc. is so hard to deal with and it is so comforting to know that you are not alone. I have tried Zoloft, which gave me such insanely scary nightmares that I was afraid to go to sleep. Effexor worked great for a while and then seemed to burn out. I tried countless other medicines over the years with no luck. I was on Pristiq for a few weeks and thought it was going to be yet another disappointment, then boom! I started feeling great. Also to my husband&#039;s delight, I have a pumped up sex drive, woo hoo! I didn&#039;t expect that one! I am so hoping this isn&#039;t too good to be true."
