"After experiencing severe anxiety from Wellbutrin, I started taking Zoloft 4 days ago while decreasing Wellbutrin.  While I think it will work with my brain chemistry, as I am already much more relaxed and easier to be around (no more snappishness), the eye dilation, sweats, nausea and general sick feeling aren&#039;t fun but expected.  Thanks for all the feedback from others.  It helps manage my expectations."
