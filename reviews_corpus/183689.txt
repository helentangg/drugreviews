"I was prescribed this for pain relief but I also suffer from anxiety and depression so we hoped it would help that as well. I was only on it for 3 days and ended up in hospital. The first day I couldn&#039;t stop being sick, the second day I felt really sick, was shaking and felt really spaced out, I couldn&#039;t eat or drink and yesterday I got even worse. It didn&#039;t help with my pain at all and I was more anxious than ever. I tried to get out of bed this morning and fell over. My husband took me to hospital and I was told not to take it anymore. I&#039;m 28 with 2 children and was unable to look after them while on this medicine."
