"I have been taking prozac,going on week 2 now. 
The symptoms are almost unbearable.  My stomach gets upset,can barely eat. I can&#039;t even sleep at all. It&#039;s like I am tired...but I can&#039;t sleep. And I feel tired all day. The one thing I can&#039;t stand...is the light headed feeling,and I am shaky all the time. It gets bad.....
I&#039;m about ready to throw this medication in the trash. The symptoms are almost as bad as my anxiety attacks. In fact...it makes it worse."
