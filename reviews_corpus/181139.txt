"I was prescribed 10mg fluoxetine for mild depression, mood swings, and anxiety due to menopause. ( Can not take HRT)   The third day started to experience terrible diarrhea for two days. About the fifth day it was absolutely the worst crying I have ever felt.  The feelings of despair where overwhelming.   
Needless to say I contacted my doctor and will not continue taking.  Hope it works better for someone else trying it."
