"I started a course of Lexapro around eight months ago. I suffer from major depression so I started out using 5mg, then up to 10mg and then 20mg. At first I felt a slight feeling of nausea that only lasted a few minutes. The other side effects I experienced were slight mania and decreased appetite. It helped me remain calm during pressure at work. I am now weening off escitalopram and am experiencing involuntary muscle contractions whilst entering sleep beyond R.E.M. I also find myself chomping my jaw sometimes and am having cold and flu symptoms along with an unusual head rush that left me a little bit disorientated. I am on my final days of escitalopram now, and I&#039;m sure side effects will diminish soon."
