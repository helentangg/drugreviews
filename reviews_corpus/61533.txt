"I&#039;m 23 years old and completly normal I suffer from anxiety which started making me feel very down in the dumps ( depressed). I started on 10mg 2 months ago and now feel great a lot more calm and back to my out going self. I suffered from some of the side effects for the first month such as insomnia and dizzyness and my symptoms did worsen at first but stick with it it does calm down in the end"
