"This medication has worked wonders for me. After reading the side effect reviews from others, I was worried. However, I made sure I ate a good protein breakfast with the medicine. I used the starter pack which ramps up the dosage slowly. I only had minor side effects and those lasted just a few days. 

I feel so much better now and am so glad I decided to take a chance with Viibryd. The biggest plus is no weight gain, which is common with other medicines for this condition."
