"I know I should wait about a month before sharing my experience, but I absolutely love this medication. I&#039;ve been on it for a week with nothing but good effects. Before this, I couldn&#039;t be around crowds without getting panicky and anxious. I was causing problems in my relationship out of anxiety. My sex drive has increased since this medicine eases the anxiety I get about my body. The only minor effects I&#039;m getting are very minor shakiness, which is hardly noticeable. I&#039;m also yawning a lot, but I&#039;m not tired. I also have a slight tightness in my throat, like the feeling you get while crying but it&#039;s not even prevalent anymore. I hope I keep reacting so well to this, I feel like a real person now, and I&#039;m not held back by my anxiety."
