"My psychologist originally suggested Lexapro to treat my anxiety and panic disorder, then my doctor prescribed it. I was told that it is not habit forming and that it has low side effects and works well to treat panic disorder. I started out on 10mg for 3 weeks then went up to 20mg. My side effects have been mild and have included nausea (the first few days), weight loss (which I don&#039;t mind) because of decreased appetite, mild increased sweating, and recently trouble falling asleep. All in all I am very pleased with it and have had only one panic attack in over a month. I used to have multiple ones weekly. I feel like I am finally getting my life back and I would recommend this medicine to anyone."
