"After 10 years of chronic abdominal pain, a bunch of tests, multiple doctors telling me to take ompeprazole with no relief I am now 90% pain free. I started taking Endep 1 week ago and have increased  to 20 mg. It makes me a little sleepy but I take it 2 hrs before bed anyway. My new doc narrowed it down to overactive nerves and she nailed it. I&#039;m now getting better quality of life and am happy that I have found this med. For me it&#039;s really worked well."
