"Male, 50, about 1 yr ago experienced sudden onset of debilitating generalized anxiety disorder.  Suffered 3 months trying benzodiazepines, Buspar, Wellbutrin and Lexapro 10 mg.  Settled on Lexapro 20 mg.  100% symptom-free in about 1 month.  After 1 year, tapered off about a month ago.  ZERO negative side effects from tapering and 100% recovery.  I&#039;m not one to suggest a miracle but this is about as close as it gets."
