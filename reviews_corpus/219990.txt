"I took this medicine for anxiety and panick attacks. After suffering for several months trying all sorts of medication. It was this old school medicine that gave me hope that i can actually recover. It improves my general health condition. But  i found it difficult to wake up from sleep while i was still on this medication.It really helps but did not address the symptoms permanently."
