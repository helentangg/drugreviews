"My doctor switched me to duloxetine from citalopram in October. I was doing fine on the citalopram, but my doc thought this would be better due to anxiety and some chronic pain due to a car accident. I hate this stuff. I do not have the horrible side effects that some people experience but I am getting headaches, trouble urinating, and mood swings. The hot flashes have subsided. I am on 60 mg. I want to go off of this. I&#039;ve called my doctor, but no call back yet. I want to be happy again. I want to go out with my husband and friends. Right now, my bed and home are my best friends. I&#039;m scared to go off of it. I&#039;ve heard nightmare stories. Please pray."
