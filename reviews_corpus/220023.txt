"I have been on amitrip for a few years now. At first, perhaps for 2 years, my migraines were less and I slept well. Now I&#039;m not sleeping well at all and often take a sleeping pill at 2 to 3 am. I&#039;m on 20mg but cut down to 15mg before Christmas. I was ok for a month then had 3 migraines in 3 weeks. So now I&#039;m back on 20mg but going to start on a course of 400mg ribiflavin hoping that will help the migraines and I can finally give up the amitrip.
Don&#039;t pay for medication. I&#039;m 70 this year."
