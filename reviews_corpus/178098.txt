"I started Cymbalta in December 2009 and I thought it worked wonders. My stepmom passed away in Jan of 2010 and it helped me get through it like an adult.  I used to cry all the time over everything but that has stopped.  It allows me to FEEL but not to be manic about it. I have to say the best thing about it though is the loss of appetite.  I was a chronic over-eater and was starting to really chub out.  Within 6 months of using this medication I lost 25 lbs.  
Unfortunately, for me, I got stubborn and tried to get off the medicine in January 2011.  I felt that I could just do okay without it. I was so wrong. Within 3 months I&#039;ve been depressed, sad, manic, and gained back 10lbs! I started the medicine again yesterday. Wish me luck!"
