"Was on Zoloft and then Effextor (150 mg) and did great on both, but because I am a long-term forever user I needed to change it up -weaning from the effexor was so horrible.  I am now taking 10 mg and it&#039;s been a week. I am experiencing sleep disruption, some nausea, I am now VERY regular and my joints and muscles are stiff and sore.  I am finally seeing a glimmer of hope as far as my despair goes - so I am optimistic that the above side affects will go away and all will be well in my world again in a few weeks."
