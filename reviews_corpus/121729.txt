"I&#039;ve had intense hot flashes for 12 years. In addition to HRT (which worked fabulously during the 5 years I was on it), I tried Zoloft, Prozac, Remifemin, and Estroven with varying degrees of unspectacular success. So didn&#039;t expect much from Effexor, but within days of starting daily 37.5 dose, my hot flashes all but disappeared. Really, it&#039;s amazing. I&#039;ve only been on it two weeks, so here&#039;s hoping it&#039;ll be effective for the long haul, which at this point, after 12 years, is looking like it will be the rest of my life. Geez, thanks, mom..."
