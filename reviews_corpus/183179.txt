"I&#039;ve been on this for a few months for depression and anxiety. I was on Celexa for 25 years, but I also have acute bursitis and bone pain from Hashimoto&#039;s disease so my Doctor switched me to Cymbalta. The first week I ended up in the hospital, the transition was AWFUL I was miserable and I had severe migraines. Everything smoothed out just fine and I was actually surprised at how much it did improve my bone pain and acute bursitis. I came to this site to see side effects that people are having because in the last two weeks I am finding that I am having really bad anxiety attacks at night, even while I&#039;m sleeping; they wake me up. I had four episodes last week and another last night."
