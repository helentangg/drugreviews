"I&#039;m 10 days into my treatment, the hospital started me on 30mg then told me to increase the dose to 60mg after 7 days.  So far, so good.  I have to say that I&#039;m getting on well with the drug but I&#039;m experiencing some insomnia and so take Valium for that (around 10mg).  

I hope that as time goes on and my dose of cymbalta increases that this drug continues to work and and I feel even more of its benefits as I want to start reducing the Valium at some point in the future. 

I&#039;m in the UK and so do not pay for this drug and as my Doctor has certified me as being unfit for work, I don&#039;t have to pay for any medication at all."
