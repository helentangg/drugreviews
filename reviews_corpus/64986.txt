"I started taking Zoloft in 1993 after 5 years of intense suffering from anxiety which led to depression. I had relentlessly recurring unpleasant thoughts that I could not control, starting from just a moment after I&#039;d wake up in the morning and continuing all day, leaving me exhausted. The demands of my first professional job and impending marriage broke me and I finally agreed to use medication. I went on 50mg and after 3 weeks it felt like a miracle occurred. I put my troubles behind me and immediately got on with life. I still had breakthrough anxiety and had lots of supplemental meds over the years, such as Buspar and Trazodone, and Zoloft to 75,100,150 mg. I settled on 100mg 10 years ago. I use Clonazepam rarely when it gets intense."
