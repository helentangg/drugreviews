"At age 30 obgyn prescribed Sarafem for PMDD.. made a huge difference.. went through life changing events, a death, divorce, and was at the bottom and had quit taking the medicine. Symptoms got worse at age 50 changed obygyns (had no issues with my 1st obgyn, but just wanted a female dr) and she read me the riot act.. Pre-menopause.. and last yr confirmed menopause. It absolutely makes a huge difference in my life. I laugh every day. Don&#039;t stop taking it if you have no side effects. I don&#039;t fly off the handle still get moody occasionally, but nothing more than a little venting with a friend can&#039;t cure."
