"I was only prescribed amitriptyline a week ago. I used it for the first time on Monday night and my experience was horrible. I felt like I had no control over my body, it really was a trip. I felt almost paranoid because of it and the dry mouth (which my doctor warned me about) was unpleasant. I made up my mind that I would rather go back to Xanax or lorazepam for my Depression and recently diagnosed PTSD."
