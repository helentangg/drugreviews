"Amitriptyline give me a good sleep every night, I take 1x10mg 2 hrs before sleep. Also the tablet takes away any aches and pains on your body. 
A cure for panic attacks for which I used to have 6 approx a month is : Stop drinking Coffee or Tea unless you change it to Decaffinated only and the other cure that helps is : 4 or more cups of Camomile Tea every day ,no sugar and no milk in it. I normally leave the t-bag in the cup until I have drunk it.
All these things have worked for me and I have not had any Panic attacks for approx 3 years.
Also if you suffer with Policeman&#039;s heel while walking, the only cure for that is : Sketcher&#039;s Shape-ups, I have been wearing them  for years and my pain has completely disappeared, I buy mine on line."
