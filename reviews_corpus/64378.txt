"I thought I was going crazy. I developed PPD at 3 months postpartum. My symptoms manifested in Anxiety. I had zero control over the fear and panic. I stopped eating, I threw up all day. I couldn&#039;t even hold my baby without feeling nausea.  You hear so much about postpartum depression but women need to be aware of postpartum anxiety. It&#039;s very real. It took 4 trips to the ER for me to accept that I wasn&#039;t dying, that I just had PPD and I needed to give my Zoloft a chance. It saved my life! Zoloft is so wonderful. It gave my children their mother back. Zoloft will take your anxiety away. It will! My side effects were very little. But then they went away. Iv only been on Zoloft for 2 months now and I&#039;m a better person then ever before."
