"As someone that HATES crowds &amp; dealing with people in general, Zoloft seems to be helping. I have also tried Lexapro, which caused horrible weight gain &amp; total numbness when it came to feelings. Zoloft has been doing the opposite...my appetite is pretty much non-existent. So far, I wouldn&#039;t say I&#039;m having any major side effects &amp; im overall happy with everything."
