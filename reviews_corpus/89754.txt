"I was on 100mg of Zoloft a day for 6 years and suddenly my depression symptoms were coming back quickly.  When I spoke to my Doctor, she suggested Cymbalta or Abilify as a supplement to the Zoloft, but as I am uninsured, they were way too expensive. She suggested we try Celexa and I weaned off of the Zoloft while slowly increasing the dosage of the Celexa to 20mg.  So far, so good.  I actually wish I had been taking it all along, because I have more energy, have actually lost some of the weight I gained on Zoloft, and the sexual side effects are not nearly as bad as the Zoloft.  Everyone is different, but I highly recommend it."
