"With peri menopause leading to menopause...came an overwhelming sadness, emotional ups and downs, anger, the black dog visited often for no apparent reason.  After seeing doctor who offered blood tests acknowledged menopause was occurring, he prescribed  pristiq 50 mg. one a day. I had negative pre conceived ideas about taking anti depressants due to incorrect information but thought I&#039;d give it a try. It&#039;s now nearly three years since I began treatment....yes ...they work....side effects :can numb emotions, but not to the point that I can&#039;t feel..loss of libido..that&#039;s a small price to pay compared to how I felt when the black dog  visited. I tried to stop taking pristiq only to have old symptoms return"
