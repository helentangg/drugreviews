"I have been on Pristiq for 2 weeks now and was prescribed this medicine for severe depression and anxiety. To be honest, I am not sure if I feel any positive benefits or not. I do know, Pristiq has done nothing for the anxiety which has pretty much ruled my life for months now. I am hoping eventually this medicine will help me deal with the anxiety. I do have a small dose of Xanax to be taken as needed but, I would really like to avoid taking it. As for side effects, I had the nausea initially, not so much now. I do notice I have to be near a bathroom at all times due to frequent urination. Weight loss has not been significant but, I lost a lot prior to taking this medicie and haven&#039;t gained so, that is a plus."
