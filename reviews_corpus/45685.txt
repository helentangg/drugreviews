"Sarafem should be in the water. Have suffered from depression my whole life. Never knew how bad it was until I started to take Sarafem. Started at 20mg I am at 40mg today. Have tried to decrease dose or come off completely, usually blaming weight gain &amp; tiredness on it, but it was not worth it. Very little weight gain and my tiredness never went away. I have been on Sarafem for over 10 years. If anything it saved my marriage! Take each night before bed &amp; have the script written for the brand name...there is a difference!"
