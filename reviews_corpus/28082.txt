"Was once on Lexapro 20mg many years ago. Stopped taking because of pregnancies. Been 20 months since my youngest was born and started to struggle badly. I finally caved in and went back in them. Have been on them now 12 days and still get a bit of nausea and always tired. Constant yawning. But mentally I have been great! I do feel a little dull in the emotions part but to be honest its better than it was before. Hopefully the side effects subside :)"
