"I only took this medicine once. The 1st night I was very anxious and unable to sleep plus my pulse
rate was irregular and fast. Decided to just use Xanax for difficulty sleeping and no side effects. Citalopram was prescribed to me for insomnia and anxiety after my husband died unexpectedly. Following side effects of Citalopram tried Zoloft."
