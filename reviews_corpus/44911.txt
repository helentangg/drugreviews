"Been on fluoxetine for five weeks. For the first month I had no side effects and  after the first two weeks I experienced a very slight improvement in my anxiety. In the last week I have had some negative side effects very similar to that of a fever; including sweating, sore throat, hard to breathe, trouble sleeping, dehydration, complete lack of appetite, dizziness, shaking and confusion. Possibly the worst side affect was the distorted vision - shakey with little perception of depth, slightly like being drunk. I hope that the side effects subside soon."
