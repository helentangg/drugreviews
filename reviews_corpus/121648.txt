"I really love the outcome of venlafaxine er and I&#039;m currently on 225mg and I was diagnosed 2 years ago with Dysthymia and it&#039;s helped a whole lot for me and it&#039;s helped me make a positive turnaround and meeting the love of my life. I would definitely recommend effexor (venlafaxine) I feel like a new person."
