"Life changer. I am so grateful I finally broke down and decided to get help with my anxiety. after all it was so bad I was having panic attacks everyday. I wasn&#039;t myself anymore and constantly was worried and sensitive to everything. I was annoying myself and I&#039;m sure annoying other people. I was starting to recluse myself. I had horrible chest pains and was so worried I would have a heart attack. Now after 2 weeks I feel amazing, back to my old self again. No panic attacks and have finally reclaimed my life back. I&#039;m happy bc I am able to go to the store now and not be anxious. It&#039;s so wonderful. No side effects and I am very clear headed now as well - no brain fog!!"
