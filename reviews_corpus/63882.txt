"Been on 25mg for about 5 weeks. Nothing changing so I&#039;m taking 37.5mg--1-1/2 pills. Just on my 4th day. And still not noticing anything. Had dry mouth for a few days, and my sleep is a little restless. 
Suffered from this depression going on 8 years. I&#039;m 32 years old. I&#039;ve heard that 50mg is the therapeutic dose. 
So that&#039;s where I&#039;m headed, I&#039;m determined to beat this. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Also I&#039;ve been so scared of side effects, especially falling deeper into this abyss of sadness and loneliness. But I must prevail."
