"I am a 45 year old male who tore major muscle groups in the right side of my back and neck 23 years ago. I have suffered horribly since then. I have had surgeries but the pain was still bad after. The first breakthrough was Lyrica as it addressed the nerve pain. Now, it appears Cymbalta may have dealt with the remainder of the nerve pain. It has only been a week but I have cut back on Lyrica and feel only 10% of the pain I once had. If I can survive this ungodly string of opening side effects (sweating, anxiety, weakness, nausea, constipation, dizziness) things may end up OK after all this time. Due to comments on this forum, I am going to ignore the side effects and wait until they go away. If they do go away, then Cymbalta is amazing."
