"I have been on amitriptyline for almost one year.  I was hesitant to take a daily medication and something that was for depression, which I did not feel I needed.  This medication has been a God send for me.  I have gotten maybe 3 headaches since I have been on it, one severe and the others mild.  I have not had weight gain.  I am able to lead a normal life now whereas before my activities depended on whether I had a headache or not."
