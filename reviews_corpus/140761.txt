"After taking Citalopram for over 12 years I started suffering from sivere anxiety side-effects.  My GP suggested that we try Effexor.  After 3 months on Effexor, my anxiety was no better and I had one little trip to the ER and a short stay in hospital with another failed suicide attempt.

I was in a really bad place, at the end of my wits.  My pharmacist had a chat with me.  He said that seeing as I had responded so well to the Citalopram initially, it might be worth trying es-citalopram/Lexapro.

I talked to me Dr. and he agreed.

Things have been a lot better since.  I don&#039;t need any anxiety medication at the moment and most of my other symptoms are a lot more manageable.

It is not a cure, but it makes the symptoms bearable."
