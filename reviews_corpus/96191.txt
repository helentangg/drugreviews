"I started taking sertraline last night for severe depression and anxiety. I can honestly say that within 1 hour of taking it I felt a little better (anxiety had gone) and my mood lifted albeit slightly, today I feel slightly nauseous  and a little anxious. Just praying that it works on me as it has on others I&#039;ve read on here. Tried pretty much everything else so we&#039;ll see, first signs are good."
