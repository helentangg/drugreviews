"For 25 years I suffered with migraines with aura, numbness in my hands, face, + nausea etc. I tried everything the doctors suggested, &amp; avoided triggers. I haven&#039;t eaten chocolate in 32 years, never eat bananas, &amp; I&#039;ve never had red wine. In 1997, a neurologist prescribed 100mg of Pamalor, and 500mg of Naproxen 2x a day. It completely changed my life. I now stay away from the obvious triggers, &amp; take 50mg a night(75 during my periods) &amp; 250mg naproxen. I get migraines about 5x a year now, &amp; use Imitrex then). I&#039;ve taken it for 18 years &amp; would like to ween off of it. I don&#039;t like the heart concerns associated with it, constipation, nor the weight gain. I exercise daily, maintain a 1200 cal diet, &amp; still gain weight.. 50 lbs in 18 years."
