"I have been taking this for 2 years now and it has been the best thing to happen to me. It was only when I had had bad suicidal thoughts that my doctor finally realized I had bipolar. They just kept saying I was depressed but to be fair I never told them how bad it was until I had a complete breakdown. After being admitted to the hospital I had to speak to a Councillor and was a few seconds away from being sectioned under the mental health act that they realized I was worse than what I was originally saying. Venlafaxine has made my life and my kids life better. I am on 225mg per day 75mg night and 150mg mornings."
