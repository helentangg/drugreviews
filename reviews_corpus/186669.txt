"I have been taking Pristiq for about three weeks now and it&#039;s been fantastic! I just feel normal again. I feel like I am back to my old happy, friendly self. I no longer feel panicked when I am in a very social situation and I&#039;m not scared to try new things anymore. Overall I just feel very balanced. I can deal with stressful situations and get over them a lot more quickly. I don&#039;t dwell on them all day. I&#039;m also a lot less cranky."
