"I have been stricken with IBS-C for about 9 months. Have been through multiple GI&#039;s like most people with this syndrome, went through every test - to no avail. Bloating started as soon as I woke up and lasted all day with severe constipation every day. Have been on the SCD/FODMAP diet for the past 6 months, without much relief. My new GI prescribed this drug. I am taking a much higher dose than the other posters - 50mg once per night. This has given me SIGNIFICANT improvement - I would say at least 75% better. I am able to expand my diet now, and bloating is virtually non existent, even with those new foods. This has been a life changer. I do have the trouble urinating side effect, but only in the morning waking up. Rest of the day is fine."
