"Stick with the medicine, it truly does take 6-8 weeks for your body to adjust. I take 75mg in the morning (keeps me up at night with RLS) and my anxiety is under control and I am able to go on with life and my day to day activities. The side effects I had in the beginning of being tired, RLS, yawning excessively...did go away with time and now I experience none of those things."
