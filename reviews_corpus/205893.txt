"I have major depression. Also I have a spinal fusion.I have tried many depression drugs. I also suffer from a sleep disorder that makes me sleep through a lot of the day. With Pristiq I definitely feel better in the morning and that was the worst time of day for me. I am still suffering from excessive sleepiness during the day. I have been on Pristiq for about three months now. So far its been pretty good. I would recommend it, but it is not a miracle drug for me. I still have depression.I was hoping for a bigger difference."
