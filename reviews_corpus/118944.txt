"I&#039;ve been taking Zoloft for a little over a year. It has been very effective for controlling my symptoms (I have GAD). Now I&#039;m able to concentrate on my college classes, and in general stopped feeling anxious about different events and situations (exams, trips far away, driving a car, etc).
I started with 12.5mg and took that each morning for 6 months or so, without side effects. Then it stopped working well (the minor, yet bothersome, anxiety episodes came back), so I increased the dose to 25mg, and now am on 37.5mg, and doing good so far. 
Usually, I am sensitive to medications, so it was a nice surprise that Zoloft did not affect me negatively. Thanks to Zoloft, I feel like a different, more confident and more calm person now."
