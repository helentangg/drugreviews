"I&#039;ve been on Paxil for about the past four years.  It helps stabilize my depression, which I&#039;ve had for many years.  It doesn&#039;t make me happy, but at least I can function and feel like a normal person.  It is one of two medications that have helped me at all (the other being Celexa, but that one made me gain extreme weight).  The only negative thing is that I gained some weight months after taking it.  Despite a few extra pounds, I&#039;ll keep taking it."
