"I started this medication via a sample pack about two months ago.  I went up to 20mg.  My Doctor thought that I should stay on it longer even though I felt it was doing nothing for me.  Now, after two months I have started having lower abdominal pain which turns into discomfort and pain again.  My bowels are all over the chart from the diarrhea to very slight constipation.  There is no rhyme or reason.  I also now have very uncomfortable boating.  I have a feeling of fullness in my lower abdomen, and had an ultra sound done by my OBGYN to se if I was having issues with my ovaries or uterus and that came back clean and clear.  I also have random nausea.  Sometimes early in the day, other times later on at night."
