"I was prescribed 30mg Cymbalta 3 months ago to treat hot flashes/sweats.  After just one pill, the hot flashes/sweats were gone.  Before I was having 7-8 sweats per day. Going on 4 months now and the hot flash/sweats are starting to slowly come back but they are still fewer than before.  I want to keep taking and will have a recheck next month to see if I should increase to 60mg.  All positive feedback so far."
