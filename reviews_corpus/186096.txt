"I am currently 21 years old, but started taking Pristiq a few years ago. I had previously tried Prozac, then Effexor, but I couldn&#039;t see much of a difference. Once I started taking Pristiq 50mg, I felt the results within the same week. It was great. However, whenever I missed a day I would feel the adverse side effects almost immediately. Brain zaps, depersonalization, dizziness, foggy thoughts, nausea, sweating, crying spells, headaches... I eventually got off of it (I honestly don&#039;t know how) but it was a very difficult 2-week process. Two years later I am back on wellbutrin (after a bad experience with lexapro). Pristiq was definitely effective but extremely addictive. Not something I&#039;d recommend without reservation."
