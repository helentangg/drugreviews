"I am so thankful for this medication ... after years of self medicating for untreated depression, anxiety, ADD and mild bi-polar and trying other antidepressants (Wellbutrin, Celexa and Effexor, which is supposedly similar to Pristiq but all gave me nasty side effects). I was given samples of Pristiq and decided to give it another try.  Within days I was back on the right track and feeling better.  Only side effects which went away quite quickly was mild nausea and loss of appetite. I have realized some people like myself, just need medications like Pristiq to live a somewhat &quot;normal&quot; life.... nothing to be ashamed of.  A diabetic needs insulin ... I need Pristiq.  Thank you for giving me my life back."
