"I&#039;ve been taking Viibrid for 5 weeks, and my mood seems to be much more stable. It&#039;s nice to not have constant feelings of despair. The one problem it&#039;s giving me is extreme nausea and vomiting. Even so, the positive effects from Viibryd are great and I&#039;m more than willing to keep taking it despite all the nausea."
