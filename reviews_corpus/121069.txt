"Prescribed 37.5mg xr once a day for anxiety. I read about people&#039;s experiences online and decided I&#039;d try it for a week before judging. I lasted five days before quitting due to side effects. Noticeable fatigue, no appetite, difficulty concentrating, waking up in the night and being unable to fall asleep again, constipation, gas. This is not for me and I am glad I didn&#039;t take it long enough to experience withdrawal symptoms. My hunger came back the day I stopped taking it."
