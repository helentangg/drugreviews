"I was prescribed this for vulvodynia after seeing 2 gynecologists with no clue what &quot;disease&quot; I &quot;had&quot;. My third gynecologist put me on 25mg each night, after a year of experiencing excruciatingly painful intercourse for no apparent reason. After just 2 weeks, Amitriptyline successfully took away the pain! I&#039;m so thankful for my gyno&#039;s knowledge of this drug and her shot into the dark on prescribing me this, despite it rarely being prescribed in an OBGYN clinic!"
