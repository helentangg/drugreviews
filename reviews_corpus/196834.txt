"I was prescribed Paxil for anxiety &amp; depression when I was 13. Initially, it did all it was promised with few side affects. Over the years it seemed to lose it&#039;s effectiveness, but I was afraid to come off it for fear I would be worse off. Finally started the process of weaning myself off it when multiple reports came out saying it was DANGEROUS and had multiple long term effects on teenagers. I had been taking it for nearly a decade. The withdrawals were the worst thing I have experienced in my life. Thought I was dying. My face and limbs didn&#039;t feel real. The &quot;zaps&quot;. I was nonfunctional, and this lasted months. Please use extreme caution and have someone closely monitor you when you decide to wean off this medication."
