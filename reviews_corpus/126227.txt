"I have been on the Viibryd for a month.  I have had NOTHING.  I feel no different than before I started.  No side effects and no change.  Recently, I have been on the 40mg for 2 weeks now and I cannot sleep and I wake up SOAKED in sweat. This is my first attempt at an antidepressant, so maybe it is not the right one for me."
