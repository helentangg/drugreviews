"After taking Zoloft (50 mg) for only a few days, I feel incredibly lucky to have had such a positive experience with it. For about an hour after I take it I get stomach cramps that resemble menstrual cramps, but after that I go into a really positive mood and I just want to tell everybody how much I appreciate them. I don&#039;t get sick from overthinking minor details anymore and all of my emotions feel more stable and controllable. I&#039;m experiencing slight restlessness and difficulty falling asleep, but I&#039;m taking that as a positive, as I feel like I got my energy back. I do clench my jaw at night now though. I have no appetite and I&#039;m losing weight, but I used to overeat due to anxiety so I don&#039;t mind it. I never thought I could be this happy."
