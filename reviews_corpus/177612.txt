"Was given 30mg cymbalta for pain in hip as well as depression due to chronic pain. It&#039;s been 2months, after about 3weeks of many side affects, diarrhea, nausea, headache, the  pharmacy told me to stick with it, they will pass. They have except I&#039;ve gained about 5lbs. The depression is better, the pain isn&#039;t any better, in fact seems to be getting worse. I don&#039;t think the cymbalta is making the pain worse, I think my hip is just getting worse. But not happy about the weight gain since I was fighting my weight before I took it. And being heavier can&#039;t be good for a bad hip."
