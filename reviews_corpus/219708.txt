"I fell in some grease and broke my back and herniated discs. I had surgery but was left with this crazy pain down my leg to my foot .  I tried pain injections, gabapentin and tramadol.  Of course I was depressed.  My doctor who always listens to me with all her attention said &ldquo; I&rsquo;m going to try Amitriptyline 20mg at bed .  I think it will help your depression and your pain.  She was 100% right, my leg feels great I stopped the gabapentin and only use the tramadol on a bad weather days.  It helps me sleep as well."
