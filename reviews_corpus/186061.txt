"I&#039;ve been diagnosed with Fibromyalgia for a few years now, was raised to 450 MG a day because my pain kept increasing. I had chronic fatigue, was DX with sleep apnea, have a CPAP mask and take all kinds medications just to be able to sleep. I kept having very bad days to where I could barely walk and would get very shaky and twitchy. Finally I was DX with severe depression and anxiety, and was prescribed Pristiq. From day one, it calmed down my anxiety and has taken away 90 to 95% of my pain, I have a ways to go in my depression but I&#039;m no longer confined to my bed. I&#039;ve been on it for almost a month now and absolutely love it, I have a little trouble with sleep some times but with my CPAP and sleep meds I&#039;m able to get great sleep."
