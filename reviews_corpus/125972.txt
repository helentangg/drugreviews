"I&#039;ve been on Viibryd for less than 2 months. My depression is gone and I handle my anxiety better, but I feel disconnected and confused 80% of the time. I forgot how to write a cheque and get hot water several times. I also become very shaky and I feel like nothing is real and it takes everything in me to stay sane. It&#039;s working and making me worse all at the same time and I&#039;m not sure if these side effects will go away or not, but I work a lot and I can&#039;t afford to not function. Viibryd is helpful and harmful to me right now and I&#039;m not sure what to do. I&#039;m going to stick with it for 12 weeks and if the negative side effects don&#039;t go away, I&#039;m going to switch."
