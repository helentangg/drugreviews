"I&#039;ve suffered with insomnia fire several years now.  At times sleeping only 1 hour before having to get up to go to work.  My Dr. prescribed Silenor but my insurance gave me Doxepin (25mg).  Biggest mistake I made was taking right before bed because it doesn&#039;t help you fall asleep, only helps you stay asleep.
Once I fell asleep, I didn&#039;t wake up at all until the following morning.  If you have children or anyone else to depend on you for care, I wouldn&#039;t recommend it.  I was actually awakened by my boys and I felt very drowsy, groggy, and irritable.  So much so that I caught myself yelling at my kids.  I wasn&#039;t able to function 100%.  This would ONLY be good if you have nothing to do or no-one to care for the next day. "
