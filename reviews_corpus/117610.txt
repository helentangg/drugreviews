"Started at 10mg &amp; pain lessened overnight! After few weeks, stepped up to 20mg, more improvement. In last few days upped to 30mg &amp; I am almost discomfort free. This is after suffering on &amp; off for some years. Plus my recurrent migraines  have stopped. And pain from both knee osteoarthritis &amp; wry neck very improved. So, yes, this medicine worked for me. Side effects were transient &amp; tolerable."
