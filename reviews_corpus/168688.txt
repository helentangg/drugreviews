"I have been on vybrid a week and a half. I have had a horrible experience with all side effects. It&#039;s making me sleep 14 hours with nightmares the whole time. In the starting dose of 10 mg. It helped for only two days.  By the fifth day I increased to 20 mg a day and things are not getting better. I&quot;m still anxious around people. I get depression still. And all it did was make my literally SICK. I stopped it today as I cannot take the side effects.  Seems pointless to keep taking something that is just making me feel sick and not myself.  I called my doc. Am waiting on a call back. I am going to try Zoloft again. It has helped a few times in the past and a few times it didn&#039;t help. But I&#039;m at the point I just cannot deal with vibrid anymore."
