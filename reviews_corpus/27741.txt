"Took this medication a little over a year ago. Terrible, terrible experience. Slept almost all day and when I wasn&#039;t asleep I was in constant panic to the point of tears. It&#039;s hard to remember a time in my life (even with anxiety and depression) where I cried more. I have found however that I am very sensitive to meds and so I&#039;m sure this was part of it. Would not touch it with a 10-foot pole."
