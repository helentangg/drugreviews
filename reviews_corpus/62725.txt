"After years of trying everything from self  medication to prescription drugs, Celexa has proven to be the best (for me). My marriage has been saved and countless friendships as well. I have no side effects on this medication and I love that. I have tried countless others and they either had terrible side effects or just did not work at all. I&#039;m not a bit sorry I tried it, and will stay on it, as I am tired of not feeling like a whole person without it."
