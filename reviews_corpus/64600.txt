"Best thing thy ever happened to me. Been taking it for a year and a half and can&#039;t even explain the unexplainable things it has done for me.
It has boosted my confidence tramendousely, it has given me a stronger, more independent mind set, reduced my panic attacks dramatically, reduced my feel for depression, it has given me the ability to be myself. You wouldn&#039;t understand how much of an improvement it&#039;s made as you didn&#039;t see how low of a place I was in, I was suicidal, depressed, angry, tired, panicky all day every day, until I finally found sertraline! Although the only problem is I get a bit drowsy some times but I believe that is involved with the smoking... But over all sertraline saved my life!! X"
