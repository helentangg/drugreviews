"I started on Lexapro about a week ago, and I&#039;ll give an update later but so far... WOW! Let me begin by adding that I&#039;m pregnant in my 3rd trimester and I&#039;ve had PTSD, severe anxiety, and depression for several years now.

I heard a lot of warnings about the first few weeks, the side effects that may occur, and might I just say I&#039;m lucky enough to have only one of them. That side effect being dry mouth which only lasts about an hour or 2 after taking it.

I take 50mg of Lexapro every night before bed and I feel so much better already. The tension I had previously felt In my chest is gone and I feel like I imagine a normal personal is supposed to feel. I used to be scared to go check my mail, but now I have no problems in public."
