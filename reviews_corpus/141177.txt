"Prior to starting Escitalopram I had been experiencing severe depression with suicidal ideation and went into the hospital to get help.  While I was there they put me on Escitalopram 10 mg 1x/day.  When I first started it I felt pretty doped up but I noticed I was starting to feel better not crying all the time and the thoughts to harm myself where starting to go away and now after 2 months of being on Lexapro I feel like a new person.  I feel better than I&#039;ve ever felt in my life.  I have energy to do things I enjoy and no fear to try new things.  I have a confidence I haven&#039;t felt before and an extremely positive outlook on life, I&#039;m almost too happy.  My only regrets is that I didn&#039;t go on it sooner."
