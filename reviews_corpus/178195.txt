"I started taking Cymbalta 6 months ago.  I know that they say this medicine can take about 3 weeks to kick in, however, I felt relief within hours of taking it.  Maybe it&#039;s some medical miracle or my body finally got what it needed.  I am a well educated woman who had a rough childhood.  I tried different anti-depressants over the years and never felt anything like this.  I stopped having suicidal thoughts.  The side effects were: loss of appetite and so tired that I had to lay down in the afternoon.  The only other medication I take is birth control.  I discovered the following:  If I take my birth control at night before bed and the 30mg Cymbalta in the morning then I&#039;m not tired.  The side effects went away by the 12th week so hang in there!"
