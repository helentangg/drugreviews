"I love this. I used to have major mood swings. I feel so much happier. I&#039;m a recovering meth addict. I started this medicine in rehab. 6 months at 50mg and life couldn&#039;t be better. All of the anxiety and nerves, tics and repetitive thoughts I no longer have. Pristiq and AA saved my life."
