"I have been using this medication for only 3 weeks now but have already started seeing good things from it. 
1)  I haven&#039;t cried since taking this medication when normally it would be at least 4 times a week. 
2)  I have literally stop worrying about what&#039;s going on at work
3)  I have not had a panic attack since taking it. 
4)  I have had some tiredness/drowsiness but it keeps me calm and focused.

The only negative for me is the constipation sort of. Just not as regular as I have been but who cares with everything else it has given me."
