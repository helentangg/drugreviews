"These were awful for me!!  At first I felt like a zombie. I&#039;ve lost all  all intrested and motivation to do anything!  I&#039;m extremely irritable and have pretty well yelled at everone I&#039;ve talked to. I feel I don&#039;t have any control. The only thing I want to do is sleep for 48 hours straight. I&#039;ll take a week with no sleep over this thanks!"
