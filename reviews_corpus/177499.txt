"Awful awful medicine!! Started take 30 mg once a day for Chronic pain at day 19 I had horrible heart palpitations my Dr suggested I get off the medicine by taking one every other day. I tried that after taking one then skipping a day the next day I took another which gave me an awful migraine! I have imitrex for migraines but couldn&#039;t take it because in was on cymbaltia so I suffered though a 24 hour migraine! I had to just stop talking it at this point. I&#039;ve had awful electrocution feeling in my brain for 10 days!! I&#039;m enraged and I&#039;m never like this! Awful, awful drug the people that made this should b ashamed of themselves!!!"
