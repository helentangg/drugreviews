"Since my diagnosis of acute bipolar disorder I&#039;ve been getting severe migraines almost constantly, or if there was a short respite, it lasted only hours. I was put on a self-titrating dose of amitripyline by my GP and at around 50-60mg daily I was getting no migraines. However, I found that several weeks after finding my &#039;correct&#039; dose, I was finding myself in constant anhedonia and ennui. I&#039;m now off the amitriptyline, and my migraines have returned, but my mood is back to normal."
