"Prozac worked Well for me with No serious complications or bad side affects. A plus for me,was very good memory! I used this medication for over 20 years and wish I was still able to use it. The only problem I did have
 with Prozac was at the end of 20
 years, I started getting terrible, horrible,  headaches. So
 bad that I would cry! I no longer can take any SSRI&#039;s and or any benzodiazepines. I think maybe after so many years your body isn&#039;t able to tolerate it. I began having severe breathing problems! I&#039;m now on the trial &amp; error time again, which most of us know that it isn&#039;t fun. Good luck to everyone."
