"I was prescribed Paxil for three conditions: Anxiety, Depression and OCD. The OCD was only diagnosed a month ago. 
One of the biggest issues I had with Paxil was that the side effects were a living nightmare for the first 20 days or so... We&#039;re talking about nasty trips, confusion, dizziness, fatigue. You name it. I probably suffered it and more. 

The actual use of Paxil as a form of treatment has been hit and miss. By treating my OCD, I noticed my depression was getting worse. 
On days where my depression was better my Anxiety would flare up. It was like trying to balance each condition and either way one was going to be playing up.

I am now using Paxil in conjunction with other medications for my issues and have to admit this has helped"
