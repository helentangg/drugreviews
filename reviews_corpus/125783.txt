"I was on this med for about 2 months.  During that time I started losing my hair and ended up losing quite a bit of it especially on the frontal part.  It did give me more energy but I also had a hard time keeping my anxiety in check.  I don&#039;t remember having the customary side effects and my body seemed to tolerate it quite well.  If it hadn&#039;t been for the hair loss and anxiety issues, I probably would have stayed on it.  I decided to go back on Paxil again a couple of days ago because I really had few problems with that except for weight gain if I don&#039;t watch myself."
