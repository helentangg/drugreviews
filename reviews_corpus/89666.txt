"Celexa worked wonders for my postpartum depression.  My depression stated later than normal, my child was 9 months.  At first I felt &quot;out of it&quot;, like I couldn&#039;t concentrate.  After a week that went away.  I also have mild OCD and it helped that too.  I did gain a little weight and was craving food more.  My husband says he noticed a good change in me, better mood."
