"I was always mad and very anxious. When I would think about any situation my heart would race and I would feel all panicky. At times I even would have suicidal thoughts. I&#039;ve been taking Lexapro for 1 month and feel great. I enjoy life and am not always stressing. I don&#039;t get anxiety and have no suicidal feelings. The only side effect I have is I&#039;m not sleeping so heavy. I still suffer from OCD but I&#039;m trying to have more control."
