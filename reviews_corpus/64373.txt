"My life has changed in so many positivecways since trying Setraline three months ago. The side effects were hard but only lasted the first 3 weeks or so. I felt tired But couldn&#039;t sleep, upset stomach, feeling out of it, clenching my jaw at night, weight loss due to no appetite. But after the first month all of that went away. I then felt happy everyday. My mood evened out. I don&#039;t feel upset over things or have anxiety. I&#039;ve become more outgoing. I wish I would have tried this year&#039;s ago. Just try not to miss any pills. I take mine in the morning. At first I read so many bad reviews I almost gave up on it but I&#039;m so glad I didn&#039;t."
