"I have only been on this medicine for 1 week. Still on 10mg. Went cold turkey off 30mg of Lexapro. Not seeing a big difference yet in the depression but after going off the high dose of Lexapro I expect to not see a difference in my depression yet. What I wanted to share was that I have itching skin. I just want to scratch and scratch. I&#039;m sure it will go away. I&#039;m hoping to have wonderful news on my next post regarding the depression and hopefully some weight loss too."
