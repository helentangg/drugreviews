"I suffer with chronic social anxiety disorder and bouts of severe depression. I&#039;m very sensitive to drugs and after trying many SSRI&#039;s I couldn&#039;t tolerate the side effects beyond the first week or two. A doctor recommended Escitalopram at 20mg. The drug has been amazing at reducing my anxiety and completely removing depression. Side effects in the first few weeks were rather unpleasant. I came up with a way of eliminating them by increasing the dosage gradually 2.5mg every week eventually stopping at 15mg. This gradual approach allows your brain chemistry to adjust more naturally I&#039;d recommend it. Before I started my depression was so bad I was suicidal and had no interest in anything. Escitalopram gave me my life back almost immediately."
