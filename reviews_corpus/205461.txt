"I found my experience on Pristiq to be similar to when I was on Effexor XR.  They are very similar medicines.  I switched to Pristiq after I wasn&#039;t getting the relief from depression and anxiety anymore on Lexapro and Xanax.  Unfortunately, I&#039;ve had to discontinue the Pristiq after about 6 months.  It does help with depression but it was making me easily agitated/irritable and I&#039;ve had considerable weight gain.  I would take it in the morning and often have thoughts of suicide by the time i went to bed.  I have switched back to Lexapro but just added Wellbutrin XL and switched my anxiolytic to longer acting Klonopin.  I&#039;ve read this is a great combo and hope it works! Good luck everyone."
