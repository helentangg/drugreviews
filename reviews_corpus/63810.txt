"I was given this medicine for depression and anxiety. I have experienced no negative side effects in the 6 years that I have taken Sertraline (Zoloft). Compared to others like it, this one has been the best fit for me. Before taking Sertraline, I tried Prozac, but hated feeling nauseated constantly. The only negative thing about this drug is that after a couple years, I notice that I have to go up a dosage because it seems less effective. I will notice my anxiety and depression more so than usual, but it is easily fixed with an increase. I started out at 50-100 mg, shortly being bumped up to 150 mg a day. Now, I am taking 200 mg a day and have been for over a year and a half. Overall good experience."
