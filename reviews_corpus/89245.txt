"Started on prozac 20mg but went off because of low libido. Doctor had me try Celexa 20mg &amp; it was the worst month of my life. So many side effects! Not only did my libido get worse, but I had frequent urination, depression worsened, sleeping pattern messed up, fatigue, always sweating, and it made my period disappear for 3 months &amp; I wasn&#039;t pregnant! After a month I went back to Prozac, I couldn&#039;t deal with celexas horrible side effects anymore!"
