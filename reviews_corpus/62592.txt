"I have been on all sorts of medications in the past, so I was nervous about starting down the anti-depressant path.  However I have been taking citalopram for about two years and have had the best results of any medication.  For the first time, my anxious mind is quiet. No longer am I kept awake at night replaying the day and worrying about it.  I still feel all the highs and lows of life, and aside from finding orgasm more difficult and perspiring a lot during exercise, I have no side effects.  I feel completely like myself and I am so pleased to have this medicine."
