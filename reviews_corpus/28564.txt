"Lexapro helped me a lot with my anxiety disorder / ADD symptoms ... The only thing is that Lexapro alone was not super effective for me, but when combined with Adderall and Klonopin it works amazingly -- none of the three medicines alone worked particularly well, but all three together work extremely well for anxiety, ADD and insomnia."
