"I started taking Paxil about 7 or 8 years ago for anxiety.  I had been in the hospital for an arrythmia at age 24 and it totally freaked me out.  After that, every illness I had I was sure it was my heart and I started to panic and check my pulse frequently. I ended up in the ER about twice a month thinking I was dying. My PCP finally suggested Paxil.  Since then I have had ZERO panic/anxiety attacks.  I have had problems occasionally with ejaculatory dysfunction, but not often enough for me to be that upset.  Besides, the trade-off is feeling better and living normally. It has been great for me and I hope you have a similar experience."
