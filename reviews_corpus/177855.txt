"After 5 years on Cymbalta, I cannot say enough about its effectiveness. I really can&#039;t speak to the claims of pain relief, but as far as depression and anxiety, it&#039;s the best I can recommend. The insurance has tried several times to get my Dr to prescribe Celexa, or Effexor, but neither work like Cymbalta. Initially, I was a little spacy, and jittery, but those went away with time. I&#039;d hate to have to pay for it as is. But, overall, I&#039;d rather not take anything than to have to switch."
