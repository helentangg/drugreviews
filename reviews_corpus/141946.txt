"I took this medicine about 2 years ago for anxiety and depression for about 3 months.  I could feel the effects of it in just 2 or 3 days and it made me feel like a complete zombie.  I had no personality and I kept catching myself sitting there and in a daze.  It also caused me to be very drowsy all the time."
