"I love Celexa and am grateful that it works for me. After my 1st panic attack in May 07, my doctor put me on zoloft. At first I liked it because it really helped with the anxiety immediately. I then noticed it made me feel like a zombie, the lows weren&#039;t as low, but there were not any highs anymore either. I had a few bouts of &quot;rage&quot; as well. After getting pretty depressed this winter 07-08, I went back to the doctor and it was actually the nurse practitioner who changed my medicines to Celexa. I was on 20 mg for 2 weeks and then she increased it to 40 mg. I have been on the 40 mg of Celexa now for 2 months and have never felt better. I am calm and happy but still feel like my funny self."
