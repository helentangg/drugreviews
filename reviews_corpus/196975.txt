"I been on paroxtine for 3 months and i love it i call it my happy pills. Taking for anxiety and premenopause symptoms.  Paroxetine help me alot i feel like a new person. First week was rough. headaches after the first week i was feeling good. I take them at night which fits my schedule. Everyone is different. If your on paroxetine and only suffer with minor side effects. Stick with them the side effects go away."
