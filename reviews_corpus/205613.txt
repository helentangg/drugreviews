"This drug has been a miracle for me.  I take it with Abilify (5 mgs) - and it has been a God-send.  I was on a triple combination of Cymbalta, Welbutrin and Abilify and still did not feel well.  Pristiq has helped me tremendously from within a week of onset.  I have struggled with depression since 1991 - and have been on a variety of &quot;cocktails&quot; but this one is working the best so far.  I still struggle with sleep and anxiety - as I have problems with Doctors treating my anxiety disorder as it should be.  Interesting that physicians will treat some things an not others.  My only complaint is lacking in sleep - other wise I would recommend this medicine to anyone struggling with depression."
