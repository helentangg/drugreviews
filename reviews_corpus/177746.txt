"Wow. Cymbalta changed my LIFE! Prozac made me a zombie, as did Paxil, Xanax &amp; Klonopin. I have depression &amp; anxiety. Prozac seemed to have made my depression worse! But then...Cymbalta saved me. I&#039;m so happy to be able to actually GET OUT of bed, not yell at the kids, etc. I experienced a mild euphoria at first, now, (it&#039;s been a week) I just feel happy and energetic! I really hope it keeps working!!"
