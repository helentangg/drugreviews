"For the past 4 years this medication has been great to me. I was prescribed this because I have had horrible TMJ. At night this would ease my pain. It would also relax my jaw enough to sleep and not have clenching and grinding. I&#039;ve only had 2 problems taking it. It has gave me nightmares and it makes me so sleepy that I rarely get out of bed on time the next day. But all in all it has helped me."
