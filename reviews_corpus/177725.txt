"I started taking Cymbalta about 6 months ago, and I&#039;m finally starting to feel better. I have chronic lower back pain, and have previously been prescribed Hydrocodone/Tramadol, which basically was like putting a carrot on a string for my brain to be preoccupied. The only down fall I have experienced is the terrible night sweat. Is there any relieve from it?"
