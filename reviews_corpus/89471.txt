"Day 4 of Celexa &amp; WOW my negative thoughts, constant worry &amp; irritation have almost vanished! I&#039;m taking 10mg a day and am amazed at how quickly I feel this medicine working. I have had some bad headaches, dizziness &amp; a little nausea but that&#039;s about it &amp; totally worth it for the difference I&#039;m feeling. I feel like life is worth living again. Thank you Celexa!"
