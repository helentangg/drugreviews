"I&#039;ve suffered from migraines since my daughter was born in 1967.  I was prescribed Cafergot to take at start of headache.  It worked well for each attack, but had a lot of side effects.  I would get migraine episodes from once a week to 3 or 4 times a week.  While employed, I would have to go to the ladies lounge and rest for the period it too to alleviate the pain.  Then my blood pressure got out of control, thereby creating another problem.  I was having a lot of nausea and vomiting also.  After retiring at 50, a new doctor prescribed Amytriptilyne.  Recently a new doc took me off it and migraine returned with a vengeance. I&#039;m now taking Nortriptyline and it has worked wonders!  No more migraine at all."
