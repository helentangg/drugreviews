"This is one of the few drugs that actually work for me. If you&#039;re attentive it&#039;s unlikely you&#039;ll run into trouble. If it improves life, it&#039;s worth it. We get into 2-ton things of steel and drive them around on the freeway super fast every day. Much riskier than taking parnate. I got off for a while and friends and family all insisted I stop trying new meds and remain on parnate for good. No side effects. Easy to quit for a minute when dental work and surgeries come up. Some times it feels like the market buries the best meds for some reason. Weird."
