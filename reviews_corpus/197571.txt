"I had really bad panic-attacks, and couldn&#039;t go very far from my home, it was aweful. I was a wreck. I have taken Paxil for about 8 years. Before taking it, I had tried many other anti-anxiety/anti-depressants, with no luck. Paxil along with my faith in God, gave me my life back. I would highly recommend!"
