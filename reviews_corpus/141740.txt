"If you are experiencing any symptoms of PMS, PMDD, or pre-menopausal symptoms, you may want to consider Lexapro. It has made such a significant change for the better in my life. I was beginning to think there was nothing that could help me or my husband and then a co-worker suggested Lexapro and I am so grateful she did. No mood swings, hot flashes, irritability and no more cold hands. My hands would get so cold and the rest of me would be going through a hot flash so I could never get comfortable but since I&#039;ve been on Lexapro, none of the above mentioned symptoms are a problem any longer."
