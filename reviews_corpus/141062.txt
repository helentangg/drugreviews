"I was prescribed 10mg of Escitalopram for anxiety/depression and took half a pill for a week to get started. I have had IBS my whole life (diarrhea right after eating or several times a night/day) which morphed into severe gas and bloating with the onset of my depression and anxiety due to work related stress.  I felt great after 2 weeks, very zen and not irritable or unhappy and unexpectedly my IBS symptoms also improved significantly (though bloating never fully went away). I was told it could make your stomach upset which worried me but I had no symptoms except very low libido. Due to the low libido, I decided to stop taking it but with in 1-2 weeks of stopping, the IBS bloating is back."
