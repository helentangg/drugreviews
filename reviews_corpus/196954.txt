"This medication has almost gotten rid of my anxiety. I was suffering for 2 years till I decided to go on medication. My doctor put me on 20mg of paroxatine and I noticed a difference in 2 weeks. I was able to go to the shops without feeling like I was going to have a panic attack. I&#039;ve been on it for 6 months now and I can eat out in public sometimes which is a huge step for me as I was too scared to even think about food before. I would reccomend this to anyone who is desperate to get out of their anxiety. I feel so much happier and can enjoy life so much more now. The only problem I have with this medication is it has made me gain 20kg of weight! I&#039;m trying hard to lose it but it is very hard to lose."
