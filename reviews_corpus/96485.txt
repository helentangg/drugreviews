"I have only been taking Zoloft for 5 days. Have not been as anxious or worried the past couple of days. I do take it in the morning so I do not have trouble sleeping. I do find that if I am tired during the day and want to take a nap, I can&#039;t sleep. The only other side effects so far are constant stomach upset and occasional diarrhea.  Hopefully these will subside, if not may have to switch to a different medicine.  Hopefully there will be no weight gain, as that would not be good."
