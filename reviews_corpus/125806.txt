"I&#039;ve been battling MDD for 20 years. I&#039;m 32. If you can name it, it&#039;s been prescribed to me. I went through a two month period of constant suicidal ideation in 2015 and was put on 40mg Viibryd. It saved my life, career, and sanity. I&#039;ve been taking it as prescribed for 1 1/2 years and my depression doesn&#039;t control my life and thoughts anymore. I still get situational depression, but it doesn&#039;t spiral like it always used to. I experienced no side-effects. Highly recommended if you want to try something new."
