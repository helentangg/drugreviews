"I got on citalopram because I had episodes where my heart felt like it was skipping beats and I would check my pulse 24/7 and would only focus on that. I would jump out of the bed in the middle of the night in a panic ready to call 911. It was horrible, I hardly slept. Then I got 20 mg and it was heaven sent. My heart beat was normal. Well now my doctor upped me to 40 mg because I told her I could use a bit more. I have 3 kids. I highly recommend this product."
