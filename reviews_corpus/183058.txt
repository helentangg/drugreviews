"I had classic fibromyalgia symptoms, after researching many things that would fall into this category, and I was at the point where I was about to give up, literally. I had become depressed, after dealing with fibromyalgia for so long, it had broken me. I have a lot of will power, and normally would have laughed at the thought of taking my own life, but after about 2 years of these symptoms, it was winning, and didn&#039;t think I could go on for much longer. So, after trying a couple different medications, I was put on Cymbalta. This medication saved my life. It has reduced my pain levels by at least 2-3 points on a ten point scale, and fixed my mood as well. I cannot say enough about how happy I am with this medication."
