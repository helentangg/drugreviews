"18 years.  I switched to pristiq after paxil and Wellbutrin.  I took a gene sight test that predicted me to have the least amount of side affects with pristiq (which I highly recommend). I had almost no side effects.  After the pristiq started to kick in I felt alright, not too great or severely depressed.  I did feel well enough to go to school (I couldn&#039;t on Paxil).  However after about a month I noticed a shift; I felt a lot better than usual at times and at others I felt depressed.  I also have had racing thoughts and mood swings become more common. I became worried I had bi polar disorder. I told my psychiatrist this and he believed it was coming from pristiq. Coming off has been a hard.  My mind has been in a fog, hot flashes, flu like symptoms"
