"I have switched from Zoloft to Celexa because Zoloft wasn&#039;t working for me like it used to.  I have been on the Celexa for only about a week but I am experiencing stomach pain.  I am irritable, moody, and have even surprised myself with suicidal thoughts which I have never had before.  This medication is so not for me, however, everyone&#039;s experience is different because our bodies are so different."
