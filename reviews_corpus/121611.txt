"I have been taking Effexor for 8 years. Started 100mg raised over the years, now taking 300mg. Anxiety is roof level, Panic attacks are more frequent, literally feel my brain sparking. I&#039;m tearful, short wicked, don&#039;t sleep much, appetite is 50/50. No motivation, I have had the same doctor for 13 years."
