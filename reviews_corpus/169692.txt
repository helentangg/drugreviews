"I first started out at 50mg of Elavil almost 2 years ago.  It was like instant heaven!  I am a horrible insomniac and with Elavil I was getting good quality sleep and woke up feeling rested.  I was also on Lyrica at the time.  For a while both of them together had me feeling a lot better.  Unfortunately I have a very high tolerance to any medicine.  I am now at 150mg Elavil.  I can&#039;t imagine going any higher yet my pain is increasing so I don&#039;t know what will happen when I totally max out at this level.  I no longer take Lyrica as I became tolerant.  Savella seems to help with fibromyalgia fog but it doesn&#039;t touch my pain.  Give it a try. "
