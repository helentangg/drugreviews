"I was 1st prescribed Zoloft, which for me was absolutely perfect until none of my clothes fit about 3 months into it.  I gained 25 lbs and the weight gain brought new depression and anxiety.  I was put on Wellbutrin which was a &quot;nice&quot; drug if your depression isn&#039;t too severe and I lost weight on the it, but it couldn&#039;t hold a candle to my problems.  Then, I tried Pristiq (and I also use Valium and Ambien for any additional anxiety).  It&#039;s a happy medium between the 2 medicines.  You won&#039;t have the side effects of Zoloft (weight gain, loss of sexual interest), but you&#039;ll have a stronger backing against the physical and mental toll of depression and anxiety.  "
