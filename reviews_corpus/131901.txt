"I have been on Effexor XR for over 15 years. I take a daily dosage of 300mg. It has been the most significant thing in my life! I am able to function normally, hold down a sometimes stressful job, be a great parent and most of all be the best me possible. I have a hormonal imbalance which causes my depression and no amount of psychological intervention was ever going to change that. Effexor XR did. Whilst there are side effects, my body has become accustomed to them and believe me they are nothing in comparison to the dreadful depression. I believe that it has saved my life and ensured that the life I lead is a good one. A couple of tablets a day, some minor side effects and I can get on with a wonderful life."
