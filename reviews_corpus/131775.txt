"I use to have panic attacks everyday for three years. I was scared to go to sleep. I&#039;ve tried so many antidepressant and effexor was the only thing that worked with little to no side effects. My Dr. started me on 75mg, then increased it two wks later to 100mg. I&#039;ve been on 100mg for almost a yr and I still haven&#039;t had a panic attack or anxiety."
