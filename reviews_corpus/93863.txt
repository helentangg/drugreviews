"I took this from Feb 2017 until Sept 2017 for my GAD. I alternated between 5mg &amp; 10mg daily.
It worked ok for my anxiety, but just ok.
Sex drive non-existent.
Gained 20 lbs with no other lifestyle changes, so it had to be this medicine.
I stopped with no withdrawal symptoms so that&#039;s good."
