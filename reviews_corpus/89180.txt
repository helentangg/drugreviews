"I had severe anxiety and agoraphobia. Every time I would get in a car I would wonder if I was going to die that day. These symptoms all started when I had children. I started to wonder what would happen to my children if something happened to me. And I thought about how attached they are to me and how it would break their hearts. So I told my doctor about it. She prescribed Celexa. I&#039;ve been on it for about 2 months now and the quality of my life has changed so drastically. I&#039;m not always thinking about dying. I&#039;m able to go out in crowds and not be worried. Yesterday I was dealing with something stressful and I was stressed about it, but I stayed calm and I moved on. It didn&#039;t consume me like stressful events used to do."
