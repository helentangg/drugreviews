"I&#039;ve been taking Zoloft for 6 weeks. I was a mess before, so stressed out, lashing out at my husband and in tears daily. I felt so overwhelmed with life. Once I started taking Zoloft all of that went away. I feel SO much more calm and have not had a breakdown since. Side effects for me: gas, sometimes rapid heart beat, occasional dry mouth and can make waking up very difficult (this happened when I tried to increase my dose, per doctor&#039;s orders). It does give me very vivid dreams, which doesn&#039;t bother me and I&#039;m sleeping like a champ. Sex drive is very sad, but it wasn&#039;t great before with the anxiety. Sometimes a glass of wine (I know, a no-no!) really helps with that! I am really happy with it. No noticeable weight changes."
