"I took this medication for the best part of a year to treat anxiety and stress and to list a few symptoms of my stress; mood swings, irritability, insomnia, Manic etc.. thus it was having an effect on my relationship. Although I thought at first the medication was working, it in fact encouraged more mood related symptoms to occur more frequently. I didn&#039;t realise that it was effecting me the way it was until coming off this medication, which came shortly after a nervous breakdown and the end of a beautiful relationship. Dr&#039;s words were; They are renowned for those symptoms!! which is ironic because that is the very reason I sought help in the first place. I just wish I had fully understood the risks, because now everyday I live with regret."
