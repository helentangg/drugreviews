"I no longer sleep all the time.  I have more energy and less pain.  The overwhelming sadness is gone.  The only weird thing is that I feel like CAN&#039;T cry anymore...even when I want to.  But I will take no crying with the way I feel. I am like a new person.  Went from 30- 60 mg and feel wonderful."
