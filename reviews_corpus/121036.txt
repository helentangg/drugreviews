"I was on estroidot 25 patch for nine years after a complete hysterectomy. Concerned about breast cancer my doctor put me on venlafaxine 37.5 mg to help with hot flashes plus anxiety after my son passed away,  the effect was unbelievable. Minimal hot flashes and my grief and sadness was not nearly as bad as before. It was immediate. I was nauseated for a couple of weeks at first which passed. I also had anxiety for about two weeks which has passed. It has done wonders for me. I suggest that you not give up on it at the beginning because after about a month it really calmed me and helped with both situations that I needed help with. Hope this helps. Did not increase my dose as of yet.... four months."
