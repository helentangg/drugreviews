"Marplan has been very effective on my bipolar depression. I have been on nearly every antidepressent available with limited or short-term success only. I have been taking Marplan for 3 months and have reduced my symptoms from continious to occasional. My side effects were severe hypotension, muscle pain, weight gain and inability to have orgasms. Everything has gone away except for the last two."
