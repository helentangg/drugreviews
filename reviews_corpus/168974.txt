"Both my husband and I are on Viibryd.  We share side effects such as gritting our teeth and having to take the medicine at the same time every day.  If he takes his even just an hour late he feels like he gets an instant high for 1-3 seconds &amp; then its gone.  He has nightmares, where he see&#039;s things &amp; he screams in his dreams but not truly out loud. In the first month we both experienced our limbs jerking as we tried to fall asleep. Now he hears a loud buzzing noise &amp; then a loud bang &amp; he wakes up with his heart racing. As I fall asleep hear a loud bang as if a gun is going off right in my ear and a horrible electric shock to my brain &amp; wake with my heart racing.  We are seriously thinking of titrating off the medicine."
