"I was prescribed this medicine after being hospitalized in a mental facility. I was previously taking Zoloft and Wellbutrin which stopped working for me and the increase in dosage led to increase in depression and anxiety. I have to say Effexor beats any anxiety medicines I have ever taken. This medicine makes me feel normal. The only down side is the side effect your body has if you miss a dosage. I began to feel light headed and very emotional if I miss more that 1 dose."
