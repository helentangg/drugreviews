"I will start by saying that I suffer from major depression. I have tried just about everything in the book and was starting to just about feel like giving up hope (on medications that is!) and was completely exhausted. My doctor just recently, put me on Pristiq and almost immediately I noticed a difference and have had no side effects what so ever. I have been excited about life and happy to get out of bed everyday now. It has been a drastic change and I am so thankful. I&#039;m not sure how this medicine might take to others, but for me it has worked wonders. "
