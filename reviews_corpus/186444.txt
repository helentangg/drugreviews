"Pristiq has given me energy, stopped my crying, and for the first time in my life I can say out loud that I don&#039;t hate myself. Although I am extremely sensitive to medications and usually suffer all the worst side effects, I have had no negative effects from this medication other than gaining about 5 pounds over a two month period."
