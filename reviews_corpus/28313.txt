"Out of nowhere, due to what they think is genetics, I got hit with depression, anxiety, and a form of OCD in my early twenties. The Lexapro was a life saver. Although, I still have negative thoughts on a daily basis, I&#039;m able to cope, and I&#039;m not miserable like I was. However, there is one common downside to this medicine that has left me terribly upset and frustrated. I&#039;ve been on Lexapro for a year and a half now and have put on about 20 lbs. I work out almost every day and eat right for the most part. I have not shed a pound. I&#039;ve never been this big before and to me, I feel as though Lexapro isn&#039;t worth it anymore. I&#039;m weening off of it with my doctor&#039;s help, and am going to try and cope with my issues with different methods."
