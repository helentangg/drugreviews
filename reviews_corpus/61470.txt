"Hi. Have read quite a few reviews here and pleased with the great advice &amp; positive feedback on Citalopram. But I wanted to document my own experience on 20mg. I&#039;m only on day 4. I&#039;ve had quite a few side-effects but reading here I&#039;m reassured that&#039;s normal. I noticed side-effects within about 4hrs of taking first tablet: Constant: brain fog, tinnitus ; Occasional: headache, nausea, sweating and shooting anxiety ; Rarely: brain-zaps, minor twitching of muscles. Generally anxiety is slightly up. If I hadn&#039;t read other people&#039;s experiences of staying with this drug for a few weeks I may have gone back to the GP and asked for a different AD as the side-effects took me by surprise.  I just hope these will subside and I get some +ve benefits."
