"I had Terrible obsessive thoughts and anxiety for years which started when I was 20 after I had my daughter my nan died and it became so crippling I was in able to cope and although I&#039;m against medication  I know my daughter came first And she needs a happy mummy. I went on them 10mg at first but as it made me feel worse I was literally a wreak so doctor started me at 5mg and built me up to 20mg over 6 weeks and as it makes u feel worse before better he gave me some diazapam just to take the edge of while I was getting used to it within 6 weeks I started to feel better I came of the diazapam and stayed on 20mg for 4 years now I felt awesome I was a new woman happy strong and my career flew off.
