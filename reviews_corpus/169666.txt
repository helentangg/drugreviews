"I had been tested for everything to try and find the cause of constant bladder infections, or so I thought. It wasn&#039;t till I saw a urologist that I found the answer to my problem. I never had Bladder infections, but chronic cystitis, found after some very intrusive camera shots of my bladder. She first tried stretching my bladder to see if this helped. It didn&#039;t. She then suggested Endep, not for depression but it had been used for cystitis and burning mouth, which I also suffer from. It has helped my burning bladder problem 100% as long as I don&#039;t forget to take my tablets. If I forget just one, I have the pain back for about two weeks before I get back on track.
My burning mouth is also about 60% better but not gone. &quot;Side effects weight gain&quot;."
