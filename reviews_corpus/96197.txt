"I&#039;ve been on Zoloft for 2 months now. At first it was really weird like I was unable to conjure up any thoughts at all, but it was a nice little vacation from myself. I also had diarrhea and insomnia. The diarrhea wasn&#039;t too bad and the insomnia let me stay up by myself and watch stand up comedy and not think about anything else. I kind of liked it, but it went away. The antidepressants definitely kicked in at 4 weeks, the world became bright and shiny. I&#039;ve cried one time since I started taking it and that was my sons first day of kindergarten, and I had been crying almost every single day before. I love Zoloft, it gave my life back."
