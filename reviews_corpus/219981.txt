"Been suffering from severe right eye &amp; top of the head pains, which normally develop into excruciating migraines and last for hours so I&#039;m forced to take Migraleve which helps sometimes and go to bed with lights off and just rest. My doc prescribed me Amitriptyline and I took it 5 times in a month so far. I get a few side effects (insomnia, depression) and can only take them a few hours before bed as they still affect me the day after (sleepiness, tiredness, inability to focus). It does work almost immediately, and the effect last for a week even, which is great. I feel very relaxed but I noticed that I started feeling without reason rather depressed, to the point that one day I actually felt a bit suicidal so I stopped taking them for a week"
