"Doctor Prescribed this to me after I was diagnosed with IBS. It seemed to work, but I didn&#039;t believe I was getting full effect. The doctor said at my young age of 17 (I&#039;m now 18 since August 2017) I should not take as high as a dosage as some people but my pain I had told them I needed more so I moved from 10mg to 20mg. I often get very thirsty as a side affect and I&#039;m almost always constipated. I&#039;m actually typing this up as I&#039;m in the bathroom right now, constipated. I don&#039;t believe I should be taking other medicines like laxatives or probiotics just to make up for this medicine that should be helping me."
