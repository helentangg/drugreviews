"I am now 60. Ive been trying to find the right medication for decades. I&#039;ve been on many different ones.  In 2009, I agreed to another- Zoloft. Took 50 mg/day for a month to six weeks- went back to the psych doc despondent. He raised the dose to 200mg, the limit for safety. Within one week, I started to feel &quot;normal&quot;, a condition I don&#039;t remember having for many decades. I&#039;ve been on this medication since 2010 at the same dose, 200mg/ day. It has made all the difference in my happiness, productivity, confidence, being able to work, cope effectively with life&#039;s inevitable disappointments and have only one sad regret. How I wish this medication was available in 1970&#039;s to 1980&#039;s when I so desperately needed it."
