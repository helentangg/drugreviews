"My son is almost a month old and after I had him I thought I was losing my mind and couldn&#039;t stop crying. It was horrible. I was put on the medication and I&#039;ve been doing 100% better, the only side effect I&#039;ve experienced is the drowsiness... but its worth it. Now that my emotions are stable and I&#039;m not snapping on my 5 year old anymore or crying uncontrollably."
