"I started taking Zoloft in October of 2003 for depression and attention deficit disorder. I have had no complaints. This is a wonderful medicine for me. I have found that the brand name works better on me than the generic brand. I know they aren&#039;t supposed to be different but they are. On the generic I have suicidal thoughts which I didn&#039;t have before I started on the medicine. On the brand name, I don&#039;t have this issues and feel so much better. I like myself and other people like me better too."
