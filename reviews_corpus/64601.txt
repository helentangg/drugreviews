"Yo so I was prescribed Zoloft for Depression, Adult Major Depressive Disorder, and PTSD. It has only been a couple months so maybe I&#039;m not one to judge yet. I guess I feel okay. Like I feel less extremely depressed, I&#039;m still a sad girl tho, and honestly I feel like I could stop and feel pretty much the same. Although withdrawals are a bitch. There have been weekends where I have left my pills somewhere or not gotten a re-up from my doc and believe me my boyfriend, friends, and fam can all tell something is up when i&#039;m not on my meds. I&#039;m just quicker to react to shit and not really okay and feel kinda insane. I&#039;m getting off Zoloft now. I wouldn&#039;t say it was bad I just need more help. I didn&#039;t feel motivated to do anything ever. soo... :/ yah"
