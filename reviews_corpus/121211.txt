"Effexor is amazing. I have PTSD and cyclothemia.  I went through therapy and then added this years later.  I am stronger, enjoy life and I actually have a better sex life cuz I&#039;m in a better mood and can feel emotionally what I need to. 

For the women out there: I tried to push past the numbness and I can now can achieve full multiple orgasms. There&#039;s away if you are determined enough. 

Best of luck to everyone trying hard to maintain a peaceful life full of hope and self love."
