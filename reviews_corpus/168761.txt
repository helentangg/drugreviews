"Vibbryd is a saint and a devil. I have been on it for almost two years. It saved me as I was going of the deep end and I could no longer contain my anger and every day little things would set me off. The side effects when first going on were AWFUL. The demonic dreams were the worst but this all happened when I jumped from 20 mg to 40 mg. I solved this by taking 30mg for a while then going to 40 mg. No more rage. I take everything in stride. My mind is clear and I function perfectly. Now for the devil. You have to take this around the same time everyday. If I forget I always know. I start to itch and get a headache. The nightmares if forgotten are terrible. Its as if they are real.  Just remember to take every day!  Preferably in the morning"
