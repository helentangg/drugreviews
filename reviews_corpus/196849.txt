"A GYN prescribed Brisdelle - it&#039;s a low-dose Paxil (7.5 mg) for hot flashes. 
This Doctor stated that unlike other SSRI&#039;s, I would NOT have complications or side effects going on/off them - in the case of running out of supply. This was NOT my experience. After 3-4 days of stopping, I noted an odd sensation connected to my eyes. I told my opthamologist about a &quot;swishing&quot; sound I heard with any movement of my eyes. I finally found others reporting this all over the internet. This also happened in a previous year with Sertraline (Zoloft) - this &#039;after quitting&#039; side effect lasted a very long time - maybe a year or more!  
THE DUMBEST, MOST WASTEFUL PACKAGING ON THE PLANET. WHY NOT SIMPLY MAKE 7.5 PAXIL IN A SIMPLE BOTTLE?  Pink? Come on!"
