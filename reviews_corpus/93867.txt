"I&#039;ve been on Trintellix for 7 weeks along with Buspirone for Anxiety, which is my biggest problem. About 1 month in on Trintellix I got hives and itchy skin too.  Wasn&#039;t sure what that was about.  The hives seem to be going away slowly, not all gone yet but the itchy skin remains.  It&#039;s manageable, just annoying.  Not really sure this medication is helping me.  Right now just trying to get/keep the anxiety under control."
