"I have severe depression and am Bi-polar. I have been on almost every drug out there. Doctor put me on Viibryd and have been taking it for about 3 weeks and it has worked great for me. I was having suicidal thoughts every day for nearly a year. Now that I am on Viibryd they have gone away. It&#039;s a great relief! The diarrhea and insomnia are minor side effects and cost are minor compared to the benefits. All I can say is it works great for me."
