"I had for at least 11 years suffered from anxiety disorder for years. Worrying, palpitations, shortness of breath, basically all the popular anxiety symptoms. I am on Lexapro because it does work. Side effects like lower sex drive, difficulty reaching orgasm, insomnia all go away. I find myself fearless, my life is active, no more &quot;what if&#039;s&quot; and no anxiety attacks. It&#039;s a miracle pill. BUT, I was 135 pounds, skinny. I&#039;m 5&#039;5 I had an amazing metabolism my body was rock solid. After 3 years of Lexapro I am now 165 pounds.  I have to try work out and eat healthy I know. 
Please don&#039;t wait as long as I did to change your life and get back to your wonderfully made self!"
