"I have been battling severe depression for most of my life, and at 30 years old I finally decided to seek help. I was prescribed 10 mg at first and it has been gradually increased at different increments over the last year and a half. I am currently taking 60 mg Prozac daily. Taking Prozac has definitely helped my moods, but no pill is a fix-all.  I recommend counseling also. I have had some issues with weight gain and loss of libido. I&#039;ve noticed that once I have been on a stable dosage for a while, the libido does come back."
