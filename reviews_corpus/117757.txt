"I was in a bad car accident over a year ago, and had and STILL have terrible migraines after suffering a concussion. I will tell you now that out of all the steroid injections (16 in my neck, and base of my skull), physical therapy, different pain medications, nortriptyline has helped me the most. I still have headaches here and there, but it&#039;s not every day and I&#039;m not calling out of work every other week. Since I have been on it, I haven&#039;t called out of work. I have about 2-3 headaches a week, but instead of rating the pain a 8,9,or 10 I&#039;m now in a pain range of 3 or 4, sometimes 5. I may be taking this drug for the rest of my life, but it beats waking up in pain everyday."
