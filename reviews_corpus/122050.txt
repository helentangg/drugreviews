"I discovered this site today while looking for other answers to the generic versions of Effexor XR.  I was on Prozac for about 4 years due to my MS and caring for and losing both my husband and mother to Cancer in a 18 month time frame.  I asked to switch to something else as Prozac didn&#039;t really help. It took a bit to wean me and put me on a low dose of Effexor ER 75mg a day and I eventually got bumped to 150mg a day of Effexor XR.  It&#039;s been a real life saver for me, I feel normal and do not have days of tears for no reason. "
