"I have been on this medication for about 6 months now. Overall I feel good. The first month was awful. I was so sick to my stomach I could hardly function but I stuck with it after all the past medications that failed. After a month I felt great no anxiety/depression. After a few months things started to level out. At times I still feel depressed or have panic attacks but it is much much better than before. This medication gave me my life back. I take this medication at night. If I miss a dose I get very sick and cannot even get out of bed until I take it which is a huge downfall. Also I absolutely cannot drink any bit of alcohol while on this medication or else I feel very I&#039;ll."
