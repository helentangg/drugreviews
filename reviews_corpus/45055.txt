"Hi .. First of  all I am a woman who didn&#039;t believe in any antidepressants ever! Then came the dreaded monster I call menopause (well for me it was tough) not all woman have it so BAD. Anyways I met with my Dr. and told her everything that  I felt and she prescribe 20 of prozac. I came home saying to myself  gee I cant take this - I heard so much negative things back in the 80&#039;s in high school ..? Then I said well its either giving it a try and hope for the best, or lose my Husband of 20 yrs and cry more.. So I took a pill that same afternoon and wow I can say it took about 3 weeks before major  difference butI am thankful everyday and night  as I am so much happier."
