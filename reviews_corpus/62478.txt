"I was on citalopram 40 mg for 3 months. It was great, made me love myself (which I had never done in the past). Only problem I had was, I was always tired and I had no sex drive whatsoever and it was impossible to get an orgasm. Today will be my 5th day off of the medication because it is causing problems in my relationship and I feel terrible withdrawals from this medication. It is like death warming over, very dizzy, vomiting, diarrhea, can&#039;t sleep major mood swings, unexplained crying. I feel like I&#039;m a zombie. I can&#039;t think, can barely walk, body aches. I&#039;ve been out of work for 2 days now and tomorrow will make day 3. According to the doctor there is nothing to make this any better but start the medicine back and slowly come off of it. Hope this helps."
