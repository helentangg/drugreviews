"I have been on Pristiq for about 3 weeks. I have had major depression for about 20 years. Have been on everything on the market. I also take Ativan for anxiety. I am 52 years old and have not had a period for almost 2 years. That has changed. I am going to my doctor to see if this is normal. Otherwise I feel great. I have been on Paxil for almost 5 years (60mg dose). I now take 50mgs of Pristiq. It was very hard transitioning from Paxil to Pristiq. The withdrawals were bad."
