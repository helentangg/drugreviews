"I&#039;d struggled with bulimia and depression  for many years, I was prescribed Prozac to mainly treat my depression, and partly the eating disorder. 

With my personal experience with bulimia I never had the urges to binge eat, just to make myself vomit after eating proper sized portions of food. I had found that the Prozac had helped stopped the urges to throw up after eating quite effectively. The only side effect being that once I had stopped taking it the urges returned immediately. 

Currently and trying to battle those thoughts without being prescribed medication, but may go back onto it if I&#039;m unsuccessful after a year, or so."
