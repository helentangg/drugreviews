"I have been taking Zoloft for a few months now. I started taking it for anxiety. I was having panic attacks while driving. It is a lot better now that I am on Zoloft. I no longer get panic attacks while driving. I&#039;m glad I started taking it. I even pass up the big trucks which is something I would not do before I was on Zoloft. I&#039;m definitely happy with the medication."
