"I was a depressed with extreme generalized anxiety disorder. I was a total mess to the point I couldn&#039;t function properly on my daily life. I was put on valium (Diazepam) but it&#039;s a very temporary fix, plus it&#039;s extremely addictive. So my doctor change my medication and put me on 20 ml  of Citalopram (celexa) a day. What a life saver it has been. Depression has disappeared 100% and my anxiety is gone 80%. Only side effects I&#039;m noticing is my sex drive, it&#039;s almost gone. Also I feel slightly tired sometimes. But it&#039;s totally worth it. I guess you can&#039;t have your cake and eat it too."
