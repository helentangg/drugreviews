"I&#039;ve been dealing with panic disorder/anxiety since I was 11-12 years old and have basically tried everything out there. While I was medication free for almost two years, I recently started having severe panic attacks again and subsequently was suffering from agoraphobia. My doctor put me on Klonopin (which I had used successfully in the past) but a friend with similar issues recommended Pristiq. I am currently taking 1mg of Klonopin 4 times a day (max dose for panic disorders), 10mg of Ambien at night to sleep and recently increased the Pristiq to 100mg.

While I still have a way to go, I feel worlds better and certainly much better than on any other medication that I have ever taken."
