"I have taken this medication before and ran out because I don&#039;t have insurance and had to go through one of the drug help agencies to get back on it.  I started back on the medicine (30mg capsules) and have had severe eye problems, on the edge of my seat, tremors, OCD issues such as twisting my hair, constantly walking the floor. I can&#039;t sleep when I take this medication and the night sweats and low grade fever is miserable. I have also had a constant headache while taking this medication along with a low grade fever. I have no sex drive at all and I am in school and my mind goes blank. I feel like my head is sometimes floating above my body. "
