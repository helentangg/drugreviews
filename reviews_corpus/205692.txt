"Took Lexapro for 5 years, gained 30 lbs (am very active), fell asleep at stop signs, very lethargic. Finally spoke with people who had had same effects, weaned off.  Terrible crash, lost 15 lbs.  Started Wellbutirn, had energy, which was wonderful, rages were awful.  I have started Pristiq with Wellbutrin wean; Pristiq 1 day, Wellbutrin the next for a week, then 2:1, 3:1, etc.  I am optimistic.  I feel better just addressing the problem and relieved to find some help.  Am raising 3 children and want better for them.  Worth mentioning, abrupt change of any medicines can cause withdrawal symptoms.  Beware and make sure that you read the signs.  Headache, nausea, mood swings, sweats, appetite loss etc. "
