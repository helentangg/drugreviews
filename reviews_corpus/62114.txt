"I have been on Citalopram for about four months now. I started at 10 mg and now I am on 20 mg a day. My personal experience has been great. I felt better within days not completely but the edge had been taken away which with the way I felt was a huge relief. I have been lucky to have had no side effects other that a slight decrease in sexual tension which I am good with.  Though recently I missed three days because I didn&#039;t get my refill and I was knocked off balance a bit, don&#039;t miss your refills. I am grateful for this medicine, I was such an emotional mess before it."
