"Taking Citalopram for almost 3 years now, starting at 10mg and now 30mg dosage. I know the drug is different for everyone, but it&#039;s really helped me. I still suffer very bad anxiety, but depressive periods and mood swings seem to be under control. It&#039;s really important not to rely just on medication though, it&#039;s definitely only worked together with therapist/changing a few things (way I communicate etc). 

A huge downside to begin with was how tired I was, I would take the meds at night and then not be able to wake up properly, would easily fall back asleep until lunchtime. I now take them around 2pm. I experimented a lot with the timings! This seems best for me as I&#039;m usually out/busy in the afternoons so don&#039;t get caught tired."
