"I was put on Lexapro a few years ago when we lost our son. It made things bearable. I am so happy for medical science. I went off it for about a year and had another tragedy happen to me. I have been back on 10mg for a few weeks now and love it. I notice I have to control myself when I take 10mg but when I take 20mg nothing can upset me. It&#039;s great. It also only took a few days for me to start feeling better. Thanks Lexapro I can finally work on my issues."
