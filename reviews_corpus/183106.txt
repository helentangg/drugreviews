"Cymbalta was a miracle for me. I was paralyzed by anxiety and couldn&#039;t function in daily life and it made me feel better than I&#039;ve ever felt in my life. I&#039;ve tried tons of anxiety/depression meds; Xanax, Klonopin, Buspar, Ativan, Zoloft, Celexa, etc. and they all barely worked, just made me catatonic, or had really serious side effects (listlessness, decreased libido, etc.). Cymbalta made me feel like my true self minus anxiety, rather than a dulled version of myself. It actually increased my libido because I wasn&#039;t too depressed to have sex for the first time. I also lost weight while taking it, which wasn&#039;t desirable for me, but I know it is for some people. The only negatives I experienced were nausea and decreased appetite at first."
