"I have been off and on this for over ten years. I will go years taking it  and then go through the long weaning off period go about six months symptom free, then it starts all over after doing this 3 times I have resolved myself to my doctors advice to stay on it till I am done with menopause. No complaints though it has been a great keeps me at my normal self I just hate taking any Medication.So don&#039;t suffer really it is not something you can control.It is a true chemical imbalance and Paxil rebalances you. it does take a few weeks when you begin. I did have terrible dry mouth and zero appetite for a month but then everything adjusted and it has been a blessing. You are never alone reach out get help and GOD bless  &lt;3"
