"My Dr. put me on 25mg to help me sleep and stop unwanted thoughts as a result of marital stress. I was experiencing a knot in my stomach and episodes of weeping.  Since starting this medication, I feel so much happier, rested, relaxed.
I had diarrhea for the first 2 days, but it was mild. I am not feeling out of control anymore.
I think when my marriage issues are over, I will stop taking it.  This medicine has really come through!"
