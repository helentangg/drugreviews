"This medication did a generally good job of changing my depression from excruciating sadness to mindless zombie. I was tired all the time and had extreme brain fog, (couldn&#039;t think straight... or at all). I felt kind of good, but I couldn&#039;t actually feel pleasure from anything or focus. I was like a cat and just sort of lay around in a state of contented dissociation. Was on and off it a few times for up to several months. Found the majority of it&#039;s effects subsided after a few months and I was back to feeling empty and sad all the time. Good medication for having a break from misery, but wasn&#039;t very useful for actually recovering from my depression or getting my life back."
