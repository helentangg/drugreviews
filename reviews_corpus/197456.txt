"I tried Zoloft for depression and it made me hyper.  Paxil works.  I have used it two times during my life when I was depressed and self-help was not working.  It worked great for depression and I didn&#039;t have many side effects EXCEPT that I cannot achieve orgasm while taking this medication.  Nada.  I have a wonderful husband and I am used to a good sex life.  Paxil kills it.  As soon as I&#039;m off the drug for a week, everything comes back.  I hate losing sex but I hate being depressed more.  In the end, that is the choice for me."
