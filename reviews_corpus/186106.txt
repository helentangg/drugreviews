"Was put on pristiq around 8 months ago for severe anxiety/panic attacks. I couldn&#039;t even drop my kids at school without a panic attack and we live a minute from the school, I didn&#039;t wanna do anything go anywhere it was affecting my kids, my marriage, everything. Now I have my life back I put off going to the doc for a year, I wish I hadn&#039;t. I can function again. I did have to up my dose after about a month to 100mg and I still have a day here or there that I can feel my anxiety bubbling under the surface but it&#039;s nothing like it was it&#039;s manageable."
