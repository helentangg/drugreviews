"I have always had EXTREME anxiety, ever since I started puberty basically. Social situations intensified it, but I always had it. It was something I could never shut off, I always was very tense especially in the neck and back region. I couldn&#039;t even feel comfortable walking around in my own house it was so severe. Once I finally came to my doctor with this I was prescribed citalopram. I noticed the effect of the medication within about a day. It was amazing. Every time I felt anxiety coming on it was blocked. I still feel anxiety when it&#039;s appropriate, like meeting a guy, or trying something new; the normal things that you get anxious or nervous about. But I can finally relax and think straight all the time now and I&#039;ve never felt so good."
