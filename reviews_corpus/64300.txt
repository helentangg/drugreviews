"I started this antidepressant today I was on it before and couldnt tell a difference in anything now I feel numbed and negative thoughts that keep returning thoughts of giving up and isolation and failure  and anger rage paranoia are stronger than ever before I was told it takes two to six weeks to feel full affect I will stop this medication I feel 10x worse thanks but no thanks"
