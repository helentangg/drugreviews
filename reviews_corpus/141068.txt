"I didn&#039;t think it loxalate could help me, I thought my bad life choices and my past and future was just something I had to live with. I didn&#039;t see myself as depressed, I just thought I had stuffed up my life.
I thought when I told my Dr that I was feely down he would question me intensively.
Not so !  He just handed me a small questionnaire with about 10 questions on how I was feeling ,,,, multi choice answers numbered 1 to 5 
My score result suggested I was depressed and he prescribed me 10mg loxa late tablets.   I felt relieved for the first few days, but then it took more than 2 weeks for the tablets to start. Now after 5 weeks I&#039;ve gone from feeling 3 out of 10  to 6/10.  I never miss a tablet and I stopped my occasional alcohol drink"
