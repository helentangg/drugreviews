"I have been in sertraline for 4 months now as I suffer from anxiety and stress. Here is my experience.

As an 18 year old teenager I suffer from anxiety due to family issues. I went to the doctors and they prescribed me with these tablets and counselling. I took my tablets and attended counselling. The first few weeks of taking my tablets I felt awful , shaking, dizzy, being sick, heart was racing like mad and I felt just unwell. When a month went past I felt a lot calmer and a lot more controlled. 4 months later at this moment in time I am having a bit of anxiety due to more stress. Still on the tablets but hopefully it should calm down soon. I am very aware of anyone who suffers from anxiety how hard it is. :)"
