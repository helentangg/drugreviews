"This has helped me feel like me again and I wouldn&#039;t normally write on these forums. I have had increasingly bad pmt through 30&#039;s and my 40&#039;s and this is the only thing that helps. Calmer...happier more energy..more resilience. Less irritation with loved ones but also more assertive when I need to be. Only slight side effect wad morning sweats which have worn off now. I don&#039;t ever want this to stop."
