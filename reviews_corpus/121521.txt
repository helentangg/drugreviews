"I first took celexa but due to  bad hot flashes due to hormonal therapy for cancer, Celexa didn&#039;t really work for hot flashes but it did for anxiety it. With Venlafaxine there was no side effects I felt good from the day one, then upped the dosage to 150mg. Hot flashes are better, panicky feeling is there but it keeps it controlled. It&#039;s my 3rd week so I hope to get better as time goes by. I am 35"
