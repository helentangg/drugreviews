"I was diagnosed with depression and generalized anxiety disorder after having panic attacks brought on by projects at work.  It was horrible...feelings of dread, pounding heart, I couldn&#039;t sleep, I couldn&#039;t eat, the non-stop stress hormones made my veins feel like they were full of broken glass...ugh!  I was started on Ratio-Venlafaxine at 37.5 mg (one capsule) per day for the first week and then 75 mg (two capsules) thereafter.  When I started, I had unusually sweaty palms and feet, but that has disappeared.  On one capsule per day I felt way better.  The medication lifted my mood and allowed me to sleep.  Now that I have been on two capsule per day, I find that I get hot flashes through my torso, nausea, and at night I seem to twitch."
