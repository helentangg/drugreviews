"I have been on Zoloft for the past 12 years, and it truly gave me my life back.  It was a God send.  I am still taking 150mg per day, but have noticed more anxiety and depression lately.  I question whether it is working anymore. My doctor wants to wean me off Zoloft and put me on Lexapro.  I am torn over what to do. I don&#039;t want to be like I was before I started taking Zoloft, and I am so afraid to go off it."
