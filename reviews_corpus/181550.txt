"I&#039;ve been on a 10mg dose for 2 years and it has helped substantially. I had very bad anxiety (PTSD) and couldn&#039;t drive, and basically stopped eating. My heart would race and I just could not deal with the anxiety anymore. Taking this dose and having regular therapy has allowed me to get back to myself. I didn&#039;t have any side effects and I&#039;ve never had to increase the dose. It is a really great medication."
