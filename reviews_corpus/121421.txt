"I was on this medication for 12 years and was sick from it for 12 years. I was on it for debilitating anxiety.  It gave my a disorder called Postural Ortho Tacychardia. I had to see a Cardiologist. I always felt sick and no one doctor could help me or give me any answers. My feelings were also numbed. I turned into a zombie and just slept for 3 or 4 days at a time. I went to a new doctor and started to titrate off of this medication. It took me 8 months to titrate off of this. Titrating off of this is hell ( but you can get off of it ) when the medication was completely out of my system. Because I was numb for so long. The panic came back in one big wave. I ended up in the psychiatric part of the hospital. Be careful with Effexor Xr"
