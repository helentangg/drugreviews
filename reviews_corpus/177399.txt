"I had severe depression &amp; suicidal thoughts due to chronic pain, stiffness, eye health problems &amp; hair loss (symptoms of an arthritic condition I have). Had tried Lexapro &amp; that didn&#039;t work out well for me personally. I have been on duloxetine for about 10 weeks now &amp; it is brilliant (took a month to work). I am back to feeling myself again. I&#039;m looking forward to things, planning activities &amp; meet-ups with friends &amp; family I haven&#039;t seen in ages. Got my appetite back &amp; am sleeping so much better now. I&#039;ve even started planting my own flower garden :-) I can&#039;t believe I waited so long to get help. My advise is don&#039;t get discouraged - there is medicine out there that will work for you!"
