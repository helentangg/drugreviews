"On day 1 of this Cymbalta and it&#039;s awful.  I didn&#039;t sleep last night, have felt tired all day, and struggled to &quot;zone&quot; into conversations or my own thoughts.  I&#039;ve felt worried all day and have had tremors, a sick tummy, a dry mouth and no sex drive.  My doctor prescribed me this so I could deal with stress at work and help reduce my blood pressure.  I don&#039;t think it&#039;s worth the side effects and I won&#039;t be taking anymore.  I will look for other options."
