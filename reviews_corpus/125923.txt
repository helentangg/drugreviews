"I tried viibryd after being on citalopram for a year and a half to see if it would be better. I had no problems transitioning BUT I gained about 10 pounds in the first weeks I was on it full dosage. I NEVER fluctuate more than 1-2 lbs - have weighed the same for 10 years -- and despite eating less &amp; exercising twice as much I couldn&#039;t lose the weight. After ~2 months I switched back to citalopram &amp; lost all the weight in about 2 weeks. Without going to the gym."
