"Miracle drug for sure! I&#039;ve been taking the 50mg dose for about 2 months now. Nothing has ever worked like this (besides Effexor XR, but that made me much more manic) for treating my depression/anxiety. It&#039;s even helped my eating disorder. I hope it continues to be this wonderful, and I won&#039;t have to keep upping my dose to get the same effects. My only side effect so far has been a mild daily headache and crazy night sweats. But I&#039;ll take those any day over crying and screaming on the kitchen floor daily."
