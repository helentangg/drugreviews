"During my 30&#039;s and 40&#039;s I had frequent migraine&#039;s, then from my 50&#039;s on migraine free, but now in my 60&#039;s they came back with a vengeance. So bad, Doctor sent me to Neurologist, then CT scan, scan normal, so put me on indomethacin which didn&#039;t work for me. Seemed to make the migraines worse, thus back to Neurologist, MRI scan, normal, one of the drugs suggested Amitriptyline, 10mg at night. In my third week now, very sleepy first week and thirsty, but not so bad now, but wonderful no migraines whatsoever.  Yippee"
