"Great medicine for anxiety if you are patient and go slowly in titration. It can &quot;activate&quot; your anxiety at first and with dose increases but you need to stick through it. A when required benzodiazepine helps a lot at first. I&#039;d start at 12.5 or 25 and slowly titrate every two weeks, that mitigates the side effects. I think anything between 50 to 100mg is perfect. Fast metabolizers may need more."
