"I was given this originally for fibromyalgia.  It worked well for the pain, however it took a higher dosage to keep th pain away.  The side effects became a problem, spacey, and fuzzy all day.  I tried to stop taking it, yet the Doctor did not want me to stop.  I stopped on my own cold turkey.  Wow, 6 weeks to get it out of my system!  Went to the hospital with withdraw symptoms bad.  "
