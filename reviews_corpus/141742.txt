"I am a 35 yr old female living with depression since 1989, taking medicines off and on since 1995- faithfully since 2007. Lexapro has given me my life back. I am pursuing my personal interests again and have a better attention span. I am easier to deal with although I still have occasional outbursts of anger. I can leave the house, enjoy my family and friends 99.99% of the rest of the time. The breaking in period was difficult - I had diarrhea at 10 mg and when they upped my dose to 20mg I had vomiting too (so I took 10mg one day and 20mg the next for a week). No biggie-  side effects are temporary and the price of admission to my improved life."
