"I have been on Pristiq for 3 months now. I am a 23 year old male who suffers from depression. It is only the second drug I have tried after Cipramil (Which did nothing for me). I started on 50mg, and at first felt great (minus minor nausea, headaches and bad insomnia). However, in comparison to the depression, the side effects were well worth it, and my Doctor said they would go away. The sides only lasted a week and I felt pretty good. A few weeks later however, I was feeling really bad again, so my Doctor upped me to 100mg. This did the same thing as when I first started the medicine, gave me small side effects, but made me feel ALOT better in general. Sure enough the side effects were gone after a few days, but now the 100mg dose isn&#039;t doing much."
