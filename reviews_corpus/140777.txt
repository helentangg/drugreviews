"This pill cleared up so many of my mental and physical symptoms that it&#039;s difficult to list them all. Gone are the black-and-white thinking, the ceaseless pain of existing, the social anxiety, irrational and confused thoughts, inability to truly engage with the world, hopelessness, blank future, exhaustion no matter how much I sleep, procrastination, and psychic agony that only self-harm could alleviate. Not only can I hold an extended conversation with someone, I&#039;m also able to appreciate this improvement in my life instead of feeling like it doesn&#039;t matter.
