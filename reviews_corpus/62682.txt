"I started on 10mg 4 days ago after a long love affair with cannabis brought on depression.I had my doubts about taking anti-depressants but these have been life saving!I have mild bowel problems in the morning and a bit of a headache a couple of hours after dose, also jaw clenching and dry mouth, but its worth it. It more or less started working immediately and I can socialize again. My boyfriend gave me the push I needed and we can now look forward to a bright and happy future together. I owe him and citalopram. I couldn&#039;t be happier, just worried after reading some of the feedback that once I stop the treatment I will regress, fingers crossed it doesn&#039;t happen to me!"
