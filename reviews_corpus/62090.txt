"I have taken 4 doses of Celexa thus far.  I noticed changes about 24 hours in.  Prior to starting I was very out of it, sad, withdrawn, had urges to hurt myself, no appetite, nausea/vomiting, anxiety, etc.  I saw my doctor for my worsening depression and she added Celexa to my other meds (Wellbutrin, Lamictal, Geodon).  I had been on that combination and the same dosages since May 2014.  My boss noticed major negative changes since May.  Today I am a little dizzy and nauseous, but otherwise, feeling much better, which is weird.  I am not used to this feeling.  I was worried this was too drastic of a change because it had been only 24 hours, but after reading other reviews, I am optimistic."
