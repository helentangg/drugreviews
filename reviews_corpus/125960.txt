"I&#039;m a 36 year old male. I&#039;ve been dealing with major anxiety and panic attacks for about 6 years. Been on benzos for as long as I can remember. 
I do tend to drink a couple of times a week and while taking benzodiazepines I would black out all the time. It almost ruined my life. Until one day about 4 months ago my doctor introduced me to Viibryd. It has changed my life. 
I&#039;ve tried it all, Lexapro, Zoloft, Prozac, Wellbutrin, Zyprexa, and many others. Had many sexual side effects among others.
The first week with Viibryd I had nausea. It&#039;s a good idea to eat before taking Viibryd. I now have very little if any panic attacks. They are easy to deal with and control now. I even drink on Viibryd. Though I&#039;m sure it&#039;s not recommended."
