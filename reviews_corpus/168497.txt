"My experience of tranylcypromine [Parnate] was very positive from the beginning. The first time I was administered 20mg I felt suddenly much better than I had for weeks. I wanted to go outside and &#039;see the world&#039;. So far so good.  Now comes the Kick In The Head.  In the UK  30mg is the highest that they can prescribe. However I tried up to 60mg and it has been beneficial and I have come across blogs and psychiatric accounts on the web that suggest that this dose is ok in the USA That would never happen here in the UK. The guidelines stop at 30mg per day which is unacceptable in the UK especially since the price was increased to &pound;25.00 per 28 tablets.  I have had pressure applied from my GP to stop using this drug."
