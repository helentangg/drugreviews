"So after some horrendous blows from life (car accident where my hubs was driving, me in passenger seat, mom behind me...T-Boned and she was killed instantly, I had months of physical therapy, miscarriages, Dad had a massive stroke....just bad thing upon bad thing) I realized that these outside circumstances where absolutely stealing my life away. Now, even previous to these trials and tribulations, I&#039;ve always been a fairly anxious person. I learned to cope with my &quot;issues&quot; through prayer, yoga, books....things of that nature but this last blow of the accident sent some place else. I finally realized I needed help. I&#039;m only on day 2. I feel better but drowsy. I&#039;m hoping this will at least stabilize me once again. (fingers crossed)"
