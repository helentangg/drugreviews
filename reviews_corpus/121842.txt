"I had tried a number of different prescription meds before Effexor, none of which seemed to help.  I can honestly say this worked the best, and with it I was able to get out of bed and begin to function again.  It really was one of those medications that did exactly what it was supposed to. I continued to take Effexor for three years, after which time I wanted to stop taking it and begin to manage my life without medicines.  This is when the problems began.  I can honestly say that it took me almost nine months to wean myself off Effexor.  I no longer have to take medication but would warn anyone being prescribed this that it is not an easy medicine to stop taking."
