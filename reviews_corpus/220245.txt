"I was originally prescribed Amitriptyline for pain prevention.  I found Amitriptyline to be sedative even on very low doses (5mg). I adjusted to each increase in dose, however I had to stop at 15mg per day as it was too sedative and causing me to be  light sleeper.  I went back down to 5mg a day for a couple of months.  However the medicine wasn&#039;t helping much with the pain.  I&#039;ve since been prescribed Nortriptyline."
