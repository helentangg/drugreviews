"Started on 10mg. It helped my anxiety a lot, but I would HAVE to take naps during the day or I couldn&#039;t function. That improved after several months. I upped the dose to 20mg. I forgot what it was like to have social anxiety. It was wonderful.

The downside to this is that I gained 45 pounds in those 11 months. I&#039;m 5&#039;5. I went from 115 to 160. I&#039;ve never had issues with weight. I&#039;ve always had trouble GAINING weight. I didn&#039;t want to gain this much. No change in my exercise routine or eating habits. I had to go off of it because it was destroying my self esteem and causing depression. The withdrawals were hell, but I&#039;m gradually losing the weight I gained now that I&#039;m off of it. I&#039;m so disappointed, but hopefully I can find another med."
