"I have taken many different SSRI&#039;s for over 30 years.  All worked for quite a while, but then I have to be switched to something else.  I have been taking Viibryd for 7 months and I am going to get off of it. I had some gastrointestinal issues at first, some awful, reoccurring realistic dreams, and withdrawal symptoms when I missed a dose by a few hours.  Now I have become an angry person with frequent headaches.  My depression is the worst it has ever been.  2% of the population will have problems with a medicine, so be aware that it might not occur when you first start taking Viibryd.  My insurance would not cover Viibryd until I had a special consideration form submitted by my Doctor."
