"I have been taking paroxetine for about 2 yrs. I had dealt with social anxiety and depression my whole life and I&#039;m 51 now. I could deal with it, but when I got a promotion and needed to facilitate mtgs, training etc. I would have panic attacks and it was horrible. I had tried a couple other meds. (lexipro, Prozac and they didn&#039;t help). I feel like a new person.. I actually feel ok for the first time in my life. I don&#039;t worry about what people think of me and I can actually be happy. I am so thankful to God and this drug!!"
