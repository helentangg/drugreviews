"I tried every supplement/natural remedy under the sun to help relieve my OCD to no avail. I suffered from horrible intrusive thoughts and daily panic attacks that were driving me nearly insane. Then a friend recommended Lexapro. I&#039;ll admit the first two weeks were hell and I had every side effect under the sun. But after about 5 weeks, and an increase in dosage to 20mg, I felt back to my old self. Now I hardly have any intrusive thoughts, and when I do, they are much easier to control. I&#039;m so thankful for Lexapro, it gave me my life and happiness back.  I&#039;m now at 30mg and find this to be an effective dose for my OCD and anxiety. I hope it continues to work wonders for me!"
