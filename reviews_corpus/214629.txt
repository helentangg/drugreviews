"I&#039;ve been on 10 mg of escitalopram for almost a year.  Some days I still experience nausea.  It was very bad during the first few weeks and then it stopped.  But in the last few months I started experiencing nausea throughout the day again.  Anyone else still have nausea from this drug after being on it for awhile?"
