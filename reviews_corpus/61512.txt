"I started citalopram about a month ago and on the 6th day I felt amazing! Then about a week ago I started to decline and the horrors and anxiety and depression started to set back in :( I will say that this medicine has overall helped me in a big way, even though I am relapsing it still has a positive effect. The side effects I experienced are teeth clenching and insomnia but lack of sleep lasted for only a few days. My question to everyone is, has citalopram worked for you then stopped and then started working really well again?"
