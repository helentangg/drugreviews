"I have had panic disorders since I was 13 and it started impairing my life a year and half ago. My doctor diagnosed it and the symptoms were all spot on! I wasn&#039;t going crazy! So I&#039;ve only been on it for a week and already my hyperventilation is down 90%, I just feel so much better. I do still have anxiety but its improved a lot. I feel mellow and having a huge loss of appetite. I&#039;ve lost 2 lbs in a week because I only eat when I&#039;m hungry and not when I&#039;m anxious and trying to fill my time with something comforting! So far I&#039;m taking 25mg and next week will be bumped to 50mg. I am loving this. I feel like I can live my life again and can&#039;t wait to see how much more I improve!"
