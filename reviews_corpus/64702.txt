"For 8 years I have suffered with depression and anxiety and when I got to college the first thing I did was get diagnosed. My father refused to believe anything was wrong with me so this was my only option, to do it this way. After being put on Sertraline for about 3 months now my depression has improved dramatically and I am no longer having as many problems with social anxiety."
