"Pros: felt great quickly, kept me fairly level for a few years before poopout. 

Cons: SEVERE withdrawal and ANGER and AGITATION. Upon reflection, the past 3 years on Paxil were also filled with inappropriate anger to the point of rage, uncontrollable outbursts that I&#039;ve never experienced before. I isolated my loved ones, lost my partner and became a recluse as I feared my emotions. Didn&#039;t realize this until I reconnected with loved ones. Gained 40 lbs, despite a healthy diet and exercise. Joint pain, muscle loss. Yuck.

Had to switch to Lexapro to come off this drug, and lead an antihistamine/anti inflammatory diet (huge contributors to mood disorders--eye opening discovery). It smoothed out the ride but I still suffered &quot;Paxil Rage&quot;."
