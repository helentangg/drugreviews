"I suffer from generalized anxiety and frequent panic attacks. Been on the medication for a week now. First 6 days 5 mg, now its been upped to 10 mg. Definitely has taken the edge off, but I&#039;m in a daze/dream like state. Gonna stick it out and give it a few more weeks. Better and more stabilized mood.

Also, side effect of bad stomach pains and bathroom issues. Hoping thats also resolved soon."
