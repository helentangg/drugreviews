"I have been taking Cymbalta for about 2 months. I started out with the 30mg and now I am taking 120mg 1x day. I take Cymbalta for Depression, Diabetic Pain, Psoriatic Arthritis Pain, Fibromyalgia, Weight Loss. But I have noticed about 3 days after starting the 120mg a day my psoriasis flared up very bad. I have not added anything new to my diet. The only different was the increase of the Cymbalta. I will keep on taking the medication at that dose. I will just keep on using a lot of creams to help with the Psoriasis rash. I must also say I have been losing a lot of Weight which is a good thing."
