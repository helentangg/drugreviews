"I started taking Lexapro going on 3 weeks ago and I think it&#039;s great.  The side effects that I suffered in the very beginning were headaches but they are all pretty much gone.

I also did not put on any additional weight. I actually lost about 4 pounds. It seems to suppress my appetite. I highly recommend it."
