"Recommend for anyone with anxiety/derpression in my case depression caused by anxiety to give a go. Had previously been on citelopram fluoxtine diazapam all to which had more negative effects than positive.Been on it for 2 / 3 months now and finally feeling like my old self at times increasingly more. Would like to know if there is a natural way to even the chemical balance though? gave me diareha first week of using but my body is now used to it."
