"I have been taking this drug for 6 months. I started after a very sad time in our family and some months after this I had days where I would just breakdown and cry for no reason.  I found out that depression is in our family and has made me more aware of this disease. I fell generally better and don&#039;t have the days of sadness that I use to but have side affects of insomnia, low sex drive, dizziness and sometimes fatigue.  Overall I fell this drug has been helpful and would reccomend it to others."
