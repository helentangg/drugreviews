"I starred Prozac around 21 months ago.  It really seems to help first couple if months except for the severe migraines.  So my Dr added fiorcet.  And it helped a lot.  Until around Aug of this year I have been feeling out if control , mood swings,  easily angered,  I got hateful a lot.   Suicidal thoughts are very common and I&#039;m a recovering alcoholic but I&#039;ve been wanting to get drunk bad.  On Monday 11-27-17, my Dr changed my Prozac from 20mg twice daily  to 40mg in morning and 20 mg at bedtime.  My urge to drink  has about doubled.  
I dislike this all,  I used to be active and fit, did everything for my children and husband.  Laundry  , cooking,  clean house.  Shopping, and  Now  I&#039;m disabled and don&#039;t have a life"
