"I have been taking 50mg Pristiq for depression for 4 months and having used many different depressant medicines previously  (Zoloft, Luvox, Lexapro, Cymbalta, Effexor)- I find it to have less side effects.  I take thyroid medication (Oroxine) as well and I feel like Pristiq helps it to work better.  I have lost 10kg in four months without dieting and just a tad more exercise.  Less headaches, less backaches and aches and pains, a bit more get up and go which I need as I have 3 kids.  I&#039;m hoping that it doesn&#039;t wear off as some of the antidepressants have in the past.  It is not as &#039;strong&#039; as when I first started, but still effective in controlling mood swings and anger (and appetite)."
