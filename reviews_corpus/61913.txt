"This drug definitely decreased my anxiety and depression A LOT. At first I started on 20 mg. I took it at night because they make me very drowsy. Three months later I was bumped up to 40 mg. I am extremely tired all day, everyday. The worst side effect for me is the weight gain. I work out 5 days a week and eat extremely well. This medicine has been packing 5 lbs on me a month average. Also, I am hungry (or at least my brain wants to eat) non-stop! I&#039;m going off this medication because I talked to a nurse at my Dr. office who told me she gained 40 pounds on it. I&#039;d recommend taking it IF you don&#039;t mind gaining weight, even regardless of exercise. I&#039;m currently weening myself off of this medication after about 7 months on it."
