"I tried many other medications without help. I was so depressed and anxious I could not live my life. Pristiq is the the only thing that has helped. I am living life now with out being in a deep depression and without anxiety. The only problem is I have gained 30 pounds since starting Pristiq a year ago. I do work out, but I still gain weight. I hate the weight gain, but like living my life now."
