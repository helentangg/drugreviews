"I have been taking Viibryd for almost a month now.  I feel less lethargic before it was like I had a cloak of darkness  on.  I would literally wake up tired as I did when I went to bed.  I have slowly began to feel better and have more energy.  But the side effects are varied.  I have at least one brain zap per day and very vivid dreams but usually I forget them after I wake up.  I have also had a few bad headaches.  I believe this medicine is helping me but I am hoping the side effects decrease after awhile.  I am giving myself three months to see how my body reacts.  I will follow up my review then."
