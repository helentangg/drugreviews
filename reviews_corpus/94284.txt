"I am bipolar and have major depression issues and have been on tons of meds, to the point where I have felt like a pin cushion for these meds. Either they make me so tired I can&#039;t do nothing or they just don&#039;t work. I started taking Brintellix 3 months ago and I am on 10 mg a day. Side effects, whether I took it with food or not I would throw up almost every day ugh.....but on the up side it has made me feel like me again, not miserable and naggy looking at everything in a negative way! The nausea is still there sometimes in the morning but I will take it. So I can cope with everyday issues without freaking out and to be somewhat at peace with myself."
