"I am very happy with SERTRALINE.  My anxiety is almost non-existent. When I do feel anxious it goes away as quickly as it started. The same thing happens when I get angry. I used to hold onto it for a long time and now it goes away as soon as it starts. I feel a lot more able to handle any changes or curveballs that I get. My only complaint is having trouble falling asleep and feeling very sleepy in the middle of the day. Other than that it&#039;s great."
