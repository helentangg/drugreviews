"I finally went to the doctors in February after a combination of events (health worries, loss of a close friend and problems with teenage daughter) flipped me over to a point where I really didn&#039;t want to wake up next morning. She initially prescribed me 20mg of Citalopram daily. At first I had headaches but after about a week I suddenly felt a LOT better in myself, much more calm and it was as though the tablets had &#039;smoothed&#039; me out and got rid of the stress I used to feel about minor things. My doctor has been brilliant in not just leaving me on them but reviewing me every 6 weeks and gradually we have reduced my dosage to 10mg daily. I still feel great and am hopeful of reducing the dosage further over time."
