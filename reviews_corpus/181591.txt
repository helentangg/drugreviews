"Prozac has saved my life. I was unable to function normally and was very irritable. I have been taking it for 5 months and it is amazing. Other than not feeling hungry and feeling numb to things that formerly made me irate. I have had no bad side effects. I am finally living. Only wish I had the nerve to take it 10 years ago. I missed out on so much due to my severe depression."
