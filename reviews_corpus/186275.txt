"About three weeks ago, I began having around 20 hot flashes per day and going through night sweats about 4 times per night. About 5 days ago my doctor put me on Pristiq. He did this as my Father recently passed away and several other personal things have happened and I didn&#039;t start my period this month either. He said it would take care of the night sweats, hot flashes and depression, grief and anxiety. I have been on this pill for 5 days now. I have lost four lbs., have gone from a pk. of cigarettes per day to four cigarettes. Am only getting night sweats about twice a night and have gone from about 21 hot flashes per day to about 4. So far so good. I do feel a little tired but no agitation, no more confusion, crying and emptiness. I feel like I am slowly getting back to being me. So far, I am so thankful for Pristiq. "
