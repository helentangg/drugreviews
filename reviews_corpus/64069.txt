"I&#039;ve been on this medication for a few years now. overtime, I have noticed huge improvements in my severe social anxiety. it is much easier to get through the day! 

As far as side effects, I experienced loss in appetite and fatigue for about a week, then it all went away. 

Please don&#039;t let negative reviews scare you and give the meds a chance to do their job, it doesn&#039;t happen overnight!"
