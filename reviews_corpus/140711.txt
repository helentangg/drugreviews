"This medicine did work very well at first. I was happy again and very positive about life. After about a year however I began to experience some low days each month. These low days may have been a result of PMS not sure. I stopped taking Lexapro after about 1 1/2 years because I had gained 8 pounds since I started. I&#039;m only 5&#039;1&quot; and am very weigt conscious and could not stand this weight gain. No matter how much I watched my calories and exercised , I gained weight. I was scared that I would not stop gaining so I stopped meds. I have only been able to take off 2 pounds since I stopped. I figured why take this weight gaining med if I&#039;m still having some depressed days. Anyway now I&#039;m on Trintellix and have not gained but mood not as good."
