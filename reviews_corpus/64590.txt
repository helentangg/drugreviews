"I have been taking this medicine for 2 days so far and my panic attacks seemed to be dropped. I am reading a lot about this condition and doing whatever is necessary. Getting face to face help also helps to relieve your anxiety and stress. I have seen 3 different doctors and they all approved on these drugs so it cant be bad. I still see the symptoms that I was having before such as short of breath, feeling faint, dizzy, blurry vision, slight headaches, sweating, dry mouth( after I wake up ). But I believe I should give it more time for it. I am at the top level of my panic now. Sometimes I get crazy thoughts and get my panic hit me again. Exercising also helps during the day and try to avoid caffeine, sugary food and alcohol."
