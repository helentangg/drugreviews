"I have been taking Cymbalta for over 3 years.  When I started taking it I was working and it was making me sleepy, so doctor said to take it at night;  problem solved.  During the years I have had 3 surgeries and I have to stop taking it and I had no side effect or withdrawal symptoms.  It helps with my fibromyalgia, mild depression, and pain.  My insurance co-pay is $35, but during the donut-hole is is very expensive."
