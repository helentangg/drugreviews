"Cymbalta works very well for me.  I was very reluctant to try it because of the concerns other users have brought up re: side effects and horrors of withdrawal symptoms and talk of &quot;brain zaps.&quot;  I started Cymbalta after trials of Wellbutrin, Lexepro and Celexa within the last two years.  I was desperate to relieve my depression. I began Cymbalta in the spring of 2011.  One side effect I occasionally suffer is stomach upset/burning. Tums relieves the symptoms as well as omeprazole. The other side effect I occasionally suffer from is the flu like symptoms (withdrawal symptoms) if I forget a dose or am late with a dose.  I found the best time to take Cymbalta, for me, is at noon."
