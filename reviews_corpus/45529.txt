"There are pros and cons with Prozac. The pros: helped me a lot with generalized anxiety and obsessive thinking. It&#039;s a cheap medicine. The cons: made some emotions that I wanted to experience, a bit numb. My Mum passed away last year, and it was difficult to grieve for her because I couldn&#039;t feel the full weight of the emotion. Also, if/when coming off Prozac, the withdrawal can be difficult if not managed properly."
