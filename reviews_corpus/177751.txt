"I started this medication after I basically had a nervous breakdown in June 2013. I couldn&#039;t function as a mother, I felt scared &amp; nervous all the time, lights were too bright, sounds were too loud. I couldn&#039;t deal with all of the things that needed to be done around the house. Started out at 30mg for 2 weeks then went up to 60mg. Made me super tired in the afternoons at first. (take around 7am). Cymbalta slowly brought me out of the &#039;fog&#039; I was in, it took about 6-8 weeks before I could say I felt &#039;normal&#039; again; whatever that is, right? "
