"I was diagnosed &quot;clinically depressed&quot; 25-30 years ago and can&#039;t begin to name all the antidepressants I&#039;ve been given.  I have been on Zoloft 200mg for the past couple of years and it&#039;s working pretty well.  Lately , I have noticed I can&#039;t remember anything.  I hadn&#039;t thought about Zoloft being the culprit because I&#039;ve been on it so long with no problems.  I have never kept a journal, with side effects, likes, dislikes of drugs, but I think its time to start one.  I&#039;d like to hear others&#039; experiences with this medicine, or other &quot;popular&quot; ones. "
