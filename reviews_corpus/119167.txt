"I was previously taking Lexapro for my major depression, but once I started having panic attacks, my doctor switched me to Zoloft.  So far, the panic is gone, and my depression has similarly been suppressed.  The only problem seems to be the side effects.  I can&#039;t really eat that much anymore, and have succeeded in losing a fair amount of weight.  I also have the &quot;shakes&quot; where my hands tremble. Though, as other people have said, the effectiveness of the medicine outweighs the side effects."
