"Been on various anxiety meds but celexa is  the best.  Reluctantly went on the celexa because I have anxiety and not depression.  Celexa is a miracle pill. My anxiety is totally gone unlike taking Ativan or Xanax which was just a temporary fix.   I no longer have anxiety, my stomach feels better, no built up of anger, I participate in functions. Only draw back, you can kiss your sex life good bye."
