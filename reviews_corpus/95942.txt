"My depression is clinical but was triggered this time by traumatic events in my family including my father&#039;s diagnosis of brain cancer.  Zoloft has worked for me in the past so I decided to try it again.  The difference is almost immediate and the only side effects are some fatigue. I take 100 mg once daily (I weigh 118 lbs).  I also suffer from Panic disorder which had gone into remission but reared its ugly head when my depression re-emerged.  I take Klonopon twice daily.  I have not had a panic attack since starting both of these medicines, and other than feeling a little tired, I am coping with life again."
