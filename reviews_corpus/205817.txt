"I have been taking Zoloft for about 7 years after a serious bout of depression. I began on a 50 mg dose and was recently upped to 200 mg. It helped with depression, but left me feeling very &#039;numb&#039;. I started taking Pristiq about a month ago. I feel more normal than I have in years. I have experienced no side effects. I know everybody is different and not all SSRI&#039;s or SNRI&#039;S work the same for everyone, but Pristiq has definitely helped me feel better than I have in a very long time. It&#039;s worth a try."
