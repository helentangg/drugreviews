"5 years ago, my gastro Dr put me on this med for nerve pain. I was not having to take it each night, usually 3 to 4 nights of as little as 12mg, sometimes even less at 6.5 mg did the trick. I found that the medication made it a bit harder to wake up in the morning but I was able to sleep thru the night. I am now having trouble sleeping due to increased stress and anxiety and the medication has been helpful in helping me sleep. Only issue for me has been the dry mouth in the morning which is manageable, I also try to eat right and exercise daily which has helped my anxiety.  In reading the reviews, I can certainly relate to what many of you are going thru.  Unless you&#039;ve been thru it, people have no idea what its like."
