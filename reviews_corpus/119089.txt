"I&#039;m writing this post because I spent a lot of time researching online about zoloft side effects before I finally decided to try it for my OCD/depression.  I made a mental note to let other people considering this drug know what it was like after I tried it as well.  I was worried that it might cause weight gain and that there may be sexual side effects.  I was on this medication for 2 years and DID NOT experience weight gain or sexual side effects.  The first few months I was on it I had some stomach upset and trouble sleeping but that disappeared shortly after.  I have maintained a consistent body weight (within 5 lbs.) for years and zoloft did not seem to affect my weight at all.  I lost a few pounds at first because of the stomach upset"
