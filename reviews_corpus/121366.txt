"I can&#039;t take this drug anymore. I get all of the listed withdrawl symptoms while on the drug. If I go more than a few hours past the time I&#039;m supposed to take it I get really bad vertigo and as someone else described it &quot;Brain Zaps&quot; seems to fit the bill. To hell with this I&#039;m going cold turkey and would rather be a stark raving lunatic then live in the half life this drug has provided me with. I sleep endlessly and when I am awake I&#039;m not awake. I&#039;m numb."
