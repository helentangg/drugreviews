"Have had mild anxiety issues since early 20s. Spiralled downwards with increasing anxiety after an injury that made me unable to work. Tried mirtazapine with temporary relief, but got worse again after a few weeks and before starting Lexapro anxiety was so bad that I was unable to work and that leaving the house resulted in panic attacks. Started Lexapro on a Friday. Felt absolutely terrible until Tuesday. Nauseous (relief from Reglan though), heavy anxiety, buzzing feeling in body. Then improvement came very gradually and very slowly for the next weeks. On week 8 now and honestly feel great. The crippling anxiety that was present 24/7 is gone and only on occasions do I feel it, only much milder and never in the form of panic attacks."
