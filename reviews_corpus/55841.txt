"This medicine was WAY too strong for me.  I&#039;m 5&#039;8&quot; and 135 pounds, but the minimum dose knocked me out the first night I started taking it, I had twitchy, bizarre dreams, woke up the next morning feeling &quot;stoned&quot;, had a headache and stomachache, shaky hands and the jitters all day and my pupils were hugely dilated.  This was all just after 1 dose of the timed-release tabs.  Not a good choice for me."
