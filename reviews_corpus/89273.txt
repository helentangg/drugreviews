"I had severe depression when we moved from a house I loved in the country to a smaller house I hated by the river in a little suburb that I&#039;d always detested.  Celexa works.  Most definitely but it works too well.  After being on it for 11 years, I became emotionless.  I had no feelings either way.  It also helped me to put on 50  pounds.  At 61, I decided to stop it.  I weaned my self off by cutting the pills in half, then in quarters, then none.  The side effects are the worst of any medication I&#039;ve ever experienced....dizziness, SEVERE depression, SEVERE happiness, experiences in my head that I can only describe as &quot;zits&quot; that were instantaneous moments of dizziness or a feeling of a bug &quot;zipping&quot; by your head, fatigue, jitters."
