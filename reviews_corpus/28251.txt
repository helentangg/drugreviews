"I didn&#039;t realize how bad I was until I took this medicine!  I&#039;ll start back: for seven years, I was either pregnant or breastfeeding and my mood deteriorated the whole time.  A year before I took Lexapro, I was almost done nursing my youngest and started to get awful pelvic spasms.  Then, once I finished nursing, I developed Irritable Bowel Syndrome.  After that, anxiety attacks.  My Dr. said, &quot;We gotta put you on something&quot; so I asked for something to help calm my stomach and nerve pain in my pelvis.  I started on 5 mg, then 10 mg 2 weeks later.  It&#039;s been 4 weeks and I&#039;m seeing an amazing difference.  Pelvic pain significantly reduced, stomach eased, and I&#039;m happier and the &quot;shakes&quot; and nervousness have lessened.  Still have some dry mouth, so be prepared. A !"
