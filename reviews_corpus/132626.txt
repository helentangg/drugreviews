"I have had insomnia off on and for 20 years and have been depressed for at least ten and have insomnia and anxiety. My doctor thought I was bipolar initially but has seen my problems concurrent, and we have dismissed mania. Doxepin works great. I was on Seroquel with many side effects, but I take 200mg of doxepin in two doses, and I take Klonopin, 1mg 3 times daily. I am a recovered drug addict and am very careful about abusable substances. This combination is perfect for people like me. The only side effect I have experienced is weight gain. In the first 3 months I began taking doxepin, I gained over 50 pounds but after several months my weight plateaued and is coming off with moderate exercise."
