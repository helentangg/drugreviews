"The Doctor said it would take 10 days to 2 weeks to kick in, but at day 8 I noticed a real difference. I was on Wellbutrin for several years, and took myself off 2 years ago. But as life happens I need a happy pill again. I was having SEVERE panic attacks, which I had never had before. So glad to have my Doctor prescribe CELEXA, it&#039;s so awesome to feel normal again. The only real side effect was yawning for a few weeks. No sexual side effects at all, it&#039;s better, because I feel better. So if you are questioning it DON&#039;T for the sake of you and your loved. Try it."
