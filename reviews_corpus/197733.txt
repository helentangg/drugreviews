"My doctor prescribed Pristiq 6 months ago for major depressive disorder with anxiety. I have been on several different antidepressants but this one took the longest to work. It took 6 weeks. I was nauseated for the first month. It finally started working and I felt less depressed but lately I am very moody and irritable. Sometimes all I want to do is stay in bed and at other times I&#039;m up all night (like now - it&#039;s 3:55am). Can&#039;t take this any more. Good luck."
