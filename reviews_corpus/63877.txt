"Where do I start! Ok so I like many I have had different degrees of anxiety my whole life.  I changed jobs 2 years ago and my new boss and manager made my life very difficult.  The anxiety was out of control and a horrid pattern as well as the unexpected attacks happened over and over.  I struggle on for 2 years using beta blockers to hide my physical symptoms.   I became so exhausted with it I just felt my life was over.   I went to my doctors and they put me on this medication.  Side effects for me where headaches,  I couldn&#039;t eat and felt a little jittery but I can honestly say, I would choose that over the anxiety any day.   It&#039;s changed my life.  My advise for anyone suffering get help, don&#039;t feel ashamed it happens to the best of us."
