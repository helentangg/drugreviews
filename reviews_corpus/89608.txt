"My 4th week using Celexa. I feel GREAT! For the past 2 years I felt so unhappy for no reason, worried about everything, constant anxiety, grumpy and tired. Now I feel like a new person. I find myself smiling all the time, full of energy, positive attitude. I did feel very very tired the first two weeks on it, it made my stomach upset a little. That all stopped around the 3rd week, not a big deal. I am truly thankful for Celexa it has changed my life! I am sorry I waited so long to say something to my Doctor. If you think you need help call your Doctor now, don&#039;t wait."
