"Not good for urinary incontinence. In fact, going to a urologist very soon to seek help/surgery options for worsening incontinence. Originally went on Cymbalta for severe anxiety/chest pains, never even knew it was prescribed for &quot;leaky&quot; folks. May work for some, but did nothing for me. Also weaning off for anxiety, due to severe weight gain while taking."
