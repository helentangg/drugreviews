"I have been on Celexa for 2 months. I was very reluctant and had tried several in the past (couldn&#039;t get past the side effects). I didn&#039;t feel great the first couple weeks, but it wasn&#039;t awful. After 3 weeks, I felt better, more relaxed, and happier. I didn&#039;t feel much different, just started enjoying things more (as they should be). I smile more and laugh more - I get excited about things (I haven&#039;t felt excitement in a LONG time). I&#039;m so happy I stuck with this one and it has truly worked for me. Also, I&#039;ve had trouble accepting an anti-depressant as a treatment option because I have no reason to be depressed - great life, kids, job, husband. But, I was. I guess it&#039;s my brain chemistry, but it is what it is. This works!"
