"Prozac is my miracle medicine. I have been on 6 different antidepressants over the years and Prozac is the only one that ever helped me feel &quot;normal&quot;, with NO side effects. It is wonderful, it&#039;s hard to find an SSRI that causes no side effects for me. Prozac has been the only one and I just love it. My quality of life is much better now and I can function in a happy state of mind. Wonderful."
