"I have suffered from depression for the past 7 years of my life, not being able to preform basic functions. Sleeping all the time waking in a panic attack every time I slept. When I was awake my anxiety was so bad I had to hide from not only people but noise and light. The only thing that seemed to help was scratching at the walls. I&#039;ve tried every anti-depressant out there and nothing has worked as great as Cymbalta. It&#039;s the first time in a 7 year depression /anxiety that I could start to feel alive again and wow! does it work for anxiety and panic. Totally gone! However the depression still lurks but doesn&#039;t keep me down. Cymbalta took about 10 weeks to fully kick in."
