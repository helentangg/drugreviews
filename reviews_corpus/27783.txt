"Last winter, a number of extremely stressful events sent me into an emotional and psychological tailspin.  I began having anxiety attacks and intrusive thoughts, which were hellish.  I awoke every morning with a feeling of utter horror.  Finally, I saw a psychiatrist who prescribed Lexapro.  He warned me that the side effects could be awful and to start slowly.  I began with 2.5mg and increased by 2.5 every 5 days, or after side effects subsided.  They included:  WORSE anxiety, WORSE intrusive thoughts, extreme drowsiness during the day and a &quot;caffeinated&quot; feeling at night.  But, slowly this went away. 
1 month later, the terrible thoughts are GONE.  Anxiety almost vanished. I am coping, and sleeping well.  So, so grateful.  LIFE-CHANGING!"
