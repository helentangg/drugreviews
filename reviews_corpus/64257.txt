"I am 42. I don&#039;t really have a diagnosis but after our 3rd child at 37, something changed. What I would describe as &quot;a mood disorder&quot; stopped me in my tracks. After a lifetime of ups and downs and seasonal depression, I finally got help. 
I have always been creative, days of high energy and an eventual crash. I&#039;ve been a parent since the age of 17, so it seemed normal to run on empty. 
I am obsessive, compulsive, mind racing, loving, over bearing, and extremely defensive and emptional. The lows have helped inspire passion and the highs have kept me motivated and driven. 

I called my OBGYN after several months of extreme symptoms. Panic, paranoia, emotional break downs...etc. 
Zoloft saved my marriage and my life. 50-150mg over 4 yrs."
