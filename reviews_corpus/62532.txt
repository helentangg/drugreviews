"Since I graduated high school, I have been on a number of antidepressants.  So far Celexa is the only one that relieved my anxiety and left my sex drive alone. I&#039;ve been getting better sleep at night, but I feel a little tired during the day at times. But that definitely beats staying up all night with racing thoughts. I like it so far."
