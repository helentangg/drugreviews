"I went off Viibyrd &amp; started Brintellix 10mg. I was having severe headaches &amp;
my brain was foggy so I asked my doctor if I could drop down to 5mg. That seemed to be much better, but then I asked to take it at night and not in the AM......That was the trick, take at bedtime, I sleep well all night and have energy when I get up. I&#039;m thankful I have good insurance, but it is very very
expensive. I was just told it&#039;ll be this expensive for 7 -10 years so the company can recoup their money, then we can buy the generic....Just not until Brintellix gets their money back. That&#039;s so sad !!!! If you ask your doctor, he can give you a coupon saving you $30.00 a month for the first year which helps. I also had side effects, but their tapering finally."
