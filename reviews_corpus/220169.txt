"For years I couldn&#039;t sleep properly, i could get to sleep most nights but woke every 2-3hours or to any slight noise. 
It all caught up with me &amp; I was an anxious sleep deprived freak who was on prozac.
I went to a new Dr about constant migraines &amp; he started me on amitriptyline 75mg, the first few days I felt so weird but after a week or so it kicked in. My migraines stopped, my anxiety was so much better &amp; a strange side effect was that I could finally sleep through a whole night!
I am so grateful this drug is around, I am no longer a sleep deprived freak :D  good for my depression too mixed with 40mg prozac. YaY Endep"
