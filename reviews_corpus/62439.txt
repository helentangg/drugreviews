"I was diagnosed with Bipolar I a couple of months ago, and have already tried quite a few medicines. They all made me feel HORRIBLE! I wanted to avoid taking lithium, so my doctor tried me on Celexa for my depression and Lamictal for my mania. I&#039;ve only been taking it for a week and feel GREAT! I can&#039;t tell you how relieved I am to feel like a normal person, it&#039;s been a few years since I could actually say I feel normal. The only side effects of the Celexa I had were insomnia and the yawning, and they&#039;re both already starting to go away. I&#039;m very pleased with this medication."
