"I have taken Paxil for about 4 years.  It is a drug that I had to get used to for about 3 weeks each time the doctor increased the strength.  At first, I felt &quot;groggy&quot; and &quot;spacey&quot;.  Over time, it helps sooooo much with anxiety, irritability, anger-intense reactions, organizing my mind and allowing me to RELAX.  I have, at times, missed a day&#039;s dose and YOU DON&#039;T WANT TO DO THAT.  The following day, I was very anxious and irritable until taking it again.  I think it is a fantastic drug that has given me my life back.  I think my kids and my husband have benefitted from me being calmer, happier and able to &quot;roll with life&quot; better.  I take 40 mg. and it was initially prescribed by my gynocolgist for hormone based mood swings.  Love it.!"
