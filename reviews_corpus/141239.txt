"I had anxiety symptoms such as dreading work daily, and physical symptoms such  as lack of energy and almost a  dizziness feeling that would start a few hours into my day and continue until I was home relaxing. This medicine has improved mostly all of my symptoms, except for the occasion day that is very stressful. I would recommend to anyone, and cannot imagine going off any time soon. Hope this helps someone else."
