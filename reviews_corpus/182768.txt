"I was placed on Cymbalta for depression in 2006  worked generally for the most part for the depression then in 08 or 09 I found out that they were prescribing it for FM which I do have FM &amp; Cymbalta did absolutely nothing for pain I&#039;ve had no side effects from the drug at all none. In my research for new SSRI I came across Savella which is designed for FM &amp; I did a less than 30 days switch over from Cymbalta to Savella with 0 adverse effects or side effects( this medicine is working both for the depression &amp; the FM.) I am also taking oxycodone 2/10Mg every 4hrs (in a 24 tyme frame)-12 pills a day. I&#039;m also taking Flexeril 10 mg 3x a day &amp; ibuprofen 800 mg 3x a day, &amp; Tylenol I don&#039;t take the Tylenol because of the deaths that occurred!"
