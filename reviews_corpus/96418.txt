"Sertraline helped me get through a very tough emotional and legal situation that involved my entire social, family and work lives. A couple of years later I am still taking it because it seems to help keep things much more even for me and I don&#039;t seem to have any side effects. I am actually considering talking to my doctor about increasing the dose from 150mg to 200mg to help me keep my cool in my extremely stressful job. I also suffer from insomnia and fibromyalgia which my personal research seems to indicate are all interwoven. I use many natural therapies but the only combination that ensures a restful sleep for me is taking between 1/2 and 1 mg of lorazepam and 10mg of zolpidem along with 3 homeopathic Hyland&#039;s Calms(not Forte) tablets."
