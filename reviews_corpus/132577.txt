"Psych keeps trying to replace Klonopin and Ambien with doxepin. It is very dose dependent. Prescribed 50mg but take 10mg, splitting capsules.  Great sleep helps with anxiety next day but sedating. Non habit forming - no real &quot;good&quot; feeling.  Took last night worked great for sleep and anxiety.  Will see how today goes.  "
