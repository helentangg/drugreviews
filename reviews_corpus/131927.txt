"Effexor XR 300 mg has really worked well for me.  Although, I am gaining weight.  I previously lost 50 lbs and now it is coming back on.  My doctor thinks it has something to do with all my medicines that I am on for depression, PTSD, anxiety disorder, just to name a few.  I am hesitant of trying a different medicine, but I can&#039;t keep on gaining the weight.  It is too hard on my back."
