"This med works for anxiety but....I have been on sooo many meds.  I need it more for anxiety than depression and that is why I chose Zoloft.  It does work for the anxiety only.  Problem after taking it for a couple years is my sleep is so disrupted, I clench my jaw so bad that when I wake up I have headaches, as well as my body.  I find myself all clenched up in a ball and then my body is sore from being tense, and feel foggy headed.  Newest problem is memory issues.  I guess it is this meds.  The sex was affected some... no weight gain.  Of course when you start any medicine, you have the normal, sweating, nauseous, dray mouth, but those things go away.  You have to give all medicines time to work!!!  I am going to wean off &amp; onto Cymbalta"
