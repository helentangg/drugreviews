"This is great at helping with my headaches! There wasn&#039;t any cause for my migraines/frequent headaches and I wanted to solve the problem. It either makes them go away completely or decreases the pain dramatically so you&#039;re able to function beautifully. However, I do get dry mouth and I feel like I have to go and pee a lot. Which are two side effects and you do get tired but mostly when it&#039;s at night when you take them so it doesn&#039;t matter too much."
