"Started taking venlafaxine 75mg XR dose 4 days ago, starting on second day I was very energetic, talkative, and had dilated pupils. I think this means I am manic. I like being this way rather than being depressed and lying in bed all day. Its kind of fun to feel happy again. I have had a couple of bad headaches since I started. Have to see if they continue."
