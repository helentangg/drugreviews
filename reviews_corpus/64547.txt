"Okay, so first of all if you decide to take this medication. Make sure to set a routine time each day to take it it works best that way. Also it takes awhile to fully kick in, for me about after 4 complete months of not missing a 50mg dose I started to feel the good effects from it. Seriously! you have to continually take it on a scheduled time to feel the good effects from the meds. After dealing with stress and anxiety after a few bad years I finally decided I needed some type of medication.After trying everything else medication was my last resort but man I wish I strarted it sooner! I&#039;m about 6 months in on a 50mg dose and I&#039;m starting to feel alive again. Enjoying things I used to take joy in but lost it when my depression hit."
