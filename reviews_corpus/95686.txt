"I am 17 years old and I have just started taking Zoloft 25 mg for 2 days for stress, depression, anxiety and insomnia. The first night I took it at 6. I felt high, my pupils were big, and I couldn&#039;t stop smiling. When I woke up for school in the morning I was half awake and half asleep. Don&#039;t remember shutting my alarm off and getting out of bed. I had yawning episodes all day. And I also felt very happy. Some of these side effects suck, but I&#039;m sticking it out. Hope it continues to make me feel happy!"
