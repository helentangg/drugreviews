"I starting taking Zoloft after speaking to my doctor about my problems -- irritability, sadness, loss of sex drive, poor body image, etc.  She suggested we try this medication for one year at 50 mg a day.  Within 2.5 weeks, I started feeling better. I wasn&#039;t mad all the time and even managed to have sex again after a nine month hiatus. I felt much more confident and in control of my emotions. I even managed to lose 15 pounds and am still losing. I have experienced no side effects whatsoever."
