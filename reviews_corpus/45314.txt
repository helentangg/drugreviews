"I take fluoxetine for OCD and mild depression. It has helped me so much. It took a while to work for me (about 2 months to fully kick in). It has been so worth it. I just feel a lot more relaxed and things don&#039;t bother me as much. I have bad side effects - mainly insomnia or over sleeping, lack of energy, diarrhoea.. but it is 100% worth being able to get out of bed in the morning. I have started being able to laugh for the first time in years. I would really recommend it for anyone who is unsure - I would say give it a go but give it time to work. Also- be very careful if drinking alcohol - it affects you a lot more."
