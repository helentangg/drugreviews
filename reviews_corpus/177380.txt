"I began taking Cymbalta 30 mg on 07-07-16 due to moderately severe depression, anxiety and physical pain. Almost immediately I felt better in all aspects; however, severe chronic constipation also occurred. I took Miralax daily and still only had BMs every two to three days. Then about two to three weeks ago I started feeling angry as if I was backsliding. I was going to increase from 30 mg to 60 mg but my doctor wanted to prescribe a medication for idiopathic constipation, which mine wasn&#039;t. My last dose of Cymbalta was on 09/30/16 and I started taking Zoloft 50 mg again on 10/1/16.  I guess one can&#039;t have it all. Even taking Zoloft causes constipation but I take 20 billion probiotic twice daily and it moves things along regularly."
