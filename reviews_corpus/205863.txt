"Since I have been sick, I have been through tons of medication. Most of which I had bad reactions too. With my condition, my depression got worse and mood swings started to occur. My doctor had tried putting me on an anti-depressant before, one that landed me in the E.R. So I was skeptical about trying something else but, when I did decide to try the Pristiq. At least I had some side effect, nothing big. It was probably me just adjusting but, finally when I had. My doctor started noticing a huge difference and so did I. I smiled more and cried less."
