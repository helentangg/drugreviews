"I take Citalopram for anxiety and depression. Before I started taking it, I had daily panic attacks and could not function very well. I&#039;ve been on it now for four months. I highly recommend this medicine. My panic attacks have gone down to weekly. My dad starting taking it too and it helps him as well for bad depression. I started at 10mg. I took that for two months and now I&#039;m doing great on 20mg. You may have some side effects at first, BUT everyone I know who had taken it has not had long lasting side effects. Two weeks or so is about it."
