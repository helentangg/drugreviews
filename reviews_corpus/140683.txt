"Hormones may play an important part of how well you tolerate. At age 37 &amp; hormonally balanced it worked well for situational depression within 14 days. Minimal, short side effects upon starting. Used 5-6 months then weaned off. Absolutely satisfied! Ten years later - perimenopausal, panic attacks, OCD, GAD and depression. Tried drug again and had horrible reaction! Even on 1/8 dose. The floor was unstable, naseau, headache, ears almost deaf. Scared me so bad, I refused to take anything for my symptoms for several years. Now postmenopausal and 15 days on generic lexapro, I feel great. No side effects."
