"I have been on Brintellix for a year now and this drug has definitely had a positive impact on my quality of life. The profound sadness that was my unwelcome partner for many years has for the most part dissipated. On most days, my mood is good, but the strange thing is that even though my mood is not depressed, I have little motivation to do activities that would bring me pleasure. I very rarely engage in hobbies, watch TV, read books, listen to audio books, or exercise, so I have a lot of free time in which I do nothing. Amazingly, my mood still remains relatively stable. But it is a frustrating mindset and so I&#039;m going to ask my psychiatrist to lower the Brintellix or adjust one of my four other psychotropic meds I also take daily."
