"Ever since I was young I have been constantly worried and anxious. I also had an eating disorder, and I was put on Zyprexa for food related anxiety. Zyprexa made me into a zombie, but once I recovered I took Zoloft for my anxiety and love it! It has put all of the little worries in my life into perspective and helped me handle disappointment and stress much better. I don&#039;t get hungry very often, but I rarely feel nauseous. My social life has gone up a lot since I&#039;ve taken this, and I sleep like a baby at night. My only complaint is that I get incredibly energetic and distracted easily and do not respond well if I don&#039;t take it for a couple days. Love it though!"
