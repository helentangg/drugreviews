"Life transforming.
I&#039;ve always resisted the idea of medicating mental states, but after a year of utterly out-of-control and misery-making anxiety, I was persuaded to give it a try.
Within two weeks my levels of anxiety had dropped significantly, three months in I feel positive and able to cope with my enormously stressful work situation. This medicine has transformed my mental state.
I do feel more tired on it, and am perhaps experiencing a certain loss of mental sharpness, but that&#039;s a price I am happy to pay in exchange for despair, panic and regular suicidal thoughts.
I never expected to find myself buying into &quot;big pharmaceuticals will make you happy&quot;, but this has helped me regain control of my life."
