"I have severe nerve pains in my hands and feet. I am not diabetic, my doctor tried me on 60mg. By the 7th day I had my wife call the doctor and advise that I would like to discontinue use. I take a lot of different medication for different medical problems and can tolerate them well but this &quot;Cymbalta&quot; was different. It made me feel disconnected, my body was here and my mind was out there somewhere, like have tunnel vision. Did not like this medication. "
