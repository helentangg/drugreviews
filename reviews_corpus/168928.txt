"Noticed a great improvement after two days on this medicine. A little restless legs syndrome but not bad then the brain zaps or electrical surges started. It scared me so badly. But I thought it was just due to a short night with little sleep and maybe the half of a beer I had before bed? But this evening, it happened again... Calling the Dr ---Dont think I want to experience these anymore!"
