"I feel very conflicted about this medication. For about 80% of the day it helps me to be more stable and less reactionary. But then every day or every other day I have a breakdown and start sobbing, get very moody and paranoid, accuse my partner of not loving/caring about me, want to self harm and die. It has helped my chronic pain and doesn&#039;t cause me to dissociate constantly like many antidepressants do. However, I&#039;m not sure it&#039;s worth it because of the breakdowns, but I&#039;m scared to go off of it because I heard withdrawal is awful. I am just about ready to give up on medication altogether at this point."
