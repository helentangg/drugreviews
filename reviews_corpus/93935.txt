"When started- slight upset stomach, moderate constipation.
6 weeks into it- constipation
I&rsquo;m eating a cup of fruit and drinking 2 cups of warm tea for breakfast. Takes care of the constipation.
After 20 years of depression and anxiety I want to tell anyone reading this that healthy eating and exercise are your best bet. Medication only helps. Rated Trintillex a 7. It got me back to where I need to be, but as with most medications it comes with side effects."
