"I am a RN who suffers from severe social anxiety and moderate depression.  Symptoms associated with SAD have included inability to write in front of others, eat in public, public speaking.  Even drinking in front of others was difficult for me.  I hated the shaking, heart racing/pounding, and everything else that went along with this horrible affliction! I remember it all starting around 15 years old but never could understand why.  I&#039;m 41 yrs old today and my anxieties have affected my life negatively and held me back in so many ways.  I never felt normal.  Many years and meds later, I came to believe my life would never change.  That I would never feel &quot;normal&quot; around people. Then I found Cymbalta..changed my life!"
