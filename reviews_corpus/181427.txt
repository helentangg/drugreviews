"Suffered with depression since early teens, but hit rock bottom when a friend committed suicide, I could no longer work, couldn&#039;t eat, had panic attacks and became suicidal. After 3-4 weeks of taking Prozac I began feeling like a normal person and after 6 weeks I felt happier than I could ever remember being for years. Prozac has saved me, will happily stay on it for life if this is how it makes me feel."
