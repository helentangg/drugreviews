"I have been on Pristiq for 9 months. Previously I was on Cymbalta to help with depression and fibromyalgia. Pristiq seemed to help somewhat at first (for a few months) but then the suicidal thoughts returned. I&#039;m now being taken off Pristiq (slowly). It just isn&#039;t working any more and I&#039;m still in deep depression. So thankful that my doctor is switching me to something else. "
