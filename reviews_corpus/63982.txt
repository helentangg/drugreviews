"I&#039;ve been on 175mg Sertraline for 3 weeks now. The first two weeks were not great with heightened anxiety on some days, some brain fog but I also experienced some good days. My depression lifted almost completely. I started at 25mg 10 weeks ago and slowly moved up. Each time I moved up a experienced the heightened anxiety and brain fog. The last 5 days I have been feeling much better. I wake up with anxiety and nervousness which I believe is now just a habit I have to change but the anxiety lifts much faster than previous. I&#039;m going to report back in a few weeks but I would say I&#039;m already 80% better."
