"For those of you experiencing fatigue, it would make sense to take Cymbalta at night. This is how I have dealt with fatigue with many medications and was also the advice of my doctor. ALSO, for those with side effects that are bothersome, I was advised to give it more than a week because they usually dissipate. Don&#039;t stop taking it after only a few days!"
