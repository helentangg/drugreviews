"I was on Cymbalta for two years.  I had no side effects and it worked really well for my anxiety.  I had no sexual side effects which was great.  I decided to go off of it thinking that I didn&#039;t need it anymore.  I thought that I tapered it by taking 20mg for a month.  Once I started taking 20mg every other day it was like experiencing the withdrawal symptoms over again each time.  I finally just stopped taking it and had awful withdrawal symptoms.- more monitoring would have helped."
