"I have been depressed for two years, developed illnesses, allergies etc. even asthma due to my depression. My doctor prescribed STALOPAM (same as USA&#039;s Lexapro in India). I have been on it for just over a week now. I have noticed amazing changes in me. There have been moments when I start feeling like normal me. Side effects are lack of sex drive, but when I do get going the experience is great. Sleep is disturbed, though I want to get more sleep. Feel a bit of mania, high energy at times. Grinding teeth, etc. Overall the good effects far out weigh the bad ones. My allergies also seem to get relieved with this."
