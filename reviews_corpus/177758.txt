"Tried most antidepressants, and I was ready to give up. I was tired of trying antidepressants, getting sick while I waited for the positives, only to find out it didn&#039;t really help.  I&#039;ve tried Prozac, Paxil (good but stopped working for me), Zoloft (allergic to it), Effexor, Citalopram (worst of all).  I don&#039;t know what made me ask my doctor for Cymbalta, but I did. It started working the second day I took it!  I have been slowly recovering from depression and getting my life back.  I hope the same for the people who read this.  Never give up hope!"
