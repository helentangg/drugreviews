"I&#039;ve had migraines with aura since my early 20s (I&#039;m 45 now). Over the past few years their frequency had increased.  As of December 2013, I was having them about 2- times per week.

I was put on Nortriptyline 50 mg/day.  I have had only one migraine in the past 14 months (and the one I had was when I tried to reduce the dosage).

The dry mouth &amp; orthostatic hypotension have stopped.  The only problem is that I really cannot drink very much alcohol."
