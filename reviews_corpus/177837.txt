"I take Cymbalta for both dysthymia and fibromyalgia.  I am a female in my mid-40&#039;s.  Overall, I am at least 70% better than before taking Cymbalta, though not pain-free.  I find that I get maximum benefit when I take 120 mg (two 60 mg. capsules at same time) of Cymbalta daily, combined with enough sleep and daily exercise (e.g. at least 20 mins. brisk walking).  Also, I need to avoid/minimize physical and psychological stressors (including unpleasant people)."
