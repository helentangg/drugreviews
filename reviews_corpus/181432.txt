"I was on 10mg Prozac for general anxiety and panic attacks for 2 years. I had no side effects and my panic attacks decreased tremendously. However I recently started having them again so my doc worked me up to 40mg/day. I feel happy. But I feel like it is too much. I don&#039;t feel love anymore, and I feel like my emotions are so flat that although I&#039;m not getting the panic attacks, I would almost rather deal with them than be unable to feel emotions. I have been dating a guy for 2 years, and all of a sudden after being on 40mg daily for six weeks I don&#039;t feel like I&#039;m in love with him anymore. I can&#039;t tell if it is because of the medication or if it is actually me. I will be talking to my doc about decreasing my dose to 20mg."
