"Doctor prescribed me Prozac &amp; asked that I attend group therapy to help any underlying issues. My depression came out in the form of anger - EVERYTHING annoyed me for no reason.

At first, I felt no different taking the medication. After a few months, my brother was the person to realize that it was working. He pointed out that we had been getting along &amp; very little seemed to annoy me anymore. 

Side effects: I was in a haze. For example: I would be driving and could completely miss the street I was suppose to turn on to &amp; wouldn&#039;t realize it until 3 miles later. Most people describe themselves as a zombie in this haze.

With Prozac &amp; therapy, I was on Prozac for about a year."
