"The first three days seemed promising, then I began having anxiety jolts.  It was tolerable.  The anxiety jolts are constant and start around 1pm.  If I get stressed or tense the agitation kicks in. I can&#039;t tolerate it, I have two small children and you can imagine your patience is being tried anyhow.  My goodness I am wiped out and I get emotional after the agitation period. I stopped taking Celexa and began taking 40mgs Viibryd.  This morning I backed down the dosage to 20mgs in hopes of feeling better.  I tried calling my doctor today. I want my Celexa back. I at least wasn&#039;t having the all above. I wanted to feel better but Viibryd isn&#039;t it.  I can&#039;t imagine that it is going to get better."
