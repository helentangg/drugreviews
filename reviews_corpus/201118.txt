"This medication saved my life. In 2015, my depression and anxiety were so horrible. I was sad and/or angry all the time and I was having 1-3 panic attacks a day. I&#039;ve been suffering with depression since about 4th grade (I&#039;m almost 21 now) but my anxiety didn&#039;t really get aggressive until I was a sophomore in high school. After I graduated is when it became a really big problem for me. I stopped taking Zoloft in 2015 after a few months because I lost my insurance. I got put back on it in May of 2016. It&#039;s been nearly a year and I&#039;m a brand new person. Happier, funnier, more full of life, more excited about life, I feel incredible! I only have about 1 panic attack every 2-4 months and my mood is positive and amazing! So happy to have this"
