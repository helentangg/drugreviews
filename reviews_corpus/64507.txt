"I was recently diagnosed with GED. I&#039;ve been researching, learning as much as i can about the disorder and the drugs that can help us all. I was placed on Sertraline 25mg for two weeks about two months after a what can only be described as a week long life altering experience of Paxil. I am currently on day 6 of 25mg and couldn&#039;t take the side effects anymore. I experienced headaches, dizziness, small panic attacks out of nowhere, chest pain, reflux, nausea, fidgeting, i cant stop yawning, loss of appetite. basically the full list of known side effects. Going to visit the doctor tomorrow to see if I should cut it down for good or try something else.

everyone says &quot;stick it out&quot; but I don&#039;t think I can do that to myself or my family."
