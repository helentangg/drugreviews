"I had 3 to 4 migraines a week and was sleeping very badly.
2 weeks into taking amitriptylne and the migraine gone.
I&#039;m sleeping at least 7 hours a night too.
I don&#039;t know if this will last, but it&#039;s working brilliantly at the moment. The initial tiredness side effect stopped 1 week in."
