"I have spinal stenosis in 2 levels of my lumbar spine and 3 bulging/protruding discs. I could hardly sit or walk for months. I was hoping for surgery just to ease the pain. I couldn&#039;t drive for longer than 15 minutes, couldn&#039;t exercise like I used to, could hardly work. My doctor put me on Cymbalta 2 weeks ago and within 10 days, almost all my pain is gone! I still have some numbness in my lower leg and foot but I am no longer taking Percocet and am weaning off the morphine for night time! Cymbalta gave me back my life! I hope it continues! Thank you for this wonderful medicine!"
