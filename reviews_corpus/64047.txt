"I started this medication in 2015 on 25mg for 2 weeks - it had no effect which was good as I also had no side effects (I was in a pretty bad place at the time as I had pnd, panic disorder and ptsd) so I wasn&#039;t expecting to feel better straight away.
I was then increased to 50mg and started feeling a lot better after about a month.  I then increased to 75mg - what I&#039;m on now, and I can honestly say my life is just so much better!! The only side effect I have noticed is a bit of a fuzzy head if I don&#039;t take the meds at the same time every day.  
It is a medication that can take a few months to really show you it&#039;s benefits But it shouldn&#039;t make you worse -So like any drug... be careful and talk to your prescriber regularly!"
