"I&#039;ve been taking 75mg for a little over a month, I&#039;ve seen a positive difference for sure! There are so many bad reviews on the drug and it made me worry but being on it has really changed my life in ways. My depression is so much better, I don&#039;t take as many naps as I used to, my headaches are a little better, and it&#039;s even helped me with irritable bowel syndrome. It&#039;s still hard to focus sometimes, but not bad. I don&#039;t have many side effects on 75mg -- I have crazy dreams sometimes but it&#039;s not bad! And I think I might be a bit more hungry. Although, if I miss a dose by a few hours I will definitely feel it. I start to get a migraine and have to take the med right away. 
This really worked for me and I hope it could help someone else!"
