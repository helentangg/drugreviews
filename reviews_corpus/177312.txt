"I was on 30 mg for GAD and insomnia.  After a month or so, I became so hyper and my insomnia went from only sleeping a few hours every day to having days of no sleep. Ativan, which had always helped me sleep, no longer worked. My thoughts were scattered, often terrifying so it was good they were brief I guess (it &quot;cured&quot; the anxiety, as I couldn&#039;t worry about something before the thought of it was just gone), I couldn&#039;t focus, became unable to work at all. I was weaned off about two weeks ago, still can&#039;t function at all. I am a bit better now than when on it, but far worse than I was before. I wish I never touch this stuff, I feel like I will never get my life back again, certainly never my career."
