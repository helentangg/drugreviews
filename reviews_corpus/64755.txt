"I originally was on low dose Celexa for about 7-8 weeks and it was AWFUL. I fell asleep driving SEVERAL times, became a zombie and withdrew from socializing. I tapered it very carefully but still had severe withdrawals that almost ruined my life. 3 months after the taper I became increasingly anxious, causing me to have depression, extreme daily panic attacks and obsessive negative thoughts. I felt hopeless bc I had such a terrible experience with the Celexa. I felt like any SSRI would be impossible for me. I went to my doctor in tears (I cried every single day, several times a day) and he put me on 50mg Zoloft daily. I had &quot;discontinuation syndrome&quot;. Zoloft saved my life and my relationship. I felt a huge difference in just 2 days!"
