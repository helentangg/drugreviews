"Pretty average. I personally don&#039;t find SSRI/SRNIs do much for anxiety. I was up at 300mgs of effexor SR  for 3 months and still had panic attacks. Took it down to 150mg as I think was inducing hypomania. I&#039;ve been gaining weight on this. They say low weight gain but I&#039;m gaining weight. I&#039;ve gained approximately 5 kgs in 3 months despite normal diet. Sexually it&#039;s not as bad as some other SSRIs but it&#039;s not great either.  Increased sweat. I just don&#039;t know how effective these drugs are in treating anxiety. I&#039;m starting trileptal as I also have BP2 type symptoms in addition to anxiety. Also on clonazapam 1.5mg but I don&#039;t recommend that either(Addictive). Everyday meditation has given me the best success sofar."
