"First put on antidepressants in 1997. I started on Zoloft later switched to Paxil - then weaned myself off both and didn&#039;t need antidepressants for almost 6 years. Became peri-menopausal in 2005 and had to go back on Zoloft for moderate to severe anxiety and depression. My anxiety is debilitating and overshadows every aspect of my life when it starts to take hold. I have tried lots of alternative methods to treat my anxiety, but nothing works as well as anti-depressants. I went off Zoloft last year in May 09 and about 6 months later the anxiety and depression crept back. A neurologist (thought I was dying from a brain tumor) prescribed Lexapro. I&#039;ve been on 5mg for a month. It has helped my anxiety A LOT but feel tired and spacey. Maybe need 10mg?"
