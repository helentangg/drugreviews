"3 Months and so far this drug has helped me more than PT, steroid shots, yoga, massage, traction, ibuprofen and patience. The side effects were challenging to begin with, but once the first few weeks had passed by, I was feeling pretty normal and back to my old self again. I can&#039;t describe how grateful I am for this medication and it&#039;s helped me to no end. Don&#039;t believe all the negative reviews, but take note of the positive reviews too."
