"After 2 weeks, this crap called medication made my OCD WORSE, Then a few weeks later i was so depressed that i couldn&#039;t even get out of bed. I went from being a healthy lady with moderate ocd, to a majorly depressed obese pig in 2 months.
Thanks prozac. 
Dont put this depression (causing) pill down your throat. Talk to your doctor about other options.

Also, i just want to let you all know something, 50% of psychiatrists will do anything to make their appointment with you quicker, even if that includes just opening their book of medications and picking a random one in your category (in my case, ocd). Always try medication free solutions BEFORE popping a pill. eg, ocd training, therapy, natural treatments, etc"
