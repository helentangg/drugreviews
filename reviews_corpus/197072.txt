"I suffer from anxiety daily and mild depression. I was on Paxil for 2 years and thought I was okay to get off it, 2 months later I fell hard into depression and anxiety and recently went back on it and waiting for it to kick in again. This medicine is a life saver for sure. Don&#039;t give up on it in a few days. You have to let it kick in. Hopefully it&#039;ll kick in soon for me! On it I had no anxiety and I suffered daily before it, had no depression.  Good luck :)"
