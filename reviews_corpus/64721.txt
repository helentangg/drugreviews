"Growing up I always exhibited symptoms of OCD, however, my mother didn&#039;t believe that medication was the best route at a young age. I respected her decision throughout adolescence and tried to cope with my OCD on my own, using different vitamins such as b complex, etc. I met the love of my life last year and everything was wonderful until my relationship OCD kicked in with a vengeance. It almost ruined my relationship and my life, but I decided to seek professional help. My psychiatrist started me on Zoloft in June and I cannot express how much my life has changed because of it. I am a kinder person, and I can focus on the people and things I love, instead of constantly worrying about my health, relationship, etc. I highly recommend it!"
