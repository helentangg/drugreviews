"I started taking sertraline about 9m ago. I&#039;ve been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. I was having massive highs and lows, psychotic episodes, trouble sleeping all the time &amp; basically couldn&#039;t control my emotions in any way. Life was extremely difficult, but I&#039;d lived like this for so long, I think I convinced myself it was normal. I had some side effects like nausea, my vision became crystal clear, had some headaches &amp; was tired all the time. I started sleeping like a baby, and after about a month, all the side effects were gone! I&#039;m so calm &amp; nothing really bothers me any more. It saved my mind and my relationship. Remember that not everyone will feel the same, so keep trying until you find the one which works for you."
