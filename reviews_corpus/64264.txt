"I started Zoloft 13 days ago. I have terrible anxiety and panic disorder. My anxiety was getting so bad that I could no longer go to work, be around friends, or even my boyfriend. I&#039;d have at least 1-4 panic attacks a day. I have always been terrified of being on medicine because I have a fear of feeling high or feeling a little off (which sends me into a full blown panic attack) Up until yesterday, I felt heightened anxiety after starting the pills (25mg for the first week, 50mg by week two), extremely exhausted, my sleep patterns have been totally off...BUT yesterday, I felt good. I didn&#039;t have a panic attack all day. And today, I got into a situation that made me start to feel an attack coming on and I was able to rationalize and stop it"
