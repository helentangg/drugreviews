"I have been taking Cymbalta 60 mg for about 3 years. At the beginning, I was lightheaded and actually lost about 10 lbs. Over the last year or so, I have become increasingly lethargic - just tired all of the time and have gained about 15 lbs. Have decided to wean off to get some energy back and hopefully lose some weight. It worked for my depression for a while, but has lately lost a lot of effectiveness."
