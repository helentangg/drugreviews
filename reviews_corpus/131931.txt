"After having my ovaries removed, the hot flashes were so bad - one every hour or so - that I could not get a decent nights sleep.The doctor had said if the flashes got bad that I could try this antidepressant. I did not need that or so I thought. After a month I said okay I&#039;ll try it. I have been on the lowest dose for about 8 years now. Am I done with the hot flashes - I don&#039;t know and don&#039;t want to find out. And the side benefit for me is that is also took the edge off of stress and worrying. I recommend every woman who can&#039;t take hormones and has hot flashes to try this. I have had no side effects but I did have loss of appetite. Just make sure your doctor checks your liver functions yearly."
