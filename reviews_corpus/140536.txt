"I&#039;ve had life long crippling anxiety, my doctor first recommended escitalopram to treat my GAD after several hospitalizations from panic attacks. I was really hesitant but it&#039;s been the best decision ever. I feel normal for the first time in my life. The first few weeks were a little rough because it made me extremely tired and drowsy, but I was just relieved not to feel anxious. It&#039;s been a lifesaver. I can leave my house, I can eat, I can sleep, I can go out with friends &amp; I haven&#039;t had a panic attack in months. I have gained about 15 lbs but that&#039;s the only negative I&#039;ve noticed."
