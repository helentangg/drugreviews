"After trying a few SSRIs that didn&#039;t work (Paxil, Lexapro) and a very bad stint with Remeron (ended up collapsing one night on my 3rd week, all the while my sleep was getting worse).  Withdrawals from Remeron put me in a black hole.  I nearly gave up.  Started Zoloft and Ativan 1mg for sleep.  Headaches, dizziness, and exhaustion for several weeks (could also be the underlying depression) but I finally got stable enough to leave my parents house and get my life together.  Medication didn&#039;t really help my sleep (no antidepressant has) but it did help my social and general anxiety.  Marked somnolence and felt very apathetic on it.  No lows, but no highs.  Helped GAD/SAD but not depression.  I&#039;m sensitive to meds and I tolerated this one well."
