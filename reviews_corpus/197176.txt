"I have been on Paxil twice in my life. When I was teenager, my doctor prescribed me Paxil to control depression. I was on it until I started my Master&#039;s. I stopped taking it because I did not think that I needed it anymore. For about five to six years, I wasn&#039;t taking Paxil, but I noticed that my anxiety got worse. It got so bad that I began to get panic attacks almost every morning. I also developed an ulcer and was diagnosed with severe Irritable Bowel Syndrome. My doctor decided to place me back on Paxil. After being on for 6 months, I feel absolutely wonderful. I still get anxious every once in awhile but not to the point that I feel as though I&#039;m going to have a panic attack. I&#039;ve also been able to control my panic attacks on my own."
