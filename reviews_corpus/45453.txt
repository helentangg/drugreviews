"Started with awful upset stomach, but that&#039;s now passed and we&#039;ve progressed to a constant nagging headache that painkillers won&#039;t touch. Also feeling shaky with it, physically gittery- but these are all common symptoms so I&#039;m sticking with it as in the long run these symptoms will fade. I&#039;m on 20mg daily, my appetite has vanished so forcing myself to eat. Sleep is disturbed by weird dreams and general restlessness. So overall feeling exhausted. Sticking with it, feeling positive that once my body adapts I will feel the effects!"
