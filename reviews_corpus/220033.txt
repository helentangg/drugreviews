"About 3 months ago I started experiencing thunderclap migraines. My doctor put me on Atenolol which did nothing for me. She then put me on Amitriptyline 25 mg which has pretty much eliminated the migraines. I guess I was somewhat depressed because now I feel wonderful, patient, and have a sense of well being. My emotions seem to have levelled out. I have experienced some not so pleasant side effects such as vivid bizarre dreams, blurry vision, constipation and dry mouth. 
I kept hearing about serious weight gain but due to my new found satisfaction in life I don&#039;t turn to food for comfort anymore so I&#039;ve lost weight on this medicine!
I love what this medicine has done for me."
