"I have been on fluoxetine for 3 years and 4 months ago I decided to stop taking them after I thought I was ready to get on without them. I had often forgot to take them so I thought oh well I&#039;ve weaned myself off them.  Big mistake!    I have gone through so much mind blowing experiences in last 3 months.  Now been back on them for 6 days on 20 mg and I will be happy when I stop feeling how I do at the moment.  Never thought I&#039;d be thinking I&#039;d gone crazy and feel like the whole of lincolnshire have got this one big conspiracy theory going on against me.lol I know !   Crazy but that&#039;s how my head is thinking at moment.  Thank you for reading this and i do hope it makes sense to you if you going through this same thing it will get better."
