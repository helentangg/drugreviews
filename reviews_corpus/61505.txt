"I&#039;ve always struggled with depression and anxiety attacks since I was 18 (now 28) and having used citalapram a few times, it has always really helped me.
I was at a point my life where I felt I couldn&#039;t go on anymore with all the stuff constantly going on in my head!! With two small children to look after I honestly felt that they would be better of without a mother that used to curl up at nights crying into a pillow because she couldn&#039;t see a way out of it. But I did! 
I don&#039;t want to jinx it but this medicine has saved my life
Everyone reacts differently to it mind, and the first few weeks of taking it are awful! My anxiety increased to breaking point,  but you have to stick with it because side effects don&#039;t last.. hope this helps.."
