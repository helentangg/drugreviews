"It&#039;s week three. Let me start by saying this is my third try at a different depression/anxiety med. And it actually seems to be working. Also I&#039;ve went from 290 at the dr. Office to 276 in 3 weeks I&#039;m 6&#039;2&quot; so it&#039;s noticeable. I use to stress eat, now I don&#039;t have the urge to constantly eat. I feel, not full, just in hungry and fine with it? Overall I give it a 9/10 the 1 is because it&#039;s only been 3 weeks. Kicks in quick(two weeks for me), go all day with no need for xanax or ativan. I&#039;m also alot  less angry. Hope this helps, explore all options. Everyone&#039;s different! Never lose faith and force a smile :)"
