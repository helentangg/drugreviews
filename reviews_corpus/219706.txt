"I&#039;ve been on amitriptyline for one month now; it was given to me for migraine prevention and insomnia.

After the first few weeks, I filtered out the adjustment side effects and looked at what was left.  It didn&#039;t prevent migraines, it just delayed them.  Hit a trigger, get a quick pain blast, a tingle, and the migraine would set in a few hours later. 31 days, 16 with migraines.  A sleep efficiency of 52%, almost never in blocks lasting an hour, averaging just over 4 hours per night.  Raised blood pressure. Toward the end, walking black outs. In the 3rd week, starting having constant paranoia. The blackouts did it, though. I see the neurologist tomorrow and ask to be taken off; I&#039;m worse on it than I was without it."
