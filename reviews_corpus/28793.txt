"I love this medicine! I was first on 10mg and had something very bad happen so my doctor gave me 20mg. I really did not have any side effects until I started taking 20mg, I got the worst night sweats and couldn&#039;t sleep. So my doctor took me off cold turkey. Please if you decide to go off this medicine, please taper off. I went crazy, really I did. I felt like screaming, I&#039;m so dizzy, can&#039;t sleep and I feel like I&#039;m having a break down. And the brain zaps are so bad. Like I said this medicine made me feel like a new person and I wish I could stay on it but those night sweats. So now I&#039;m going to try Pristiq, wish me luck I start tomorrow."
