"I have BPD, anxiety disorder, and agoraphobia.  This medicine didn&#039;t do much for me.  I got all of the side effects but none of the relief.  I am only giving it a mid-line rating because I can&#039;t seem to tell if the medicine didn&#039;t help or if I am just more depressed/stressed lately."
