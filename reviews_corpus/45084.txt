"I have Obssessive Compulsive Personality Disorder, Anxiety, Anger.  I Came off 8 years of venlafaxine with a week of headaches, increased fluid loss, dehydration and difficulty concentrating.  1st day of fluoxetine seemed at first to be similar to past week.  After 5 hours, my mind started to feel a little dizzy with accompanying nausea.  By evening, nausea heightened and appetite decreased.  Next day, within 1 hour, I felt the full effects:  vertigo, metallic taste/smell, nausea, alertness, and heart flutter.  Within 5 hours, I could no longer remain at a workstation, feeling very dizzy.  GP ordered rest, I went home and laid up.  The second evening/night:  difficulty falling asleep, violent dreams, electrical pulses in brain, anxiety.  Third morning: extreme tiredness, brain pulses continuing, vertigo."
