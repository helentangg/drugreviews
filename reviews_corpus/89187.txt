"So for months I have been having severe anxiety and panic attacks. I finally went to the doctor because it has made my life a living hell on a day to day basis and depression has started to creep in from being so stressed out over having the anxiety itself. I was prescribed citalopram 20mg but after reading reviews I let it sit on my counter for 2 weeks for fear of taking it and making my anxiety even worse. Yesterday I finally said screw it and  took 1/4 of a pill (5mg) to start. I was at the point where I&#039;m just sick of having anxiety every day and nothing,  not even the side effects could be worse. I didn&#039;t have any weird reactions. I did get really sleepy about 2 hours after taking it but it was late evening so I didn&#039;t mind."
