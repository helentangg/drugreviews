"Started on 30mg for about 3 months, not much help.  Upped to 60mg, no help. Now on 90mg for one month and my depression is even worse that it was. I slipped into a major down a few days ago, one of the worst I&#039;ve had in years and have yet to bounce back from it. I have had mild brain zaps here and there since going to 90mg.  Anyway, I am guessing my psychiatrist will try something different.  I have tried Lexapro (helped me for many years, then seemed to stop working). Wellbutrin (made me very irritable), and Pristiq (did nothing except lower my libido and give me a little bit of energy)."
