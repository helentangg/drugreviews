"Well after trying a few medications to help with my insomnia this one worked. About 15 min after taking it i got bad dry mouth. And this continues every time I take it. But it works. It works very well. The only bad thing is I wake up shaky and I have this awful rash on my face that goes from the middle of my forehead down the mid cheek area on both sides of my face. I have never had acne so I am assuming it is a side effect. I will find out tomorrow when i go see my doctor about it..I hope it is not though since this medication works."
