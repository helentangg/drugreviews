"On 6th week of Viibryd. It starts with a jump. Then tapers down and up a bit; then levels off and is decently effective. It&#039;s more sedating than Cymbalta and its a pain to eat in the am. However, so far it&#039;s weight neutral and I&#039;ll see how it progresses in another month. Only side effects are gas, and touches of stomach digestive feelings. So far so good"
