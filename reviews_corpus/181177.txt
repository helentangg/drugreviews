"Took Paxil for the past 5 years for anxiety/depression/panic. Stopped it 1 year ago to pursue pregnancy. I did well for the 1st 6-8 mos but then began to fall apart. Anxiety, panic attacks, depression all returned. I was put on Prozac because it&#039;s pregnancy friendly about 1 week ago. I&#039;ve had the worst reflux/heartburn I&#039;ve ever had in my life. I take the pill at night because it made me sleepy the 1st day when I took it in the morning. I&#039;m currently on day 8, the reflux is slightly better but I have increased anxiety/panic. I hadn&#039;t had this the 1st week. Does anyone have an similar stories? I appreciate feedback. I&#039;m not sure whether to stick it out on Prozac or switch to a different med."
