"I have been on Cymbalta for about 6 months. In this time I lost my libido completely, suffered night sweats and couldn&#039;t work out if I was hot or cold during the day. I constantly felt sick both in my head and my stomach and suffered a general loss of energy, probably due to the crazy dreams and loss of sleep. I decided to quit Cymbalta cold turkey, and suffered major brain zaps and a general feeling of unwellness. The worst thing was, I didn&#039;t realise this is why I felt so sick and it was impossible to find a doctor who would take my symptoms seriously. None of them knew anything about the drug either. I had to work it out for myself. I&#039;ve lost several months trying to work out why I always feel sick."
