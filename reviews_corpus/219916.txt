"I started the medication after suffering from insomnia and general anxiety. I tried citrolpram and basically didn&#039;t sleep for a month along with numerous other side affects. I was sceptical the first couple of times I took 10mg to help with sleep and it had no effect, maybe I needed to wait longer for the citrolpram to clear out my system. I left it couple of days and tried 25 mg, let&#039;s just say I slept the best I had in a long time. I haven&#039;t really noticed any other side affects, maybe this is because citrolopram made me feel so strange this doesn&#039;t even scratch the surface. Anyway I&#039;m now to look forward to bed and I hope this continues as it is really helping me focus better at work having more sleep."
