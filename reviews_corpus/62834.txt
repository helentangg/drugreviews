"I love this medication. I had gone through a very stressful period and was a basket case. I like benzodiazepines but their addictive quality makes them hard to get and hard to get off of. My doctor put me on 20mgs of citalopram and it didn&#039;t help that much. Then, she put me on 40mgs. It took 3 weeks but it started to work. No side effect."
