"It obviously affects everyone differently. I&#039;ve been taking Fluoxetine for about 10 years 20mg per day.  Yes it has some side effects which are difficult to anticipate and manage, it can make me overly excited, and at times a little euphoric, which arrives quickly making it difficult to contain. On the other side I suffered from manic depression and I used to happily go into a black hole in a blind rage, and the medication just stopped that completely so I feel like it&#039;s a very positive trade off.  I do get very sleepy, and tired so honestly I just sleep more? I tried reducing my dosage a couple of times over the years I&#039;ve been taking this but could not handle the withdrawal."
