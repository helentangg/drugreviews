"This medication helped me with panic attacks but my anxiety was still pretty prevalent even at 150mg a day.  In addition, it caused uncomfortable side effects of excessive sweaty, especially at night which would wake me although I used to be a person who could sleep through a thunderstorm.  I also began having severe gastrointestinal problems which lasted for months before I switched to a different medication.  We&#039;ll see how it goes."
