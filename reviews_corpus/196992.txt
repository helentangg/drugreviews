"I was diagnosed with severe clinical depression and anxiety. I was placed on Paroxetine and have been on them between 20 and 30mg for the last 6 or so years. Along with others here I found it to help out heaps after a period of months, you could not measure the change from this week to last week but rather this month compared to 3 months ago and there was a noticeable positive difference in my mind. The last 6 or so months however I feel like I&#039;ve plateaued and don&#039;t feel as they they are helping me with my inner struggles as much anymore. Definitely saved my life though as I was in a bad bad way. A bit of weight gain but if that&#039;s the price for getting better I can handle that :)"
