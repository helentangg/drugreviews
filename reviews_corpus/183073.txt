"I was in a clinical trial for fibromyalgia with Cymbalta.  It helped tremendously, I was in a double blind study but could definitely tell the difference in being on a minimal dose and therapeutic dose. This was in 2008 and I have taken it since with great success in improving (not eliminating) the aches and pain. Now my doctor wants to wean me off and I don&#039;t want to be off of it."
