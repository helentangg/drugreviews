"Celexa is a literally a magic pill, for me. 20 minutes, tops &amp; I feel like myself again. I&#039;ve been taking it for about 4 years for 1 or 2 months a couple of times a year. The holidays are always bad. I get so sick of crying all the time. Sobbing, actually. I&#039;ve tried a few other antidepressants but nothing works like Celexa. For me. May not be for everyone. Other people may need to take Celexa for a longer or more regular period of time &amp; it can take up to 2-3 weeks for the medication to completely work, for a lot of people. Ask your doctor &amp; give it a try."
