"I am over 70 after a lifetime of coping with  PTSD following severe childhood trauma.  I was past 40 before finally having a diagnosis,  None of the medicines I tried in therapy were truly effective so I was resigned to a limited life attempting to control symptoms of anxiety and of course, depression.  After three months of taking this medication, I am still astounded by the sense of quiet at the center of me.  When I need to go out (to the store, or to walk my dog) I just go, with no strategizing over how to avoid people.  I want to post this for other people with chronic PTSD.  Try this.  It may work for you too.  Life is peaceful and much easier now."
