"I have been taking citalopram for 2 months now, it started to work with me almost immediately. I think in hind sight I had been depressed for years, but was always very cynical of taking antidepressants, having put on a brave face to the world for so many years, then my brother committed suicide last year and I finally broke. I stopped going out, making excuses to not see people, cried constantly and couldn&#039;t handle anything even minutely stressful. Spent most days in bed not seeing anyone, my doctor put me onto 20mgs and the difference in me has been life changing, I had no side effects whatsoever and I&#039;m so happy and able to cope again. Also like somebody else on here mentioned, I like the fact that I&#039;m not completely void of emotion."
