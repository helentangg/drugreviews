"WORST DRUG EVER! Side effects  were body shocks, headaches, worse anxiety, etc. I only took it for three weeks and it caused me to feel numb mentally and emotionally. Drove me nuts! So I went off it and let me tell you... WORST withdrawals ever! Lethargy,  bad thoughts, apathy, brain zaps, mood swings, depression, etc. Before you take it, which I DON&#039;T recommend as there are other options, read stories about the withdrawals. Theres so many lawsuits against it. Oh and it induced a mania in me and now I&#039;m stuck on antipsychotics..."
