"I feel like some of you people commenting on how inept the doctors are at prescribing medication for you fail to realize how medications affect people differently. You had a bad experience? That is in no way, shape or form the doctors fault. At all. Your body chemistry is just different than they expected. These psychiatric issues are not an exact science. Medicine is not an exact science. 
That aside, I&#039;ve only been on Cymbalta for about a month but I have already noticed a vast improvement. I feel less anxious overall and haven&#039;t experienced a panic attack since I started on it. Again this isn&#039;t an exact science and sometimes it takes experimentation to get the right combination. Hopefully I&#039;ve found a proper solution to my issues."
