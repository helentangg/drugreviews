"I don&#039;t know what &quot;feeling like myself again&quot; would even feel like..so in contrast to other users I can&#039;t speak on that note. I do feel &quot;better&quot; since starting Brint. My suicidal thoughts have gone away. Of course I still feel hopeless and down at times. My anxiety seems to be much better. I have side effects of redding of my cheeks, weight gain despite eating less. I think I will stop it soon if the weight gain continues."
