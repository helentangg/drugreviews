"Thanks to all people who write comments. I have been givin 25mg of sertraline and wasn&#039;t sure that I wanted to take it. I&#039;ve been feeling in the dumps for 7 months now due to stress at work and other events. I question everybody&#039;s motives. I cry and feel sad a lot. I don&#039;t want to get up in the morning and bed is my only refuge. I feel like I don&#039;t even want or care to get better.  I will take it as prescribed (I think) and give it a chance."
