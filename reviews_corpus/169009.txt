"I have been diagnosed with depression.  The only other anti-depressant I have been on is Zoloft.  I felt that Zoloft did absolutely nothing for me.  I was at my wits end with being depressed, so my Therapist suggested Viibryd.  She said a lot of her patients have had great success with it.  She gave me a sample pack to try.  I have been taking the 10 mg dose and I have to say, within hours, I felt a calm that I hadn&#039;t felt in a long time.  The negativity voices in my head were switched off. I related better with people and was much less self conscious.  About four hours after I took it, I did feel very sick, and almost stoned.  It took a few hours to get over it, but once I leveled out, (About 10 hours after I took it) I FELT AMAZING."
