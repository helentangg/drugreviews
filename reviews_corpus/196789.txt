"I previously posted on here in December 2016 when I first started taking them for Depression, Anxiety, Trichtillomania . I was on 30mg of paroxetine until now, I&#039;ve had to come off them. I&#039;ve been a complete zombie for 6 months, I slept 12 hours a night, had no interest in doing anything, exercise was impossible. Headaches, snacking, lack of concentration. It was like I still had anxiety just the symptoms were numbed. Since stopping taking this medicine I feel alive. I am still sick but I am able to get up and go to the gym and I only need 8 hours or less sleep. I came off cold turkey, it was very stupid but I needed relief from this med. I&#039;m feeling much more alive. I think I&#039;ll need meds again but I won&#039;t be using paroxetine (or sertraline or citalopram!)"
