"Most notable change is my appetite.  I&#039;ve been athletic my whole life, but gained 40 pounds in one year of from compulsive binge eating.  I thought I was just being a pig, which perpetuated the horrible cycle of depression and anxiety.  Turns out I was just really, really low on seratonin.  The cravings / irrational food addiction went completely away at around 75mgs.  Now I have to make an effort to eat enough to fuel an active lifestyle.  Stress and anxiety and depression subsided gradually.  They&#039;re not completely gone, but they&#039;re manageable now.  Combined with a healthy life style and some intense therapy, I&#039;m able to overcome bouts of anxiety and depression, and those bouts are shorter and less severe.  A tool, not a magic pill."
