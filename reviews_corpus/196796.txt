"I am a long time (near 25 years) Paxil user. Some of your new users need to give it a chance before making an assessment. I had some of those side effects early on-they were no big deal and they all went away over time. Bottom line, I suffered from lifelong severe depression-Paxil literally stopped me from taking my own life. On Anxiety, the result has not been as positive, but perhaps I need to increase my dosage? I&#039;ll talk to my physician on that. If you&#039;re mainly depressed I heartily endorse Paxil, it reduces depression with minimal side effects. It&#039;s a wonder drug in my book!"
