"I have been on medication for about 4 weeks. Anti-depressants have always been my best friend. This drug has been remarkable thus far. No major side effects physically. The main problem I am dealing with are dreams but mostly nightmares. I take my medication usually before lunch. I missed it one day and took it before bed time, never again. I was awake most of the night. I am successfully weaning off of xanax &amp; THC during this period with great success. No thoughts of suicide. Life seems better. I&#039;m in my late 40&#039;s and a full-time student. I would totally recommend this medication because this is the first time in life that I feel more myself. Hey, I can even crack a smile....something I haven&#039;t done in years."
