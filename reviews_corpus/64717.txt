"Initially I took pills late in the night.  My side effects were tummy rumbling and gas, it was hard to get up from bed in the morning, I woke up during the night sometimes shaky and suicidal thoughts, anxiety  with compulsive body movement.  Although you do not really know whether you would have experience this or more without the medicine anyway. Tried to change to take pill in the morning but did not work out well for me. Back to pill in the evening and now life is better and more predictable.  I noticed mornings were bad but improved as day progressed so slowly shifted time to early, first 8PM, 7PM, etc, until I moved the worst part to night and I find easier to get up and start the day."
