"I have been taking fluoxetine for 3 months. I&#039;d been suffering from stress and anxiety which caused depression. It took 2-3 weeks until I noticed the benefit, luckily I didn&#039;t have any side effects (other than weight loss, bonus!). Now I feel like I always did before life started wearing me down, friends and family have noticed. I&#039;m happy and it feels natural I thought that taking tablets would make me appear like and feel like I was on medication. Far from it I feel like myself.
I have since found out that my cousin and my mum had both been prescribed it in the past and both had discontinued after a week as they suffered from night tremors. I would not have taken it if I had known this. However I am so glad I have."
