"I was on Paxil for a month.  I noticed a significant difference the first two weeks and then went back to my usual, on edge self, after that.  Now, I&#039;m trying Celexa.  I know I need to take something. I&#039;m just not sure which one it is. My doctor brought up Viibryd at my doctor&#039;s visit. "
