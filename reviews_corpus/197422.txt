"I&#039;ve been experiencing panic attacks for over a year, at first I thought maybe it was a phase that would pass but they have become constant and are really affecting my life. My doctor prescribed 10mg dosage for the first 2 weeks then 20mg from then on and I take them before bed. I been on it for a week and 3days and experiencing headaches and when I wake up to fast I feel like the room is moving and I can&#039;t focus my vision. Hopefully the side effects go away and I can experience the benefits. I&#039;ve been reading lots of different opinions, mostly about the withdrawal symptoms. I&#039;m 18 so I don&#039;t want to be hooked on it forever then again if it helps my panic disorder and doesn&#039;t cause any major health issues, why not?"
