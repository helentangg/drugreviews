"I took 10 mg for a few days but became very uncomfortably manic.  So I started to cut the pill and it ends up that I am taking 20 mg over 3 days. 
This is the end of the 6th week. I have had chronic clinical depression for 27 years.  I am taking this with 225 mg of Buproprion a day and 50 mg of
Fluvoximine.  I experience no improvement and have had more thoughts of suicide in a long time.  I see the doc in two weeks.  If it is not noticeable by that time, 8 weeks, out it goes."
