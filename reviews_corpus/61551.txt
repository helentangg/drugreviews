"I&#039;ve been taking citalopram for 6 years, I come off it when I occasionally go backpacking for a few months. The last time I did this, after about 5 weeks started to feel very depressed. I cut my travels short due to severe anxiety and an inability to connect - I felt so low and not in control of my dark thoughts. I cried often and felt very lost, had terrible insomnia also.

I have had some traumatic experiences in life and I&#039;ve now started therapy for this and I realise this is probably where my issues come from, however citalopram allows me to function, my mood becomes more stable and my thoughts far more rational. every time I come off it, I eventually become highly anxious and depressed and sucked into a hole. 
started back on it today!"
