"Lexapro was the first medication for what was first diagnosed as adjustment disorder and later major depressive disorder. Lexapro (escatalopram) had me relaxed within a couple of days. I was so chilled. Any more relaxed and you&#039;d think I was asleep. I have a highly stressed involved workplace where I lead teams of people and I was able to get my patience, communicative persona, positive outlook and collaborative nature back on track. My home life improved immensely. I was able to regain my perspective on the importance of issues meaning I could let small things go. The most important thing is I felt better in myself. I was so happy until two years down the track. Unfortunately it stopped working."
