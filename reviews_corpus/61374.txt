"I have been suffering from PMDD for years. During the week before my period, during my period and the 2 days prior to ovulation. It&#039;s taken years to get this bad though. I have never got very far with doctors. I was offered hormonal contraception repeatedly and always refused, as I was frightened that it would be enough to tip me over the edge. 
I got to a point where I just couldn&#039;t cope with it anymore, and so I spoke to a different doctor, a female doctor who knew me well. I started the usual speech, I even had everything written down, and she stopped me halfway. She knew exactly what to do. 
So, I am now on half cycle 10mg citalopram. I take it when I need to (2 weeks a month). For the first time in years, I feel normal."
