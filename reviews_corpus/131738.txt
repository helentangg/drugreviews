"I&#039;ve been on medication since 18 yrs old and this is by far the best than I&#039;ve taken.
And it really works!! The side effects are unconfortable however in the beginning. But once they are gome I feeled good. I&#039;ve started with 75mg was not enough. Once I was on 150mg the magic operates.And now I have been on 225mg for about 6 months. So far so good. I recommend it.
Best thing that happened to me in a while."
