"Lifted me out of a mood of despair.  Most importantly, it was the best anger management I ever found.  Clear headed, no anxiety, no side affects other than mild nausea, and that ONLY if I take it on an empty stomach.  Don&#039;t miss a dose though, it will make you REALLY woozy.  Stopped for a few months, fell into depression, but Pristiq pulled me right back up when I started back.  Remember that the Rx says specifically that you may need 4 weeks to notice an improvement.  Bear that in mind when you read all these reviews by people who quit taking it after 1 or 2 days."
