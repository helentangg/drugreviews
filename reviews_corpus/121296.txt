"venlafaxine is a HORRIBLE drug. I have put three stone on in the few months I was on it, despite being active!I asked to be put in an antidepressant that didn&#039;t have that side effect so this has made me feel even worse. You mustcbe good at remembering the exact time to take this or withdrawals kick in within a few hours!tapered down over the space of one month to the smallest 37.5 dose, I am on day 7 of no ven and it&#039;s been the week from hell!hearing voices,vertigo, nausea,vomiting,crying for hours, mania,severe anger, crazy thoughts, head zaps (the weirdest sensation) confusion,memory loss,sweating, took me a week to feel even slightly human and still feel crap!taking diazepam to calm symptoms,terrified it has caused irreparable damage."
