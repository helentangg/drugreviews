"I have been on Pristiq for four weeks and as others have noted, I have lost weight (20 lbs.) and have feel much better about myself both mentally and physically. I have experienced some unpleasant side effects that could possibly be the Pristiq but could also be caused from a new pain medication I have been trying. Maybe the doctor can decide next week after my checkup."
