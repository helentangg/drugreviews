"I was prescribed Celexa for my severe anxiety and depression. I was very doubtful of it because my main problem was my anxiety and I was told this was an antidepressant, but I decided to give it a try. I read about every review on this site, and I was scared to death since everyone got side effects. I even cried before I took it. I&#039;ve been on it for a few days now. From day 1, no side effects. My anxiety has also slightly decreased already. I find that I am able to realize I&#039;m feeling anxious and simply think &quot;I don&#039;t care&quot; and it instantly goes away. Please don&#039;t be scared off by the side effects. I have finally found relief in my life and can&#039;t wait for the next few weeks when it works even better."
