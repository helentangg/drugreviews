"It really works wonders. I&#039;ve been on it for almost a week and I&#039;m just so calm and chilled. My anxiety started getting really, really bad. To the point where I&#039;d cry over nothing almost. I&#039;d sit and stress over the most trivial matters, but in my mind they were huge and irreparable. I&#039;d stopped eating, it freak out on my own etc. Being social became a huge issue and rationalizing that everything would be okay didn&#039;t work anymore. Eventually I bit the bullet and saw a Dr and since then this medicine has really been an absolute blessing."
