"I developed anxiety over a couple months and would eventually not leave my house or my bedroom.  I was not sleeping and could not eat either.  OB did blood tests and told me I was premenopausal and prescribed Zoloft.  It has been a miracle for me.  I have experienced no side effects whatsoever and have been taking it for a year.   Did not want to have to rely on meds but I don&#039;t know how I would be without it."
