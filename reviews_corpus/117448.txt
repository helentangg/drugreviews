"I posted about 2 months ago when I first started taking Nortriptyline, 25mg, once a day.  I had a continuous headache day in and out.  After taking multiple drugs, Imitrex, Prodrin, Midrin, not much relief.  After about 2 weeks on Nortriptyline my continuous headache had diminished, &quot;almost&quot; entirely.  I did notice though many afternoons my headache return and I had to take other meds to help reduce the discomfort.  I talked to my doctor and he agreed maybe 2x a day would be best.  25mg in the morning and again at night.  That was about 3 weeks ago and now, very rarely do I have any headaches, at any time of day.  I hope this continues.  What a relief.  To me, this has been a true wonder drug for my 24 hour headache!  No side effects."
