"I have taken Effexor on and off for nearly ten years for depression and anxiety brought on by a sudden traumatic situation.  It took a week or so for the side effects to disappear when I first started.  I felt so well that I weaned myself off it which took at least a week with side effects.  I have done this twice thinking I was very well and able to cope which I do when I take the medication.  However, I have come to realize that I need to stay on it and my husband now understands that it keeps me well, happy and balanced.  If I miss a tablet I feel quite nauseous and a bit unbalanced even though I only take 75mg once a day.  I have come to realize that there a lot of people out there, including many high profile people who need Effexor."
