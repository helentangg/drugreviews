"I was taking Cymbalta, and all of a sudden it quit working. My Docs office had samples so I starting taking the brintellix. After my first week I went back to the doctor and told them I didn&#039;t feel any change, so she bumped me up to 20mg. I now feel so calm and my mood is better, and I am more sociable. This is a excellent medication."
