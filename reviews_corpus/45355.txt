"This medicine was actually doing some good. My doctor started me off at 10mg since I don&#039;t respond well to antidepressants (such as Paxil, Effexor). At first I started actually having the suicidal thoughts they warned me about for the first week. Eventually after 3 weeks I started to notice a difference in my panic attacks. They were weaker but still bothersome. My depression was also getting better but around 2 months of taking it. I still had the crying spells. I told my doctor and he bumped me up to 20 mg. Slowly I really started to notice a bigger improvement. It&#039;s been almost 3 months and my panic attacks are very weak as I am able to control them! My crying spells aren&#039;t as bad but I still get them. (Not as often which is great!)"
