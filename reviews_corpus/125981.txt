"I was one if the unlucky ones, and experienced a ton of negative side effects from Viibriyd: sleep paralysis, falls, insomnia, increased anxiety/panic, loss of concentration, a carnival of digestive effects, dizziness, loss of appetite, forgetfulness, etc. Each increase in dosage made the side effects worse.

If I&#039;d had a fraction of my usual judgment I would have asked to be taken off of it after the first week.

I&#039;m currently tapering off, and for me, the withdrawal symptoms are totally preferable to the side effects.

Viibryd is great for a lot of people, and that&#039;s awesome. If it is making you feel worse than when you started, stay in close contact with your doctor and do not hesitate to question whether you should stay on it."
