"I am 24 years old and have a 14 week old son. I have fought with depression most of my life due to childhood and what not. After having my son everything came crashing down. I was on the brink of a divorce and suicidal. So I ask my Dr, he put me on 50mg of Zoloft and I&#039;m now on day 4. Side effects for me are headache, tired, dizzy nausea. But I&#039;m sticking to it hoping those will go away. My mood is so much better."
