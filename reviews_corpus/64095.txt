"I&#039;m gonna start with saying do not read all the negative reviews! I was iffy about taking this and read the reviews, huge mistake... I had anxiety about taking the anxiety medicine. I waited a few days before taking it and after speaking to a few people who have been on it and a friend of mine who is a pharmacist, I decided I would try it! I am so surprised at how different everything is, so different I can&#039;t believe this is normal for people. I often catch myself thinking about how clear my mind is and I&#039;m not freaking out about car accidents, fires, natural disasters or death. I&#039;m not living in fear or anything, although it has only been a few days I can definitely tell a difference the only side effect so far is cotton mouth. Good luck:)"
