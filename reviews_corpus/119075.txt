"I have been on Zoloft for 3 years and I have no idea how I did anything before without it. After I had my 2nd daughter, I did not want to be around anyone but her. That included my 1st daughter and my husband. I felt terrible for feeling that way but it would not go away until I started taking Zoloft. After that I was feeling great. It also helped with my OCD. I can not take the generic version because I get really dizzy just like I do with the regular Zoloft if a miss a dose. I just have to make sure that it does not happen."
