"I was on Zoloft for 8 years and the side effects became unbearable and it wasn&#039;t working for me anymore.  My doctor switched me to Lexapro.  Its hard to say whether my side effects initially were caused by the withdrawal from the Zoloft or the Lexapro.  After a few days I felt like myself again.  I didn&#039;t have trouble sleeping, but I gained 10 lbs every 6 months.  I have had a lot of stress in my life and the Lexapro wasn&#039;t enough for me and had to take Xanax on occasions.  Lexapro does not treat PMS mood swings so I usually took the Xanax around my period.  It helped, but the weight gain was depressing and no matter what I did I was hungry all the time and couldn&#039;t lose the weight.  "
