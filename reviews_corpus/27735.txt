"I struggled with severe postpartum anxiety and depression for two years after my daughter was born. I went to therapy but was still struggling. I didn&#039;t want to take medication for a very long time, because I just didn&#039;t want to be a &quot;medicated mom.&quot; I always thought it would get better. It didn&#039;t and I was exhausted. I am taking only 10mg of lexapro now (therapeutic dose is considered 20mg) and I&#039;m staying at 10. My life is COMPLETELY different. I feel joy and happiness again, my anxiety is gone, I sleep well, my sadness and anger are gone. It is life changing and I can&#039;t believe I didn&#039;t do it sooner. And I&#039;m actually a better, happier mom now! Give yourself a chance to get better. Mild side effects at first - mild nausea and headache."
