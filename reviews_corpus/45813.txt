"I&#039;ve been on Prozac for about 4-5 months. My doctor started me on the lowest dosage (10mg) and we had to increase it. Currently, I&#039;ve been on 40mg/day for about 5 weeks or so. It seems to be helping me with my OCD somewhat. I&#039;ve noticed that I haven&#039;t been quite as bad as I used to be, but I&#039;m also seeing a counselor, which is helping as well. I&#039;ve heard that for OCD, you may need to go as high as 60-80mg for people with OCD. We may change my dosage in the future."
