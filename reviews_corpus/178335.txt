"I have been on Cymbalta 30mg for the last 5 days. I noticed a lot of side effects good and bad. The bad ones include insomnia, dizziness, nausea, and dry mouth. The two good side effect was less urgency to urinate and fewer hunger pangs. I used to run to the bathroom every hour and almost constantly eat. My mood is improving and I seem to be coming out of my shell. In a few more days my dose will double and I am sure this medication will work. I feel as if I am on the right path to becoming who I used to be years ago."
