"I started taking citalopram for 12 days. At first they started me with 10 mg but that didn&#039;t affect me at all so I went back to the doctor and they gave me 20 mg. I started to notice that my anxiety was getting worst which was the main reason why I started taking the pill and I also had some stress but I also notice that the hours between 2 to 10 pm my anxiety goes away for some reason. Yesterday was the first night in 2 weeks where I slept the whole night without a nervous feeling and today which is day 12 my anxiety through out the day hasn&#039;t really affected me. I actually woke up in the morning without the feeling of going to the hospital....hopefully every day gets better."
