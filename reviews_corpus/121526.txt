"Started at 75 then gradually increased to 300 mg over the course of about a year. Has worked so well for me. 300 mg is optimal for me. If I drop below that my symptoms return within a few days. It has horrible withdrawal effects though. Nausea, headache, dizziness, weakness. It&#039;s worth it to me though. I can think clearly, focus on work, not irritated , not depressed or having horrible thoughts on repeat all day. Have not had thoughts of harming myself since I&#039;ve been on it. Also I have social anxiety. Now I can go places without fear and heart pounding. I&#039;ve tried paxil, and wellbutrin, but this is it for me. Hope this helped."
