"I started taking 10mg daily about 2 years ago.  It has made me less stressed on a daily basis and has decreased any anxiety I had about the little things in life.  I used to be paranoid about a lot of minor things and that paranoia has gone away almost completely.  My moods were &quot;down &quot; at least 2 weeks out of 4 in my cycle.  I thought this would help me feel more upbeat, along with eliminating the anxiety.  At first I felt tired but after a couple of months, but after 2 months I was back to my normal self.  I recommend this medicine to anyone who feels daily anxiety and stress and long-lasting (2 weeks at a time) mood swings."
