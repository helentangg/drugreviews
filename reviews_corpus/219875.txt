"Been taking it for 6 years initially for depression then anxiety and stress and it&#039;s one of the worst things to happen to me. Constant eczema where my skins gets very itchy and sore that I have scars all over, constipation is probably the worst as I&#039;ve had periods of vomiting to stomach being sore and bloated, blurred vision, it&#039;s addictive contrary to what doctors say as I have been trying to get off it for 2 years slowly and been admitted to hospital twice in that time for substance abuse relating to endep. Doctors can&#039;t understand why I have been on it for so long. Take mine at night as you get drowsy of a day on higher than 50mg (most I taken was 75mg) now on 10mg and still get constipation."
