"This drug has ruined my life.

I was prescribed this drug 3 months ago. I had severe side effects with more intense feeling of anxiety, extreme lack of appetite (ate only small snacks of for 3 days) and problems with erectile dysfunction. After taking it for 6 days I consulted with a pharmacist and decided to get off the medication. And did so by reducing it&#039;s dosage in a span of 2 days.

It&#039;s been almost 3 months since I&#039;ve taken it. And I still have Erectile Dysfunction, which is depressing. Now I&#039;m seeking treatment for it... I hate the thought of having to rely on ED medication for the rest of my life because of what this drug has done to me. But I feel that might be the case now."
