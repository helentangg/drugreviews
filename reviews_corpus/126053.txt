"I have been on Viibryd for 3 months.  My mood has improved a lot. I have decided to try something else, though, because of the weight gain and acne.  Also, I have had debilitating pain in all my joints.  The doctors say it wouldn&#039;t be the meds causing it; they should be helping if anything, but I figured I should mention it in case others have had a similar experience.  I will say, that I would be willing to go back on it, if the side effects don&#039;t improve with different meds."
