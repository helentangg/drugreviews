"I was prescribed 10 mg once a day for depression and anxiety. After 3 months, I did notice a change in my mood. I would say it took about 3 weeks for me to notice a difference. I wasn&#039;t as anxious, less panic attacks and I wasn&#039;t as &quot;down in the dumps&quot;. However, for me the side effects nulled the good. My sex drive decreased a good bit which caused problems in my relationship. I also experienced increased headaches, brain &quot;zaps&quot; and I was ALWAYS tired. I would yawn all day long LITERALLY. Being a full time college student, this was not good. I was too tired to enjoy life. All I wanted to do was sleep. I am now on Prozac."
