"After suffering for some time with PMT I decided I couldn&#039;t continue the way I was as it was interfering with my personal life aswel as my work life. I spoke to my GP who offered me some different options, Prozac being one of them. At that point I felt I couldn&#039;t carry on the way I was so gave Prozac a try. I&#039;ve been on it for around 6 weeks now and already feel &#039;normal&#039; again. I don&#039;t feel anxious or hate myself. It seems to have cleared my thoughts. It&#039;s still early but it&#039;s definatly helped me get back to my old self."
