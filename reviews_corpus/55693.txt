"Started Effexor after other anti-depressants gave me too many side effects. I&#039;m four months in now and so far it has been great. I do have times where I&#039;m very sleepy, have vivid dreams, and some weight gain but those are minor to me compared to how miserable I was before. Sexually it&#039;s been helpful as I&#039;m not on edge all the time and can relax easier.  It&#039;s up to the individual to decide what side effects are deal breakers. I have accidentally missed a dose here and there but haven&#039;t experienced any of the withdrawals that others have."
