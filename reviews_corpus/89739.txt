"Starting taking Celexa 11/08 started with 20mg and a few months later the dose is 60mg.  I was extremely tired the first week or so, and then again with every increased dose.  Overall, the drug works.  The down and out feeling is gone.  I&#039;m more laid back than usual, but I don&#039;t feel like a Zombie.  My side effects are sweating and no desire for food, both I have learned to live with.  I stopped taking the medication on my own, and suffered with the worst headaches ever.  I quickly refilled my prescription and things are back to normal."
