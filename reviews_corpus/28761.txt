"I had anxiety and extremely debilitating depression. I started with 5 mg of Lexapro for 1.5 weeks and upped the dose to 10 for about three weeks. At first I didn&#039;t notice that much difference, even had the depression get worse for a few days after upping to 10 mg. THEN I started taking 15 mg and after 1 day I already felt so much better! And now, 2 weeks later I can say I almost feel like the old me!
I am tremendously grateful for this medicine."
