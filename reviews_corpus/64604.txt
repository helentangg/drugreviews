"I&#039;ve had severe depression for 6 years, and just now began to take medications.  I began at 50 mg, which was quickly bumped up to 100 mg only 2 weeks later due to no effects.  Two weeks later, I was bumped up again to 150 mg.  I have yet to notice any positive effects, but my parents say that I have been more pleasant to live with.
