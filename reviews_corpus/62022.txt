"Been taking celexa for 6 years now. I used to have such severe panic attacks I was afraid to live on my own, go grocery shopping, social gatherings, daily activities, etc.  I would constantly be in emergency thinking I was having a heart attack. It took a few months for me to feel the effect. My panic attacks are so rare to none now. It also helped with my mild depression. Only bad side effect is I lack energy and am very tired. Celexa has changed my life, I&#039;m so thankful for this medication."
