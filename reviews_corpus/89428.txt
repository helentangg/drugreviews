"I started taking Celexa because I told my doctor my mood swings were crazy. It was depression. Well it helped big time! I&#039;ve been on it for over a year 10mg but sometimes I take 20mg. I am starting to feel more sad now though but its my living situation that is making me sad. Celexa is a great medicine although I never thought I would take anti-depressants. Anyhow I was super skinny, it helped me gain weight and keep it on. So yes you will gain weight on it but other then that it has worked for me until now. Now I don&#039;t feel happy but I did when I started taking it."
