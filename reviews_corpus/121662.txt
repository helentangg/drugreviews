"Have been on a lot of different antidepressants for anxiety. Most meds made my condition worse (making me more hyper) or made me &#039;not care&#039; (eg citalopram). Although it&#039;s been hard getting used to Effexor - it made me very sick for the first few weeks and affected my sleep - I now feel more in control now than I&#039;ve ever been before."
