"I&#039;ve been taking Cymbalta (60mg) for around 6 months now and it seems to be really helping me with my anxiety and depression. I don&#039;t panic over little things anymore which is great and my friends and family have really seen an improvement in my mood. Decreased my appetite and emotional eating and I&#039;ve lost 17 kilos (37 pounds).

Negative (but bearable) side effects would be moderate fatigue, the occasional headache if I take my dose late, weird dreams every night, twitching, dizziness when I stand up. The worst thing I&#039;ve noticed is memory problems, I sometimes can&#039;t remember simple words and get a little confused."
