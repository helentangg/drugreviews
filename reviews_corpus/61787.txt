"Been experiencing very bad anxiety, panic attacks, agoraphobia, etc &amp; my doctor out me 10mg of citalopram. No side effects the first week besides being drowsy &amp; cloudy minded. My doctor just doubled the dose to 20mg &amp; the 3 days on that so far have been awful. I&#039;m really nauseous all day, still having panic attacks &amp; anxiety. I feel unmotivated &amp; lethargic. I&#039;m going to try to take it at night, if the side effect don&#039;t ease up I&#039;m going to stop taking this medication."
