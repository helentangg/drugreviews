"Took this for nerve pain and it helped! Except I would rather ache &amp; have nerve pain than deal with the side effects I experienced. I kept getting nightmares that were so horrific, I eventually started sleeping with the lights on &amp; thus not sleeping as good. Within 6 months I gained 20 lbs without changing my eating habits nor physical activity. Looking back, there was a short period of time when my vision was affected as I had trouble focusing. At the time, I just thought my contacts prescription was getting too strong for me. I decided to revisit the list of side effects and sure enough there they all were. I quit taking Nortriptyline that day and eventually the nightmares, blurred vision, &amp; weight gain went away."
