"I was diagnosed with bipolar/severe mania and depression since I was 26, I have see every psychiatrist in my area, and have been put on every antidepressant from Paxil to Effexor. The only one that ever worked is Nardil. I am 33 years old now and would recommend this monoamine oxidase inhibitor to everyone who needs to be on an antidepressant.  I was fortunate to find a very  intelligent doctor who worked with me through these years.  He told me not too many doctors prescribe Nardil for the food restrictions or whatever, but I personally believe the &quot;old school&quot; MAOI&#039;s are the way to go. Nardil gets a 10 in my book.  I felt the ahhh, effects after one week."
