"This medication changed my life! I was depressed overcome with fatigue and generally unpleasant to be around! After the first two weeks of fatigue passes I am back to the old Laurie &quot;the nice to be around Laurie&quot; also noticed a decrease in appetite...which is super for me being slightly overweight! Although it&#039;s expensive I am blessed to have insurance and only paid 20$ for the name brand...I wish all who suffer with Peri Menopausal symptoms and or depression would give this medication a try!"
