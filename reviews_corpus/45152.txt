"I was on Flouxitine for years and felt numb, so I switched to another medication which was a huge mistake. I&#039;m back on Flouxitine and it saved my life, I can go places again, I&#039;m loosing weight that the other medicine caused, and I have so much energy. I have depression, anxiety, and agoraphobia. Flouxitine is what makes me a person again, and without it I don&#039;t know if I would be alive. I did have stomach bug symptoms in the beginning but it went away and I feel great."
