"I have been taking 20 mg for about 33 days now and I have noticed a huge difference in my OCD. I am able to get thoughts out of my head very easily! I have been able to watch a movie without rewinding it 20 times.I am able to clean and leave a little spot that I missed.I am able to not replay situations over and over in my head. It is great!"
