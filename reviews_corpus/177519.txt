"I read a lot of reviews before taking this and there seemed to be really mixed views. I&#039;ve tried Citalopram, mirtazapine and now this. This is the first time I&#039;ve not felt like a complete zombie detached from life. This drug has pretty much saved my life and bought control back to my life. The only long term side effect I&#039;ve experience is heart palpitations. The nausea lasted a week tops. Everybody is different and responds differently to medications. So don&#039;t be put off by negative comments"
