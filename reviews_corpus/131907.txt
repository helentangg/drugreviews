"I HAD BEEN ON SEVERAL DIFFERENT MEDS FOR DEPRESSION &amp; ANXIETY.  STARTING WITH PAXIL, PROZAC AND OTHERS I CAN&#039;T REMEMBER THE NAMES OF. I STARTED EFFEXOR A YEAR AGO AND IT CERTAINLY WORKS FOR ME, FOR BOTH DEPRESSION &amp; ANXIETY.  REMEMBER TO TAKE IT EVERYDAY. ALL SSRIs CAUSE SEVERE WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS. IF YOU WANT TO DISCONTINUE USE, TELL YOUR DR.  COLD TURKEY IS NOT ONLY DEBILITATING IT IS DANGEROUS. I AM SO THANKFUL I HAVE BEEN PRESCRIBED EFFEXOR. FINALLY RELIEF FROM THINGS THAT ARE NO BIG DEAL! WHERE AS BEFORE IN MY HEAD, IT WAS SO EXAGGERATED. I LIKE MANY OTHERS HAVE STATED, I WISH THIS WAS AVAILABLE IN MY TEEN YEARS. I AM ENJOYING LIFE AND AM EXTREMELY HAPPY!"
