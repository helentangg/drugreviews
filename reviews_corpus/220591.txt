"This is an update to my previous post, about 4 months ago.  Now, through close monitoring and guidance by my doctor, I am taking 40 mg of the amitriptyline around 10am and 20 mg around 10pm.  Side effects at this dosage are insignificant (dry mouth, bitter taste, sometimes sleepy 3 hours after morning dose) considering I am getting much relief from the constant pushing/pulling.  I rated 8 this time because this amount seems the most I can take.  I&#039;m so grateful for having about 15 days and evenings where I can sit normally to watch T.V or read, not having to have to be lying down.  So I encourage any people with transformed migraines to ask your doctor about trying it. I forgot to mention that I can finally get REM sleep now. No more Ambien."
