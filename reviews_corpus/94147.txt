"Am 61 male. Tried all SSRI&#039;s and MAOI&#039;s for persistent depression over 9 years. Most recent was Prozac. None of these worked beyond moderate improvement. Depression and anxiety attended me constantly. I used Lorazepam to sleep effectively. I went on Brintellix 10 mg and within 2 weeks felt stable and able to deal with challenging personal setbacks with clarity and resolve. I think that 4 months into it I have found a drug that truly works."
