"No more migraines since I&#039;ve been taking Elavil. I use only 12.5 mg per day, taken at night. Have tried millions of other medicines. This is the best. First few weeks you will be very tired, it goes away then all will finally be normal with no more head throbbing. Coctail with 10 mg Lexapro. 1 and 1/2 years of no migraines."
