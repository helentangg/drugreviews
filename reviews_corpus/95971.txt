"I was on 150 mg Zoloft for about 2 years. It worked fairly well at combating my Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and depression however, it gave me horrible insomnia/nausea. I probably would&#039;ve given it a seven if it weren&#039;t for the side effects. They&#039;re just something that everyone who takes it should be aware of."
