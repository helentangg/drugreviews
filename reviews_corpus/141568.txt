"I&#039;ve suffered with extreme anxiety and moods swings daily, fatigue and depression and I can tell you two weeks on Lexapro and the difference is like night and day. The anxiety improved about 2 days in and almost all sides are gone on the 8th day. The first week is the worst with tiredness and increased anxiety and moodiness and nausea but the benefits are worth it completely, I can now tolerate stress so much better. Tips: Always take it after breakfast and it prevents nausea. No problem with sleep so far for me."
