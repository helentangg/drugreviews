"I have mixed feelings about viibryd. I&#039;m switching off of it now, after about a year on it. I found that I did help, but seemed to make me more anxious at first. I didn&#039;t have any other side effects.  After being on it for a while, I noticed if I was even a couple hours late on my dose, I would be a complete mess--crying, panicking, just feeling terrible. I&#039;ve never had such a strong reaction to just being late on taking a medication. I&#039;m not even talking about missing a full day.  This is the main reason why I wanted to get off of viibryd. I stayed on it for fear of withdrawal symptoms and my depression and anxiety worsened. Currently taking celexa and today is my first day with no viibyrid."
