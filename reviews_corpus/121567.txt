"I&#039;ve been on this  (75mg ER) for 2 weeks now but with no positive effects. My depression still lingers and I seem to wake up each morning with a lot of anxiety. The anxiety passes about 3 hours after taking my morning dose but it&#039;s still an unpleasant  way to start my day. Maybe I need more time?"
