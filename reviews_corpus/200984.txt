"I was only able to make it 5 days.  I had nervousness from the time I woke up.  Sweaty palms, nausea, anxiety, vivid unpleasant dreams.  At times I would sleep for 12 hours and others maybe 3 hours.  I couldn&#039;t take it anymore.  I can&#039;t imagine dealing with those side effects for weeks.  I stopped and feel so much better.  It has taken about two days to feel better.  Good luck to everybody but that felt like pure poison to me."
