"I have been on citalopram for two years, I started on Vendor but took bad so I switched to citalopram 20&#039;s. I had a few side effects so I went to 10&#039;s. I worked my way up to 30&#039;s pretty ok but I recently got upped to 40&#039;s and 3 weeks in I am dropping to 20&#039;s as I&#039;ve never felt so low, so lonely, so down and I even cried... sick and fuzzy heads, family pointed out I was not myself, horrible feeling, brought about bad morning anxiety which ruined the whole day but I&#039;m now more determined than ever to best this myself, I have been trying and so far it is working, learning to love myself and think positive, it&#039;s all about believing in myself, good luck"
