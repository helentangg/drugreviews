"After many years of working in fast paced and stressful environments putting in 12-16 hour productive days I was involved in a serious car crash. Over a period of time I came to a point where even 6 hour days were difficult. All outside interest disappeared. I blamed myself for being so weak and useless. After about 4 years of that I finally confessed to my Doctor that I was miserable and didn&#039;t know why.
He prescribed Escutalipram 10 Mg. I took it for 3 days and quit. It was a disaster! I was going to give up, but he asked me to try Sertraline.
I took 1/2 a pill, 25 mg, for a week and he then said to take one 50 mg per day because of my body weight.
No can do. However, 25 mg in the morning, 25 mg in the afternoon WORKS! Don&#039;t give up!"
