"I have anxiety and depression. 43yr old white male, healthy. I was hesitant to take any medication but having lived with low&gt;mid level generalized anxiety disorder my whole life, I was tired of it and the ways that anxiety compromised my life and created depression.  Take 10mg.  Took a few weeks for it to work but has made a real positive difference.  It&#039;s like the anxiety gas-pedal which was usually pressed ON has been reduced significantly, but very subtle.  I still feel the full range of emotions. Just the background anxiety &quot;hum&quot; and the bad habits and destructive thinking that anxiety creates has been lessened.  Very few side effects-delayed ejaculation (not a bad thing), vivid dreams (fine with that).  Work in creative field, worried about getting numbed out, but that doesn&#039;t happen."
