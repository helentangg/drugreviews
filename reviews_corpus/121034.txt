"This drug was the worst experience of my life watching my partner take it! He was prescribed it by his GP for cycling moods (later diagnosed with BPL and Rapid cycling Bi Polar). After a week he begun to run away from home, sat in the road in the rain,  ran away from work. (before he had held a job for 9 years despite awful mood swings). GP felt this was &#039;normal&#039; and upped his dose. He then begun to plan his own suicide and was only stopped thanks to a security guard at the car park. He stopped caring about me or anyone else. He then two days later turned psychotic with a knife (we are taking about a gentle animal loving world peace advocate I might add). Stayed in a mental hospital to detox, now on quetrapine, much better. Awful drug!"
