"I&#039;m on Zoloft for many yrs but have tried many other&#039;s  But I don&#039;t think that I&#039;m bipolar. That&#039;s a diagnosis I got 20yrs ago. I&#039;m scheduled to get an updated diagnoses next week.
I have had depression since I was in grade school. I knew it. Through the years I&#039;ve read about symptoms and just recently read an article about how to know what kind of counselor to choose.
