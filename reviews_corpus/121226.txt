"My doctor prescribed venlafaxine nearly a month ago. I did experience headaches and nausea during the first five days; however, they were mild. The first positive effect I noticed related to sadness.  Since I have lost six family members in less than two years (father, sister, and more), I felt there was no end to the depth of my sadness.  With this medication, it has felt like someone slid a manhole cover over my sewer of sadness. The second positive effect related to an eating disorder.  I have been plagued with emotional eating for comfort, out of anxiety, to calm fear, and more for years and years.  Since this medication seems to help me be more emotionally balanced, the compulsion to use food to address feelings has been diminished."
