"I am so grateful to my doctor by putting me on Lexapro. I was suffering many physical aches and pains plus in the end panic attacks I was not depressed I thought but did feel anxious and down especially in the mornings I am late 60&#039;s and guess I am a worrier I reached a point that I couldn&#039;t cope with normal everyday activities and after seeing my doctor she put me on Lexapro Within 3 to 4 weeks it kicked in and I felt back to normal It was amazing no more digestion problems back problems and I now sleep well and wake up happy, and  I do walk each day and life is now much better as I&#039;m able to cope with life and definitely recommend Lexapro. Probably the only side effect is yawning and sleepiness but that&#039;s so much better than insomnia."
