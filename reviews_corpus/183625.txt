"I have been on Cymbalta (60mg) for several years now after trying out several other drugs - none of which worked.  I am also on Wellbutrin and the combination seems to work well for me.  However, I am on a new insurance plan now which is denying coverage for the Cymbalta - insisting that I should use a generic in the general family of anti-depressants.  Cymbalta is prohibitively expensive - my parents are paying for my health insurance - how can I expect them to pay for this medicine too.  When will the insurance companies be held accountable and why do drugs have to cost so much?"
