"I reviewed a number of SNRI medicines in search of one that might work for fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome in addition to major depressive disorder and post traumatic stress disorder. After reading about Savella and finding this review site, I suggested Pristiq to my doctor as it seemed to be a good bet for the ailments I needed relief from. I was diagnosed recently with FM/CFS after 6 months of these conditions. I found Pristiq alleviated the worst of the pain. I still have some and am on 10mg of Elavil to help me &quot;sleep&quot; as the key side effect for me from Pristiq is worsening insomnia. I have a bad case of it and as anyone with FM and/or CFS knows, we only get shallow, mostly broken and non-restorative sleep."
