"I&#039;ve taken escitalopram before and it worked good for my anxiety but I stopped taking it after about two months cause I felt better.  The shortness of breath came back and takes a while to go away.  I can&#039;t even exercise anymore due to it.  I had to resign from the fire academy cause my body could not keep up.  I&#039;ve always been fit.  Anxiety can be really frustrating because of the physical symptoms.   Escitalopram did work for me and fast like within days.  I also had problems having sex, and I love sex.  I was very sexually active in high school and short after until I hit 22.  I&#039;m 28 now.  I have good and bad days, mostly bad.  I want my sex life back, and I want to be able to work out like I used to.  Anyone else have SOB?"
