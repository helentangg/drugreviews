"No antidepressants were working for me so the dr. Put me on brintellix. Diarrhea started three hours after first dose and continued for 12 days. I was on the medication 16 days total. By day 4 I had involuntary muscle twitches which turned into head jerking. By day 14 I had my first seizure while driving then had another seizure at work which caused me to lose my job yesterday (liability issues). This was a scary medicine for me and I&#039;m more depressed now because I lost my job on account of it."
