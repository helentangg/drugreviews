"I was prescribed sertraline 50 mg a day for my general anxiety and depression.  I was reluctant to take it, but did so, only kept the dose to 25mg.  At first, I felt so uninspired and tired, but also saw my anxiety levels go down and my mood go up.  Suicidal thoughts decreased dramatically and  I became much easier to get along with; no more getting all worked up over minor issues, less intense and hyper-reactive to every little thing. Less worrying and fretting. Huge increase in ability to focus/concentrate, especially ability to read again without my mind distracted and reading the same sentence over and over. Initially gained 9 lbs, but lost it all and with a diet plan. I&#039;m thankful for sertraline."
