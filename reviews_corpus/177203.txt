"I used this medication for 3 weeks. It worked so good for my back pain and my anxiety. I was so happy I was finally found something that would help me, get off my pain meds. One day I woke up with chest pains. I thought nothing of it. I went to work and it got worse and My blood pressure was 197/110. I left work, went straight to the ER. We found out this medication side effect was raise blood pressure. I am a healthy 120lb 38yr women. I&#039;m doing much better now. BP is back to normal, but I have pain. Now I&#039;m trying something new with back doctor. I hate pain meds. I been on and off for 5 years. I have herniated disc and bulging and anxiety due to a car accident. I had some signs of chest pain before. So don&#039;t ignore it."
