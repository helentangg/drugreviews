"For the past several months I&#039;ve had horrible PMS symptoms that last for two weeks out of every month. Anxiety, depression, fatigue, mood swings, crying fits, migraines. I would throw things across the room and scream at my fiance&#039;. My doctor prescribed me 10mg/day of fluoxetine. I&#039;ve tried many different antidepressants in the past with no luck, so I had low hopes that this would help. 
I&#039;m so glad I tried this! I&#039;ve been on this for five weeks and the only side effects are it takes me longer to have an orgasm, and my blood pressure is slightly lower. I had no PMS symptoms this month other than being slightly more tired. I feel like my stable, happy self again with no more horrible PMDD."
