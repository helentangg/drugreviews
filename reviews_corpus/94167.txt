"My doctor tried me on this when it first came out. I&#039;m unusually sensitive to medications so we started at 5mg/day. It worked great for about a week. Side effects of nausea, blurry vision,dizziness and itching were bothersome but manageable. We then upped it to 10mg a day. Again, it worked for about a week and then stopped. The nausea was horrible. I was taking it at bedtime with a small snack and Zofran (for nausea) and it still made me sick. I would wake up nauseous &amp; to my feet/ankles itching intensely. Benedryl or other allergy meds would not help. It would last about an hour and then go away...until the next morning. Had to stop after 2 months from the horrible side effects. By that time it had no effect on the depression whatsoever."
