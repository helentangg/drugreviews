"I  just started this med for insomnia and anxiety.  The dr told me to take 75mg.  I got super dizzy, and had to have my husband help me to bed. 
 After reading other comments, I just think I took too much to start with. 
 Maybe I will cut a pill in half and try that.  I need something, that&#039;s for sure.."
