"I took a new job back in 2006 that required me to start work in another city and without my family for six months. I began to suffer from depression and anxiety. At first, I thought I was just homesick for my wife and kids. The depression and anxiety began to grow much more severe - inability to focus at work, incredibly negative outlook on new job and new city, unable to get out of bed, wanting to die to escape the pain. I did not understand what was happening to me. Thank God my wife realized something was wrong. She got me to go to a psychiatrist who prescribed 300 mg Effexor. This saved my career, my marriage, my life. No side effects."
