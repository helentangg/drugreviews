"I am a 45 year old female and have had mild to moderate anxiety for most of my adult life.  I lived with it for years and tried different medications on and off when my level of anxiety increased.  I also tried yoga, meditation, exercise and counselling.  A year ago, a new doctor prescribed 100mg Zoloft 1x/day.  It took about a month for me to feel a difference, but Zoloft has given me the most &quot;normal&quot; feeling of any drug I ever tried.  I do not have sexual side effects, as I did with other antidepressants nor do I feel numb or sleepy throughout the day.  I have gained some weight (15 pounds) over the past year, but I can&#039;t really attribute it just to Zoloft."
