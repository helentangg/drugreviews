"I&#039;m a 52 yr old woman. I&#039;ve been taking Pristiq for 2 months specifically for generalized anxiety disorder hoping that using it will be able to reduce my worrying and to improve my sleeping.  10 years ago I was diagnosed with mild sleep apnea and have been using a CPAP machine so I&#039;m really hoping that reducing my anxiety might mean that I might not need the machine - my new sleep doctor thinks that I may have been misdiagnosed 10 years ago - the results could have gone either way. So far, my anxiety has reduced which is great.  However, my side effects include nighttime hot flashes (affects my sleeping) and decreased ability to have orgasms.  I meet with my doctor in a month to review so I&#039;ll see where I am with it then."
