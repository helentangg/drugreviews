"I have been on Zoloft for about a month now and went from taking 25mg a day to 150mg a day.  I was mildy depressed and had no motivation to enjoy life.  I have to admit that I have felt better inside but still lack motivation.  The side effects are pretty tough, I can&#039;t stop yawning all day long and my sex drive is non-existant. Also having great difficulty in ejaculating. I think the doctor is moving me over to Lexapro."
