"After trying prozac (didn&#039;t like) and wellbutrin (better than prozac but still not terrific), was given Celexa by a new doc. I have dysthmia that increases in winter months (probably due to less light where I live, during the shorter days from Oct-March). Celexa gave me an almost instant &#039;happy&#039; boost and I haven&#039;t been off it for more than 6 mos. for a long time. Pros: more energy, no crying spells when daylight lessens during winter months. Cons: did not work for my GAD (I take alprazolam for that), libido is almost non-existent, and my emotions are somewhat blunted (meaning, I don&#039;t really cry often, when before I used to be emotional over a lot of things...but I can take that!) Impact on libido is the most annoying side effect."
