"This is the first medication I have taken in years that has actually worked in lessening my depressive episodes along with decreasing my anxiety. I have had no significant weight changes (which is important as I am also in recovery from Anorexia Nervosa). For the first time in so long I finally feel better! I am so grateful my Physician Assistant had me switch!
