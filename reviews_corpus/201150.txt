"After less than a month on Zoloft, I could start to feel the effects in full swing. Besides being all around more joyful and talkative, I could see the world open up around me by the way it tamed my anxiety. It entirely reduced the uneasiness I felt when going into public. No longer did my heart palpitate, my body profusely sweat, my hands shake, or my words stumble. 
It did come along with many negative physical effects however. Vomiting, nausea, hunger, heart burn, etc. I feel physically healthier without it, but it cured my social anxiety wonderfully."
