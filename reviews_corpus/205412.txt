"Pristiq is the first medication that worked for me and my brains scattered chemical imbalance issues.
I had tried 3 other types of medication over  8 years, interspersed. While they had helped, even a combination of pills did not cover all that was required with my brain and it&#039;s issues.

I have to say that this is quite a strong drug.  Also, note the possible side-effects before you start.  I, myself, did not any of the side-effects the manufacturer mentioned but when I became pregnant and was breastfeeding I did have to wean off of the medication for safety reasons, obviously, and I did notice a slight withdrawal.  Do not stop taking this medication suddenly.  It, most likely, will not feel good if you do!  As stated, it&#039;s strong."
