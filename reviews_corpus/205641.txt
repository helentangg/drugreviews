"I am a 57 year old male and struggled with anxiety and depression all my life but it peaked about 6 years ago.  I began taking the maximum dosage of Wellbutrin 450mg.  I was better, but not 100%. I would still get that &quot;knot in my stomach&quot; when the anxiety would rise.  I asked my psychiatrist if I could try Pristiq since my mother had good results.  He reduced the Wellbutrin and put me on 50mg of Pristiq.  I started feeling better after about the 3rd week and after a month, those negative thoughts, not being able to live in the present, lack of joy all changed dramatically for the better.  To me, it is a wonder pill - with no side effects at all.
