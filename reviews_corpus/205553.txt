"I&#039;m blown away and I&#039;m only at the end of my first week. Maybe I&#039;m being overly optimistic but I feel amazing! Like I was meant to always feel. I&#039;ve suffered with severe depression and anxiety most of my life tried many medications nothing worked and up until today I thought Pristiq wasn&#039;t for me the first few days were hell. My anxiety shot through the roof had the runs and racing pulse up until I fell asleep last night. Woke up this morning feeling a little groggy, caught the train to work. All of a sudden I feel calm and happy. Seriously this if it stays like this will change my life! I&#039;m sweating a little but nothing too major. My vision seems clearer, I feel more focused already."
