"I&#039;m diagnosed as Bipolar I since one year and an half. Since then, I have tried many medications (almost all available on the market) some anti-psychotics and antidepressants. By far, Zoloft is a miracle drug for me. I had lost all hope to ever feel happy again one day. But this medication finally do the job. I have more energy, a lot less of anxiety, I can focus on the tasks that I want to accomplish in my life. I have tried previously Prozac and Wellbutrin but they didn&#039;t do anything to me. Never give up, finding the right medication can be very long, but when you find it, it worth it. The medication kicked in  after 3 weeks of use."
