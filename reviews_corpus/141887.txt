"I recently started taking Ciprolex (escitalopram) 2 months ago starting with 5mg and doctor increasing it slowly.  Now I&#039;m on 30mg as I have impulsive behavior OCD, anorexia and not sure what else yet.  I have filled out a 7 page question test yes/no to help determine other issues I&#039;m experiencing.  For many years have been on Prozac and  clonazepam but now off Prozac completely as of lately.  I have tried many others such as Zoloft, Paxil, Effexor etc.....with little success.  I really hope that I do get benefits from this one and so far little side effects and seem to be on a more even state, where I can cope bit better day to day.  Hope have helped others with my experiences and I&#039;m trying to still study more on it and if dosage is too much, etc."
