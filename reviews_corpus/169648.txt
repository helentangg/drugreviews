"I have been on Elavil for 7 months now. I take 20mg every night for severe pain in my shoulders, arms and neck and also for depression. It&#039;s the best thing I have taken and I have tried loads of medicine but none have worked. I also couldnt sleep, but now I don&#039;t have pain. I am a lot calmer and I have never slept as good. I haven&#039;t put weight on either. It&#039;s the best tablet that I have been on."
