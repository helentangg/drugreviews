"The Cymbalta took about three weeks to kick in.  The side effects started out really strong; dizziness, sweating, no appetite, sleepiness, dry mouth.  Now I&#039;ve been on one month and all of my side effects are gone.  I don&#039;t have any sexual side effects.  As far as treating my depression it&#039;s amazing.  It&#039;s like the light has been turned on again and I can see the good in life.  Advice; if you&#039;re prescribed this medication, give it a good try - the side effects do diminish.  From what I see here, it seems like this works for a lot of people."
