"On Viibryd for 2 months. I was significantly nauseous every time I had to up the dosage. (I&#039;m at 40 mg now, but moved from 10&gt;20&gt;40).  I have some OCD related to my anxiety/depression, and in that department, I&#039;ve seen amazing results. I wouldn&#039;t say I&#039;m cured, but this medicine has made life MUCH easier when dealing with these unwanted and uncontrollable habits. No weight gain or libido decrease. The downside has been a noticeable decrease in energy and racing heart rate at times. All in all, it&#039;s definitely worth it for me. DO NOT suddenly stop taking it...slowly decrease the dosage. The electric shock-like feelings happened to me, and while they aren&#039;t exactly painful, they&#039;re definitely uncomfortable and made it impossible for me to fall asleep."
