"I started Paxil 1 week ago and I have only had one little attack. It has given me more energy for work! But I do find myself going home after work and taking a nap! The only bad thing about it so far is I&#039;m clenching my jaw a lot causing my back teeth to hurt and can&#039;t really chew that well, may be why I am losing weight also! But it has made my life a lot easier so far! From before I&#039;d have to miss work because of my anxiety!"
