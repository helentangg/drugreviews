"I have been on Celexa for about 4 months now. I was diagnosed with depression when I was 13 (hereditary). At first my mother had me go to therapy for help. The therapy helped me figure myself out but didn&#039;t help me with my depression. I switched doctors and my new doctor prescribed me Celexa. It helped me considerably with my depression and my anxiety and stress problems. I take a small dose at night along with a herbal supplement to help me sleep. I don&#039;t feel hopeless or &quot;boxed&quot; anymore. I really like this medication and I plan to stick with it for a while."
