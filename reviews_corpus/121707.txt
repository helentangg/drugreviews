"I love it. I get dizzy and almost black out when I hop up. So I learned to get up slow. My pain has turned dull now instead of sharp and menacing like it&#039;s been for almost 5 yrs. Taking this with Oxycodone and Robaxin helps me get through each day. Still not well enough where I can exercise due to horrible muscle inflammation. Started on the 25mg...moved to 75mg...now I&#039;m taking the 150mg XR and I can say that I think I should stay here."
