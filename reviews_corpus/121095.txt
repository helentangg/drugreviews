"I have been taking Effexor for three years now and I&#039;ve had good luck with it. I take 150 mg per day. I have panic disorder and depression and Effexor has been a godsend. I haven&#039;t had a panic attack since I started it 3 years ago. The only downside is if you miss a dose you really feel it."
