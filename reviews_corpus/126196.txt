"I have been on Celexa and Paxil about 11 years ago, when my third daughter was born to deal with depression and anxiety (she has severe health issues and disabilities). I had gained a total of 60 pounds so after a year I stopped taking them. Felt too medicated and hated the weight gain. Since then I recently lost my mom and have a lot of stress, very depressed crying all the time, felt I had nothing to look forward to. I went to my psychiatrist and he prescribed Viibryd. I have had a great experience, I am also on Wellbutrin. This cocktail is great for me, I don&#039;t feel medicated, very positive feelings, I am very up and don&#039;t have mood swings or outbursts of anger. I have a great sex drive, I don&#039;t argue with my husband anymore."
