"I was taking fluoxetine on a 40mg dose for just over 2 years for severe anxiety. I found it just made me extremely tired and quite numbed to daily life which was no good for my 5 year old child to see that I wasn&#039;t great showing my emotions. 
I suffer bad with travelling as I feel enclosed and I can&#039;t go to the toilet which brings on sweaty palms, tense muscles, holding my breathe without realising it and upset bowels and feeling I need to go both ways constantly. Fluoxetine didn&#039;t help reduce any of these physical symptoms only the psyochological side making me feel zoned out from the world (not great when you have children) now I am about to go on a different medication citalpram I am hoping this helps"
