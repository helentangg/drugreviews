"I started off with seralitine (generic for zoloft),100mg it lifted my mood, I was happier, less angry, calm, and it helped with my moods before my cycle came along. After a while it started to wear off so I started taking 150mg, finally I increased it to 200mg with my docs permission. I loved this dose because it seemed to suit me better, but after a while I noticed my hair shedding really bad. So I switched back to 150mg and it stopped. Everyone is different with side effects but I recommend this drug. It has changed my life for the better, it helps my anxiety,and it helps me not to worry as much. I&#039;m glad I tried it. It does mess with sex drive but some maybe able to work around that."
