"It works great if it works for you but if you have the problem where medication suddenly stops for no apparent reason then you could be in for a nightmare, like I was in for a whole year still going through it but not as bad. It more so numbs you that you don&#039;t worry about your physical aspects of anxiety and works great for mood but if it &quot;poops out&quot; on you then be prepared to fight the withdrawals."
