"My postpartum depression, emotional outbursts, and anxiety was intense and Zoloft brought me immediate relief. In time, I felt that this medication provided me with a steady platform for me to function in life with. I can still cry, but my constant sadness is gone. I still feel emotion, but my uncontrollable outbursts ended. I can&#039;t seem to loose weight, but who knows if it is related to the Zoloft. I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll take Zoloft forever, but it sure has made a TREMENDOUS difference!"
