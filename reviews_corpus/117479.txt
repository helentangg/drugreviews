"Have been on 10mg Nortripine for almost a month now and have not found it helpful at all. I have 2 tumours on my liver and they are painful most of the time. I have found that since l started taking the Nortripine my moods have been more up and down and my downs are considerable. I am now going to ask doctor for antidepressants. 15-20 minutes after I take my pill each night I get really itchy all over my body for about 10 minutes and then it suddenly stops. I have also found that I have really vivid and scary dreams now of being chased. I also take Tramadols to manage pain levels but have found that since starting Nortripine l can no longer drive after taking Tramadol, previously l managed fine. I have found no improvement in my pain levels"
