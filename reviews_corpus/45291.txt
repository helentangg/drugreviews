"After being suicidal for many months and self harming in addition to extreme anxiety. I had taken Prozac  6 years earlier and didn&#039;t work at all has NOW almost eliminated my depression. I feel happier than I have in years. The only downside is I have gained about 20 lbs. My lowest weight was 133, considered healthy for someone 5&#039;7 and athletic, but despite my clean eating and exercise I&#039;ve blown up to 163 lbs in 2 years and nothing seems to get the weight off. This has been my only negative side effect. I choose my mental health over my body image although I also have an eating disorder BDD."
