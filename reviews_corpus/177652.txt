"I have been on Cymbalta for the last 2 weeks. The side effects have been difficult, stomach pain, the first few nights I couldn&#039;t sleep and thoughts raced through my mind, I was also having severe suicidal thoughts and I was still waking up from the pain and tingling sensation in my arms and shoulders. this is week three and I find that my mood has improved, but I&#039;m sweating a lot. the fibro pain is present and I&#039;m tired a lot. I tried taking it at night but find my chest hurting the next day so I switched to mornings on a full stomach and that&#039;s improved the stomach pain. I have restless leg and if I&#039;m late on taking my next dose I&#039;m jittery. I don&#039;t really know if its working for my pain, but my mood is much better, I&#039;m not suicidal."
