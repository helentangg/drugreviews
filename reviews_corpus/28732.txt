"I have been depressed my whole life. A few gears ago I contracted HIV and that sent me over the edge. I lived in a personal hell for years and was hesitant to take an antidepressant. Within two days of taking it I was a totally different person. It was like my eyes had only seen black and white. My life is now full of color and I am so grateful that there are people out there that design medicines like this. I will never stop taking Lexapro. If you are depressed please give antidepressants a try. Don&#039;t wait for years to get help when it is available!"
