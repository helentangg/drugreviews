"My doctor has been wanting me to go on Lexapro for over a year for severe GAD. But I had so much anxiety about going on it I wouldn&#039;t start it. I&#039;ve been taking Buproprion &amp; Topamax for depression &amp; anxiety for years but it has worn off. I was to the point that thought I was always dying - and always felt sick. My regular doctor said get on Lexapro it&#039;s all stress related - there is nothing physically wrong with you. I&#039;ve had anxiety my whole life and I&#039;m 57. I have been in several abusive relationships. I haven&#039;t been in any in almost 20 years but the anxiety hasn&#039;t gone away. The first week I had a little upset stomach but nothing after that no side affects at all and now I&#039;m calm for the first time in my life!!"
