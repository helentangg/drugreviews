"I started taking this a couple of years ago during the end of a very stressful relationship. I started with 10 mg and eventually went up to the 20mg. This higher dose made me jittery and nervous. I couldn&#039;t concentrate or focus. I went back to the 10mg and stayed there. I feel happy and at ease. I laugh and little things don&#039;t make me have panic attacks. I have tried a couple of times to stop using this and within a few weeks the smallest things make me want to give up and send me into a few day depression. I would like to stop taking it and be my normal self. I love that I feel great on it but want to learn to feel this way without it as well."
