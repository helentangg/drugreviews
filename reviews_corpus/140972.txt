"I have suffered depression since I can remember but was determined never to take anti depressants. After a heart attack my depression worsened and even though my surgeon, doctor and psychologist recommended I try antidepressants I refused. Finally in desperation I went to my doctor and asked for some He prescribed escitalopram at 10 mg per day. Within 2 weeks I noticed a reduction in both anxiety and depression. It didn&#039;t remove the symptoms but did improve them to the extent I never want to go off them. I told my doctor who increased the dose to 20 mg per day. My anxiety and depression symptoms have continued to improve. I have put on about 3 ks in weight but no other side effects except dry mouth at night."
