"It took a few months for it to start to settle in, I think, but  total game changer. 6 months ago I was in an awful state due to undiagnosed OCD &amp; depression. Started going to therapy and taking prozac and now it feels like I&#039;m standing on more solid ground. I haven&#039;t felt this good in years and feel silly for my past apprehension at trying SSRIs.

Only side effects I&#039;ve noticed are I&#039;m a bit sleepy throughout the day and I&#039;m having vivid dreams most nights (never remembered my dreams before taking prozac) but no complaints about the latter. Recently bumped up to 30 mg after being on 20 for a few months to try and kick the last of the obsessive thoughts. Really couldn&#039;t recommend enough. I can only hope this keeps working."
