"I had been hesitant about taking an SSRI but my anxiety &amp; depression had begun to take over my life. I realized that I needed to take control of my emotions in order to improve my life and therapy alone was not cutting it. The first 2 weeks were tough. I was yawning CONSTANTLY and just plain exhausted. Now, 1 month later at 20mg I feel AMAZING. A weight has been lifted off of my shoulders &amp; I am HAPPY. I don&#039;t get stressed &amp; my anxiety is gone. The only negative is that I have gained 5lbs. I DEFINITELY recommend citalopram to anyone who struggles with generalized anxiety disorder and depression."
