"For those of you who are having bad side effects, PLEASE try Viibryd for at least 3 weeks.  After two weeks, I begged my doctor to change my script to something else, but he told me to wait one more week.  I could not believe the difference that week made!  Viibryd is the best medicine I have ever taken! I felt like the REAL ME. Too bad my insurance wont cover it and my doctor ran out of samples."
