"My doctor prescribed me celexa ten days ago as I suffer from bad anxiety attacks im also diabetic so she thinks the anxiety is brought on because of my unstable blood sugars ...the attacks were making my life hell also being a mum of three this was just not good ... I&#039;m not sure on how I feel at the moment ???...i sweat so much feel sick and like I&#039;m high on drugs ( such a weird feeling ) but I get a moment in the day where I feel okish and can see hope at the end of the tunnel .. I&#039;m not sure if this means the tablets are working or not ?? I hope they do :))"
