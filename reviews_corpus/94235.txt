"I&#039;ve been battling MDD for about ten years now and I&#039;ve been on and off many different medications.  My biggest complaint with most of them was the fatigue.  I&#039;m only 24, but while I was on this medication it was hard for me to keep up with my friends that were similar ages.  I was always tired, always taking naps and still going to bed early. With Brintellix, the fatigue is GONE! It&#039;s easier for me to wake up, I can do more during the day without wanting to take a nap and having more energy has given me the opportunity to start exercising again.  I do have a bit of stomach upset while taking it, but it is mild and, frankly, a smile price to pay when considering all the good Brintellix does for me."
