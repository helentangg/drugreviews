"I have been taking Prozac for about four years.  My worst symptoms were: very disturbing, vivid dreams that affected my sleep; having feelings of uncontrollable anger; feeling hopeless and powerless, and wanting to give up at the slightest difficulty.  Being on Prozac has been wonderful for me.  The nightmares have pretty much gone away, I am much more calm and patient, and I can deal with the unexpected problems in life much better.  I think Prozac made it possible for me to finish grad school and has helped my career.  I don&#039;t feel addicted to it - in fact, I frequently forget to take it for several days or even a week or more, but when I notice the nightmares or anxiety coming back, I know it&#039;s time for me to take it again."
