"Developed a prolapsed disk during pregnancy which caused burning/throbbing sciatica all down right leg. I could only sleep for a maximum of two hours at night before the pain woke me up and it was also pretty grim throughout the day. Worked my way up to 20mg of Amitriptyline (5mg more every few days) and found that after several weeks the pain had reduced greatly. After a few months tried reducing dose to 15mg (due to side effects of tiredness and feeling groggy in the morning) but the pain returned so increased dose back to 20mg and pain has gone again. This drug might not suit everyone but for me the benefits of this medication definitely outweigh the side effects and I shall be continuing to take it."
