"I can truly say that so far this medication has literally saved my life. I have suffered from depression for the past two and a half years . In December of 2016 it got out of control. I hit the lowest point in my life out of nowhere. I tried my hardest to get out of the most horrible depression and anxiety that one could ever experience in life. Thoughts became obsessive and I got insomnia. I prayed, I ate better, I tried and I tried to beat this beast all by myself, but the harder I tried the more I felt that I was sinking . I decided to try antidepressants and the first I was given was lexapro. Lexapro was horrible for me, and then my Dr suggested Zoloft. I was so hesitant, but I&#039;m glad I gave it a try. Don&#039;t give up!!"
