"On Zolft 25 mg / day and my anxiety attacks have stopped. I haven&#039;t woken up depressed (used to wake up depressed and stay in bed) or had suicidal thoughts (had suicidal thoughts almost daily.)  It&#039;s like this medicine has filled in the blanks for me. I don&#039;t feel high or euphoric or excited or anything other than what I think normal must feel like. It&#039;s quite a change from what I was used to, nonstop anxiety, depression and I was always thinking about suicide but all that has stopped and is a thing of the past. I can&#039;t even believe I was feeling like that. I now know that something was wrong with my brain and this medicine has fixed it for me. I am so happy to wake up not feeling sad."
