"I have been taking these since 2011- 2016. At first they helped decrease my panic attacks but it came with a price. The negative side effects were emptiness, fogginess, poor concentration, worsening social skills, apathy, constant worrying, mania. I was really unmotivated to do things, I didn&#039;t care about anything. I just wanted to workout and eat which also didn&#039;t make me happy. I didn&#039;t realize it was because of these pills until I started switching to zoloft. 

Now I feel much better. Also I got frequently gastritis from them. Glad I&#039;m off them, feel like they stole years from my life without me knowing. I didn&#039;t notice they caused all this probably because I was have so many panic attacks frequently when I started with them."
