"After reading some of these comments I realize I&#039;m not alone I just broke down about an hour ago not understanding why am so depressed I&#039;m not sad but I&#039;m depressed I am a cancer patient  that is 40 years old and I&#039;ve been battling cancer and severely depressed since I was 24 I just recently spent a month in bed because I was in such horrible pain I finally ended up in the hospital because my cancers back once again and they  upped my dose from 30 mg to 60 mg to help with pain and depression. I haven&#039;t noticed that it helps with any pain but I have had all the side effects but I&#039;ve read in these comments I&#039;m so glad I found this now I know to stop taking this med but I&#039;m terrified of the side effects  to come I haven&#039;t worked since January 5 I get discharge from the hospice house on February 20 and all I can do is go to the bathroom and lay in my chair I&#039;m fighting so hard to be happy  but nothing is working"
