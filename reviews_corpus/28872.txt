"I started taking this medication 3 days ago at 10mg for mild depression and anxiety. I feel it works very well. I see the sexual side effects but I am hopeful they will go away. Other side effects went away after my 4th day (today). So far so good. I feel the black cloud lifting from head. I hope it continues."
