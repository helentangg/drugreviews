"After being diagnosed with severe, chronic and acute depression, anxiety and seasonal affective disorder in February 2001, my therapist referred me to a psychiatrist for medicine management. Was given starter pack September 2011. I&#039;ve been on 40mg for 1 and 1/2 years, during my weekly therapy sessions, my therapist says I give 90% eye contact, whereas with previous medicines I gave eye contact infrequently. I also take Effexor 225mg, Zoloft 200mg and 9mg Ativan [2mg A.M.; 4mg 12:00pm; 3mg evenings], Ambien 10mg."
