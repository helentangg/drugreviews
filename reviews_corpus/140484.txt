"I&#039;ve suffered from SEVERE ANXIETY the last 8 yrs after my mom passed away when I was only 15. I was embarrassed to go to the doctors to even ask for help. I close myself from being around other people  because I don&#039;t want them to feel weird around me. I took 20 mg for the first time today of this medicine. I feel different..more relaxed..and more energized and settle. I hope it continues to work this good 4me. Its only my first day but I&#039;m loving it already!"
