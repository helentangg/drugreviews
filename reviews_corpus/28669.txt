"I&#039;m 39, male, 6&#039;3, 230 lbs. Suffered from anxiety disorder for years. Worrying, palpitations, shortness of breath, basically all the popular anxiety symptoms. Seemed to come on more when I pushed myself exercising. Back on Lexapro because it does work. Side effects like lower sex drive, difficulty reaching orgasm, insomnia all go away. I find myself fearless, my life is active, no more &quot;what if&#039;s&quot; and no anxiety attacks. I admit I hate taking medicines, but without it is far worse."
