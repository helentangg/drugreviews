"I had a life changing event and I noticed that I was not able to &quot;balance&quot; work, home (mom) and other things. I&#039;ve been on Zoloft for almost 2 yrs. And thank goodness! I don&#039;t think I would have handled what I did as well as I did had I not been on it. I don&#039;t really notice any side effects for me."
