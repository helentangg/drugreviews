"I have used Celexa and its generic since 2001. I had suffered from undiagnosed anxiety and depression for years before seeking therapy and medication. At first Celexa was a godsend. In the space of 3 weeks I went from 8 severe anxiety attacks a day less than 8 in the last 9 years. I became more outgoing and confident as a result. I did and continue to have side effects. The long terms effects are basically flat effect, weight gain, increased appetite (I don&#039;t need either of those) and sexual indifference. The later is very difficult to live with as you might imagine. I have tried to ween myself off Celexa once, in 2005, and it was an unqualified disaster. I guess I&#039;m a &quot;lifer&quot;."
