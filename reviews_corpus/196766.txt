"Stopped periods 10 years ago. Then suffered  hot flashes, severe, in first five years after.   In last five years hot flashes really diminished but triggered by anxiety, certain foods, and occasional night sweats. But could be counted on to have at least one episode of night sweats per evening (down from as many as 7 to 10 a day - and leaving me drenched, my clothes soaked!).  My GYN recommended Brisdelle two months ago.  Am hypersensitive to all meds so was skeptical, in addition to being an RN.  Don&#039;t like to take drugs of any kind.  However, I was desperate.  The Brisdelle worked immediately and I haven&#039;t had one episode of hot flashes since.  Just dry mouth now.  Very bad dry mouth!"
