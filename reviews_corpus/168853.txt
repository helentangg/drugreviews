"Was on this medication for 5-6 weeks. Titrated up to 40mg, but this made my anxiety so bad (mostly physiological), that I went back down to 30mg. Was only on 40mg for a few days. Got my first brain zap, and accompanying psychosis with full blown auditory hallucinations. That&#039;s when I knew it was time to quit. Viibryd isn&#039;t as bad at inhibiting sexual desire as other SSRIs, but it STILL does! For anxiety, this medication wasn&#039;t helpful- but I did notice myself in a more positive and upbeat mood (for what that&#039;s worth). After spending a total of 4-5 hours researching this drug, and hearing about what it&#039;s like if you forget to take your dose (even if you&#039;re an hour off)- I was scared straight. Weaned myself off FAST (5mg reduction per night)."
