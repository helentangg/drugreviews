"I took this for over a year at age 20 it got me out of a depressing time. I have always been a VERY shy person and quiet. Literally a day or two after I started taking this I was with some friends and I was like the center of the conversation. I felt like all the mental stuff holding me back was gone! I started thinking more positively while I was on this. I still had bad days, I was unemployed at the time but got through it. I did gain 25lbs while on this.
I finally got to a point where I wasn&#039;t depressed anymore and was beginning to over react to situations and was getting a discontented/sad feeling where I felt like I had to be doing something so I stopped cold turkey and was okay. I lost all 25 lbs, quieter self is back and depression free."
