"I wouldn&#039;t try this or Lyrica again.  I have had fibromyalgia since before the doctor knew what it was.  No drug has been worth taking because of the side effects.  They eventually lose some effectiveness, then the doctors want to up the dosage or give another.  I&#039;ve gained 100 pounds.  I&#039;m sick all of the time.  The depression does not go away.  I think the added weight is worse on my body than the original symptoms."
