"I&#039;ve been on Effexor XR, Celexa, Wellbutrin, Zoloft, Paxil, and combinations thereof for over 10 years. Out of all of them, Lexapro, for me, had the best benefits to side effects ratio. The only side effect has been modest weight gain below 10 pounds, and reducing my dosage to 5 mg almost always reveals that the medication was what caused it. I could be in the worst loop of hopelessness, feeling that I am nothing but an object in time, and have the worst of identity issues, either for no reason, or because, normally some aspect of my life or even circumstance that was confronted. Lexapro takes me out of that, helps me focus again, relieves me from believing the pain will be permanent, so I can once again address my thoughts appropriately."
