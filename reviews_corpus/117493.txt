"I took the first dose at night because my doc said it may cause sleepiness. I woke up in the middle of the night with a terrible headache and insomnia. Decided to try a second night. This time, no headache but still insomnia. Last night I took my 10th dose and I am awake 2 hours after falling asleep then having a horrible, horrible nightmare about sexual situations, being part of murders, and my son being kidnapped by a killer clown. I know that sounds dumb, but it was extremely realistic and now I can&#039;t go back to sleep. 
I will call my doc in a few hours to discuss tapering off and quitting this med all together. My pain has not been relieved at all (even if it had, I could continue with the insomnia and graphic nightmares)."
