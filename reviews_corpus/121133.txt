"I started taking Effexor following an unexpected divorce that left me feeling a significant grief and anxiety for my children&#039;s future. I never had suicidal thoughts before, during or after taking this drug.  I took it for 2 years and I don&#039;t know if it helped me, or if it was the meditation (Qigong)  or acceptance and reflection.

Some side effects included increased libido, occasional little spasms of the diaphragm muscle (at the base of the lungs), and strange and vivid dreams.  Missing only one dose sent me into what is known as &quot;brain zaps&quot;, and feels just like electrical zaps in the brain, together with sensory dissociation. This is the main reason I was afraid to stop taking it."
