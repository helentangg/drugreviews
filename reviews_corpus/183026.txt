"I was on celexa for a few yrs.n when I started feeling &quot;well&quot; again decided to stop taking it. Within a yr. I was constantly crying n went back on it but it affected my ability to Fully enjoy intimacy so the mental health nurse told me ask my Dr.for pristine, which I did n he prescribed my cymbalta instead which I took a long with my celexa. When I went back to c him he said that he told me stop the celexa n prescribed me 60mg.of cymbalta a day which I now have been on for about a yr. To say it&#039;s a godsend is an understatement. I actually went to an outside concert with approx.5000 people in attendance. Although I was still a little anxious a couple drinks helped me to somewhat enjoy myself. Normally crowds cause me unbearable anxiety."
