"After having tendonitis surgery on my elbow I ended up with a nerve disorder and fibromyalgia. I just finished school and was starting my career when all of this happened so I also am having depression and anxiety issues. My doctor put me on Neurontin and Effexor.  Effexor was not doing much for any of my symptons, so they just switched me to Cymbalta last week. They had me take 30mg for the first few days then bumped it to 60mg.  So far I feel like a zombie.. so tired.. I tried taking it in the morning but I was extemely tired, so I now take it at night.  I sleep like a log! "
