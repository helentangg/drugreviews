"After struggling for what felt like years I decided to go to the doctors who referred me to a therapist, i felt like that was working and I was cleared by her. After a couple of months the stress of day to day life as well as studying in Sixth Form got too much for me and I felt like I had fallen into the same problem as before. I visited the doctors again and i got put on 50g sertraline, i have been on them for about 6 weeks now and i have never felt so low before. the side effects i have received are feeling depressed and suicidal thoughts, i have never felt this low before in my whole entire life."
