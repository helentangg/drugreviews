"I&#039;ve suffered severe anxiety/panic attacks my entire life. I&#039;ve had Xanax, Valium, Prozac and Edronax over the cause of my years. I finally changed doctor, came off everything, to start where I&#039;m at now. I began on 37.5mg over two weeks ago and noticed a difference straight away. Now on 75mg and getting better every single day. My panic attacks could cause me to pass out, so this is a huge leap in health for me. For those concerned about coming off Xanax, it&#039;s so worth the effort. I now feel like I&#039;m getting my life back and I&#039;m truly grateful."
