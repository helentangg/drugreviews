"I have MDD. I have been on several antidepressants over the past 13 years.
Been using Viibryd 40mg for about 9 months.  The first 2 weeks were hell but my doctor assured me it would get better and it did.  My only major complaint: When I miss a dose I FEEL IT. I get dizzy, blurred vision and a severe headache.  I mean miss a dose by several hours, not a day or two! I previously stepped down off of Zoloft because of the same issues but I set a reminder on my cell phone to take my meds at 8:30am and I keep a few pills in my car and my purse just in case I have not eaten by 8:30am."
