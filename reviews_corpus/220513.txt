"After 20 years of migraine suffering I went private and was prescribed Amitriptyline 10mg.  I took these for 5 months and barely had a headache never mind migraine.  I got dry mouth and my sleeping improved also.  However after 5 months the migraines have started to come back so I increased the dosage to 20-25mg, again the first few weeks I noticed the dry mouth and disturbed sleeping but this has not settled down again and migraine free.  It&#039;s the best medicine I&#039;ve ever had and had also helped with my neck and arm pain.  I couldn&#039;t recommend it enough, a lifesaver."
