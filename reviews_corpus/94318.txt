"I had been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and have been treated with medicines that at that time were the best. Venlafaxine being the latest. However the effects were decreasing over time. 12 years and has so many side effects. Now I am on Brintellix 20mg daily...wow there is life. My mood is elevated, my outlook and self esteem and confidence has returned to normal. My energy level has skyrocketed.  My sleep is more restful. Negative thoughts are diminished. Day to day living is now controllable. Clear thought process not drugged feeling. A very content person. Focus on the enabling versus the negativity. Started on 10mg daily increased to 20mg after 3 weeks and a slow reduction in my venlafaxine.  One side effect is nausea I noted but a dry snack helps"
