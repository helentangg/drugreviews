"I have been taking Pristiq for the treatment of bipolar disorder to treat my depression issues.  As for the depression it has helped a lot (I was locked into a depressive state for months).  I have been on this medication for about 3 weeks and so far have lost about 15lbs (I have been working out as well). Anyone who knows how hard it is to lose weight while on bipolar medicines will know it&#039;s heaven sent.  "
