"Effexor has helped me so much. I used to self harm, have suicidal thoughts, no motivation &amp; a lot of panic attacks. The first couple weeks taking effexor is a little weird, but once it&#039;s better once you&#039;re past the uptake. Ever since I&#039;ve been on effexor I stopped having suicidal thoughts completely, and has helped my anxiety so much. &amp; I would never even think of self harming again. This medication saved my life. But I will say the withdrawal symptoms are terrible so be careful."
