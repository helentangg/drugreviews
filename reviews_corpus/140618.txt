"I decided to try Escitalopram after battling severe anxiety and depression for over 4 years. The initial side effects were extremely hard to cope with. I personally couldn&#039;t work for the first 5 days. I struggled to concentrate, function normally and just slept all the time. After about day 10-11, I was feeling good but a bit zombie-like as if I was living but not really emotionally there. My doctor recommended I start taking 20mg after 1 month of taking 10mg. I&#039;m now on week 9 and feeling somewhat normal again. It&#039;s been a trip out to wonder whether this is the actual happy me that went missing or whether everything is just being masked. Overall I am happy and my anxiety and depression has vanished. Still can&#039;t cry though."
