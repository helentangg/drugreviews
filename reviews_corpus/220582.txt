"I&#039;ve been getting moderate migraines and missing school because of them and they were causing a lot of stress and my grades were dropping. Now I take amitriptyline 10mg morning and night and if I didn&#039;t have much sleep or other problems I get these pseudo migraines which feel similar without being miserable and having a lot of pain and symptoms. I used to get migraines from too little fluids so I don&#039;t know if the medicines are causing the dry mouth or if I have it anyway. I don&#039;t get sleepiness during the day, but I do get 9 1/2 hrs to sleep (I&#039;m a teenager and I need that much sleep). It also helped me with social anxiety which I&#039;ve dealt with all my life. Only problem is if I skip a night dose, I wake up feeling stressed and headachy."
