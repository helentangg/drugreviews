"Paxil works great for me but it took 3 months for it to work. That&#039;s not surprising however my body has always taken a long time to get used to/accept drugs. My start up side effects were extreme fatigue, excessive yawning, derealization, depersonalization, depression and apathy(apathy and depression could&#039;ve been a result for the anxiety and not the paxil) . One day while at work it just hit me and I started feeling better happier but not 100%. I&#039;m currently at 30mg which seems to work fine. The only bad thing about being on Paxil for me is the sexual side effects(it is really hard to climax! uhg) Otherwise, I feel fine. In fact, I even have vivid dreams, which for me is nice, and more energy."
