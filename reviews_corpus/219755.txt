"I suffered a blown disk in my back partially crushing my spinal cord after months of pain after op that was not that successful. My leg still had jumping nerve pain if you put your hand on my lower leg you can feel a can of worms jumping which was just my nerves. After many combinations of drugs my doc put me on Endep. I needed 150mg for my brain to stop feeling this nerve pain. I have been on it for 7 years dropped to 100mg now. I have tried to lower dose on many occasions though pain breaks through so 100mg it is for me. Still get some pain at times and if you put your hand on my leg it jumps around like crazy but I don&#039;t feel it great drug at the right dose"
