"For the first 5 days I was excessively happy, I felt like I had finally found a medicine that was really going to work for me though the cost was a concern, my Dr was helping out with samples to see how it affected me as I am also ADHD, have an anxiety disorder, PTSD and other medical issues. On day 6 my face started tingling. Then I noticed that things didn&#039;t taste right like coffee no longer had flavor, soda tasted funny and so on. Later that day I was trying to talk to my dad and I kept losing words, my speech was very impaired and I felt so itchy all over like fire ants were biting me. I called my Dr who told me to stop it immediately. I stopped and my depression has worsened, my anxiety is worse and my speech is still impaired."
