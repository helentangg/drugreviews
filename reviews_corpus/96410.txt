"This medicine is literally my savior, as far as medicine goes. I couldn&#039;t eat, sleep, or even function because my anxiety level was so ridiculously high. It drastically improved my hypochondrism and my fear of eating, and allows me to do things just like everyone else. I love it; and although during the first few weeks my side effects included twitching and shaking, it was very much worth it. Almost all of my side effects are gone, besides the slight inability to orgasm. I would definitely recommend it! "
