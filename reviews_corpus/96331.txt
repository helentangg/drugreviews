"I started using Zoloft at the recommendation of my doctor who thought I may be experiencing mild depression.  I take 25 mg before bedtime and have been able to sleep peacefully (one thing I could not do before Zoloft).  I am not sure if my better overall mood is because of the drug or the fact that I am finally getting sleep at night, but I no longer burst into tears, scream at my family or contend with overwhelming negativity as I was prior to taking Zoloft.  The symptoms associated with PMS have definitely improved, as well.  I had side effects (shaking, dilated pupils, nausea) for the first two weeks, but have been fine since.  My doctor recommended that I take vitamin B with the medication daily - works well."
