"The first 4 weeks on Prozac were awful. I had zero appetite, vivid nightmares, horrible night sweats, and a very short temper. But all of a sudden when week 6 rolled around, I felt like a new person! I was the &quot;old me&quot; again. It felt amazing to hear my family tell me they could notice the change in me. I&#039;m a much more productive person now! I&#039;m thriving at work, and I&#039;m so thankful I found this drug."
