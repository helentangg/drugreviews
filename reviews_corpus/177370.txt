"My personal advice to anyone thinking of starting Cymbalta, don&#039;t do it. I only wish someone told me before I took it. Granted, it did take the edge off of some of my pain short term. The side effects just aren&#039;t worth it. 

I was fortunate enough to only suffer mood swings, anger, brain zaps and so on for about a month because I wasn&#039;t on it that long.

They don&#039;t tell you that once you start taking Cymbalta, it&#039;s near impossible for someone to safely come off on their own if they have been on it more than a couple of months. 

Just please do your research. Some people have had great success but others barely lived to tell their horror stories and others aren&#039;t here"
