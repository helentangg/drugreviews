"I&#039;ve been on this medication for one week so far, and I already notice a difference in myself.  It is certainly helping me- I suffered from severe anxiety/ anxiety attacks over the past several months, and I haven&#039;t had a single attack since being on this medication.  The anxiety has also lessened.  I&#039;ll up my dose soon, so it should continue to kick in and help.  "
