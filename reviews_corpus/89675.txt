"I started using Celexa in 2005 following the death of my best friend and other things that I could no longer cope with. I had suffered from depression on and off since I was a teenager. 
Some of the side effects I initially experienced was fatigue and dry mouth - that went away...then the excessive sweating started. After a while, I tried to go off it because I thought &quot;well I&#039;m feeling normal, and I&#039;m tired of constant sweating&quot;. I started the slow weaning off process and bugger all, I felt myself getting more and more withdrawn and the excessive moodiness and depressed thoughts were coming back. Went back on it. 
It&#039;s helped me immensely, but like any pharmaceutical - doesn&#039;t have the same effects on everybody. It&#039;s working for me!"
