"The medicine helped with my depression at first, but eventually stopped working and needed to be increased. I completely lost all of my sex drive and that was very disappointing, as that leads to frustration which leads to depression. I stopped taking Prozac and still have no sex drive which is apparently very common. I would not recommend this medicine."
