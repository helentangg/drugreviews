"Started on 20mg per day increasing after a few weeks.
At first I had the expected nausea, dizziness and feeling of being slightly out of it.  However I was told to push through and give them &ldquo;time to settle&rdquo;. Mistake!
My symptoms quickly worsened to hot flushes with profuse sweating and a pounding heartbeat where just being inside the house was way too warm.  
Then the mental confusion worsened to the point where I couldn&rsquo;t even work out simple things like how much money to give when I went shopping.  I was getting very confused and clumsy, dropping things and tripping over my own feet.
