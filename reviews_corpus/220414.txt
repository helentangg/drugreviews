"As far as helping me with my migraines it helped out a lot. I had absolutely none after 3 weeks of taking the medication, however it made me feel like a zombie throughout the day and for some reason when I didn&#039;t take it exactly on time I wouldn&#039;t be unable to fall asleep at night. I also gained a great amount of weight. "
