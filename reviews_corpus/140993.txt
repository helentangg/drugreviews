"Great drug - I was bed bound for months with crippling anxiety. I&#039;m out the house, I&#039;m back at work. I&#039;ve met the love of my life and I can&#039;t thank the psychiatrist who prescribed me this with quetiapine (serequel) 150mg at night. Don&#039;t just rely on the nhs for your mental health needs. I was lucky enough for my parents to send me to a private practioner who prescribed this combination and it genuinely saved my life. (I am based in the UK) (I am taking 20mg daily)"
