"I&#039;m a person who suffers from bipolar or (manic depression). Before I found out what my diagnosis I had a really low self esteem I would be consistently having break downs and panic attacks but now Cymbalta has stabilized my mood a lot better then it was. I&#039;ve been on it for 2 1/2 yrs and yeah they&#039;ll be times where I have a breakdown or panic attacks once in awhile but they are not so constant. I also hear voices in my head and thats the only thing that Cymbalta doesn&#039;t take away is the voices."
