"I&#039;m 48. First time I had an anxiety in the grocery store, and a few other times, it scared me, did not want to feel that feeling again. I checked with my Doctor and he prescribe me this medication. I was very nervous to take such a thing, because I&#039;ve never been on this or any other medicines. So he started me on a small dose. I&#039;ve been on for 4 weeks now. The first 2 days I had some side affects with a headache and not sleeping. On the 3rd day the side affects went away. The 5th day I started to feel good to go outside, walk the dog, just to get out of the house and get back to normal things that I used to do. I&#039;m very happy that I started this medicine. I&#039;m hoping that I won&#039;t have to take it for long. The medicine is awesome! Wish you well!"
