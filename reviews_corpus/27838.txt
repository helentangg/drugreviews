"Wow, just wow. It&#039;s been almost going on 2 months, and I feel like a completely better person. First of all hang in there. Side effects are hard the first week but you will get levelled out. I go to the gym and don&#039;t have an anxiety attack and run out after only 30 minutes thinking I&#039;m dying. The fear factor has went away and that&#039;s the first thing I have noticed. My overall mental balance and mood has dramatically improved, I don&#039;t feel as off in a chemical imbalanced but more balanced and confident. I don&#039;t ever want to get off this."
