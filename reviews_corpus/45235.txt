"I started taking this medicine only 3 days ago and I already feel like I can tell a difference. I have extreme panic disorder, social anxiety, and just general anxiety. Recently I have been getting panic attacks every night around 9pm, but ever since I started taking this I haven&#039;t had a single one. I know these kind of medicines aren&#039;t supposed to start working for a couple weeks, but I truly feel a difference already. I have tried Lexapro (gained a ton of weight) and Zoloft which was giving me terrible side effects as well so I am hopeful that this medicine will work without causing other problems!"
