"I am 24 
I was experiencing chronic anxiety ، severe muscle tension، fatigue and problem in concentration for about more than year. I did not know exactly the reason for these symptoms.  At first I thought it could be a physical problem in my body. but after some medical tests my doctors suggested me to visit a psychiatric doctor.
So my p doctor recognized my problem as General anxiety disorder and prescribed me cybmalta.
first week only one 30 mg
from second week، two 30 mg per day.
after 2 weeks، it started to work .
after 5week ، excellent...I was almost the man who I was  before anxiety!!!but after a while its performance a little decreased for 2 month. again after the third month ، again it started to getting better slowly.
after 6 month، I am really calm"
