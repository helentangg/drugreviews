"I was put on this for my panic disorder  because i was suffering from panic attacks  while driving because of a bad car wreck I had. Anyways my doctor put me on 10mgs when I took it in the day I was so drowsy and out of it I couldn&#039;t function. So I switched to taking it before bed and I would wake up every night with dizzy spells and heart beating out my chest. It would take a hour for those symptoms to go away and for me to continue my sleep. Then during the day I would have extreme anxiety I couldn&#039;t be behind the wheel of a car without panicking, I couldn&#039;t go out to the store without panicking I was only on it for 10 days the worst 10 days of my life and honestly I feel better now that I&#039;m off this horrible drug"
