"I&#039;ve been on and off Effexor since 2004.  Mostly taken for post partum depression.  I also have BPD and used it for only 6mths. I found that Effexor made me numb.  It makes sense in the beginning but I want to learn how to deal with my emotions and after about six months I start getting withdrawal symptoms because it is no longer working, even though I take as perscribed.  That is what I hate the most the withdrawal symptoms are horrible.  I found working out aggressively like at least 1.5hrs a day gives me better results than this.  It took two weeks for the withdrawal symptoms to subside and I was on the lowest dose."
