"Just started this medication about 5 days ago. The thing with me, I&#039;ve lived a pretty happy life til about 3 years ago.  It has gotten worse over time. I&#039;ve got a medical condition known as Nerofibromatosis. I have a inoperable brain tumor. I recently lost my job cause I couldn&#039;t work because of the pain and short temper I have. I lost my gf about 3 years ago. I would always think someone was out to get me. I would strike out for no reason. Just recently I started having suicidal thoughts and just wanted to give up on life. I would  cry for no reason.  I just wanted to end. Since taking this. It has kinda helped. I get sleepy real quick. I take at night and sleep all night. Hopfully it will continue to help"
