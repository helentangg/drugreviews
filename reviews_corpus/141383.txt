"The first few weeks adjusting to this medicin3 I wasn&#039;t sure if it was for me.....but I stuck with it and glad I did. My anxiety went from on average a rating on a scale from one to ten at an average of 8 down to a 3. Situations that normally would be borderline panic attack are now tolerable and even comfortable. I feel more confident and less anxious. I&#039;m grateful for this medication."
