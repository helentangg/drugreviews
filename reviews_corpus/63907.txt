"29 year old female. Started on 25mg for the first 2-3 weeks. Side effects were very mild (diarrhea and dizziness; also zoned out a lot). After the 1 month mark, I started to feel absolutely amazing. No anxiety anymore. But in the 3rd month I felt like I plateaued. The anxiety and panic attacks started to make a comeback. I upped my dosage to 50mg and it&#039;s helped a bit. I&#039;m currently on 4 months of sertraline. Overall I&#039;ve found it to be a very tolerable drug with little to no side effects."
