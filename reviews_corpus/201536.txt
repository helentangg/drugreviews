"I&#039;ve been on zoloft for almost four weeks now and it&#039;s been a life changer I use to suffer from poor impulse control anxiety and bad depression about two weeks in I started feeling better happier like.the feeling of dread has been removed the demon&#039;s are silenced I feel like I want to live I want to succeed it&#039;s like a dream come true ive suffered from drug addiction in the past and since started zoloft I don&#039;t feel the craving that overwhelming desire to get high the only downside to zoloft. Is the restlessness when.trying to sleep but it&#039;s worth the trade off I started on 50 MG and am now at 100mg per day thank god for zoloft"
