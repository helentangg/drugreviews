"I take 10mg for just 14 days before I get my period.  It definitely helps with my mood and uncontrollable anger.  Before taking this, the silliest things would make me want to scream!  When my husband asked me why I take it, I tell him that I take it in order to extend HIS life expectancy :-)  Enough Said?  Only down side:  Insomnia.  Worth it though."
