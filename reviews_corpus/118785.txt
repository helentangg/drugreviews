"I started taking Zoloft when work stress and other issues got really bad. I had gone to a doctor for cognitive behavioral therapy previously to help with social anxiety, but it didn&#039;t seem to work. So I tried going on Zoloft per a GP suggestion. I first started on 50mg, and the side effects (super drowsy during the day, couldn&#039;t sleep at night, shakiness) were pretty awful for the first couple of weeks, but I stuck with it out of desperation. I am glad I did. My boyfriend says that he sees a huge change. And I don&#039;t feel so very, very awful about everything. I feel like I can see my circular negative thoughts now in a third-party point of view. It hasn&#039;t stopped my negative feelings, but it is helping me not to think about them over and over. Taking 100mg."
