"I am at the end of the 2nd week of the starter pack, last 20 mg pill.  I feel so much better on this medicine. My depression started after some horrible things happened in my family and it paralyzed me.  I didn&#039;t want to do anything anymore.  I wanted to be left alone.  I finally feel happy again.  I have been on Zoloft.  That worked but I gained too much weight. Effexor didn&#039;t really help and Wellbutrin did nothing.  This one made a huge difference and quickly.  I had diarrhea the first day of each new dose but it quickly went away.  No other side effects.  I am also sleeping much better.  The bottom line is, everyone is so completely different.  It is all trial and error."
