"I&#039;ve tried almost every antidepressant. I read the reviews on Lexapro and was prepared for a rough introductory period. I was pleasantly surprised that I felt better than ever...not suicidal, no general anxiety issues, I even felt like I could stand up for myself and not be a doormat. But after the first 6 weeks, I started feeling numb in my heart (you know, no true emotions) and became a cold, mean person. Not to mention the sexual side effects, making it even harder on my marriage. I&#039;ve backed off of it now to try yet another pill, so I&#039;m suicidal and severely anxious and depressed again, but I haven&#039;t felt any other emotions yet."
