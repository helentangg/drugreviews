"I have been taking Pristiq for 3 days now.  Some side effects I&#039;ve had are dry mouth, dilated pupils, trouble sleeping (going to start taking it early morning now) and sweating during the night-time.  I just spoke to my Doctor who said to cut my 50 mg dose pills in half and start taking half in the morning to see if the side effects subside.  The good things are:  I have energy, no more food cravings, no more crying episodes and I  feel more at ease during stressful moments."
