"The first pill very strong so waited till in bed and when the severe pain from shingles hit I took 2nd pill..instant relief. I was so glad I had the medicine and still have the bottle of pills as I never needed another. One pill got me
through the worst pain I had with shingles. I would not have a need for any now but saved in case shingles returned. I think it a tad bit too strong for most
pain that could be treated with a lessor degree of strength. 2 pills used out of whole bottle.  It was expensive but actually just one pill did the job."
