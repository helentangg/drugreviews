"I was given this medicine for anxiety and depression, after a month of taking the 37.5mg this medicine has increased my symptoms of anxiety and depression substantially. Also since I have started taking this medication I have developed some new symptoms such as mania and hallucinations. The pains attacks associated with this medicine are horrifying as well. The most disturbing thing about the drug, to me, is the extremely lifelike and vivid dreams that make you believe you&#039;ve been up all night but in reality you&#039;ve been asleep, this makes waking up very difficult because it&#039;s hard to tell if you&#039;re awake or not. This is an extremely powerful drug, I would discuss other options with your doctor before trying Effexor XR"
