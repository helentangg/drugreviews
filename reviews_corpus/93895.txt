"My doctor started me on this drug after Prozac (which gave me terrible side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, sleeplessness, anxiety) and cipralex/lexapro (which didn&#039;t change my mood at all) both didn&#039;t work for me. I was about four months shy of my 18th birthday, but, according to my doctor, it was alright since I&#039;ve achieved my &quot;adult body&quot;. This medication is, by far, the best one I&#039;ve tried. No side effects at all, and a great improvement to mood. I&#039;m giving it a 9/10 only because it didn&#039;t cheer me up the way Prozac did (despite all the side effects) but that could be due to my lifestyle and not the medication."
