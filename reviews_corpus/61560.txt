"I have tried a lot of different antidepressants in the past few would work but stop working for a while. I even took one where it just simply made me feel like I didn&#039;t want to be bothered with any one.  The sound of someone&#039;s voice made me cringe and if someone touched me I just wanted to ripe their faces completely off. But since I have been on Celexa I feel absolutely excellent and I was taking Abilify with it. With those two combined I would pray with people and counsel with a youth group. Enjoyed the heck out of life much more. But unfortunately I can&#039;t afford abilify any more and I have been trying but no luck. I wish a miracle would come my way. But this is just wishful imagination on my part."
