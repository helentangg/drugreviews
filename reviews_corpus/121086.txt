"The good: tried after 3 years of agoraphobia and relying on diazepam to do even go down the road. 7 months later I&#039;m at university, living a normal life, going to job interviews, socialising with friends, and I&#039;m going abroad (for the first time in 6 years!) next week. Venlafaxine saved my life.

The bad: you have to take it twice a day which is annoying if you&#039;re a disorganised student like me! Also if I forget to take a tablet by even a few hours, ZZZZAP! the brain zaps are so intense it feels like my head is being pounded by a fibrillater, plus dizziness, etc etc. Other notable side affects for me are excessive night sweats,  and dry mouth.

The good outweighs the bad 100% though... I love venlafaxine for how much it&#039;s helped me."
