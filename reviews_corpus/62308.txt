"I started taking this medication about 2 months ago for depression and uncontrollable anger issues, both have ceased. I have mild side effects with this medicine, the most notable would be a persistent sore throat, not sure if anyone else is experiencing this, so your input would be appreciated. I&#039;m thankful that there is actually something out there to help with these issues, so far so good and I highly recommend this for anyone looking for relief of anxiety"
