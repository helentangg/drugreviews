"This medication was/is horrible.  I have been on every medication in the book.  My doctor decided that it would be a good switch from cybalta (120).  I was taking it for major depression/anxiety as well as back pain.  I am in a very advanced anatomy class and my anxiety went up.  This is not unusual for me, as I have a general anxiety disorder....My doctor pushed me to try brintellix to help with my cognition.  I took for two weeks (making my way up to 20 mg), and have been miserable.  Crying, unbelievable anxiety, throwing up, no sex drive.  Today I had enough.  I told my doctor I was done with it.  It has been a terrible experience."
