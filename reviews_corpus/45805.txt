"I have been on Prozac since I was 18, I had huge depression, anxiety, OCD and PST problems. I was so anxious I couldn&#039;t even take the pill for the first month because I thought it was going to kill me! Seven years later I am a different person, I now have a partner and child - before this would have been impossible. I can also deal with stress much better and my rage and anger has also calmed down. The only downsides to this medicine is the weight gain. I have gained 4 stones due to Prozac but I would rather be overweight than suicidal and unable to cope with life."
