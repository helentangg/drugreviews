"10-20mg start pack: Day 2 I had random muscle twitch in my upper outside thigh (gone now).  In addition to depression, I also normally have anxiety, which I believe the medicine is making worse.  My jaws tighten and I feel as if I have non-stop TMJ.  The pain is so sharp in my left jaw, that it wakes me up at night.  Also, intermittent ringing ears.  I regularly have to relax/reposition by jaws due to the pain and tightening.  I have strange stools-not diarrhea but soft and textured. Insomnia is bad.  I can get to sleep quickly, but wake up at the slightest sound and have trouble getting back to sleep.  Constant dull headache.  Just went up to 20 mg and will see what happens. It&#039;s day 8, I&#039;m more anxious and still depressed.  No improvement."
