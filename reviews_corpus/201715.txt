"I am a 44 year old women, I have had anxiety attacks since I was 30 but didn&#039;t know what it was. A year ago I started having panic attacks, I would wake up with them I thought I was going to die. I went to the E.R about three times everything was fine. I was depressed, paranoid, scared to drive, had every panic symptom, went to the doctor and couldn&#039;t stop crying. Thank God they knew what to do. I was put on some medicines at first that made me sicker then having a panic attack. It was horrible I then was put on Zoloft. I started on 25mg and work up to 150mg I slowly started feeling better besides not eating and sleeping but I am now feeling like myself and haven&#039;t had any panic attacks, minor side effects but I feel so much better thanks to the Zoloft."
