"Only side effects I experienced were mild dizziness and nausea whilst starting off on 20mg, about a month later I went onto 40mg and it was the best thing I have ever done for myself... I would recommend this medication to anyone suffering from anxiety. Fluoxetine has been amazing for me and has completely changed my life so far!"
