"I have Fibromyalgia and ME/CFS, as well as depression and anxiety resulting from PTSD. I have been on Zoloft for over 10 years, trying to taper from it for the last 5. I couldn&#039;t get down past 50mg of Zoloft without dreadful side effects, until my doctor suggested I cross taper with Cymbalta. It has made all of the difference in the world. I am now down to 20mg of Zoloft (without any withdrawal symptoms), and up to 30mg of Cymbalta. I noticed within the first few days that my depression and anxiety had subsided almost completely, and my Fibromyalgia pain has measurably decreased. I haven&#039;t had to use as much oxycontin, or klonopin. I look forward to seeing if combining Lyrica will allow me to get off the oxycodone altogether."
