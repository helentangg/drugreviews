"I have pretty bad anxiety, with some depression. Sometimes I get so overwhelmed that I feel like my life is falling apart, and it feels so real. When I take my lexapro, I feel so much better. It&#039;s just a baseline, it doesn&#039;t MAKE me happy, it just allows me to feel like a normal human. I&#039;m most myself when I take my medicine because I can focus on things outside of my own stress and fears. It can make you a little nauseous at first, and I experience some insomnia the first few weeks, but it goes away. SO worth it."
