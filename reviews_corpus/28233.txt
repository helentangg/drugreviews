"Lexapro has worked well for me. My anxiety and depression are about gone.  The first 2 months were pretty bad and I almost quit many times but am glad I didn&#039;t. Side effects included night sweats, tinitus, headaches, insomnia, sexual issues, dizzzyness......  Most of this has resolved now after 3 months. Adding a b complex with folate and omega 3 seems to have helped me. This is a very good drug for anxiety and depression but you&#039;ll need to be very patient, and struggle thru the initial side effects"
