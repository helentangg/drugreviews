"I&#039;ve been in Zoloft for 2 months for depression, anxiety. The reason I don&#039;t give it top grades is because I don&#039;t have anything else to compare it to. Started 1 week on 25mg and then moved to 50mg the first two/three weeks the side effects were the same people describe, headache, tiredness, stomach issues, death thoughts,  lack of appetite, after that  the first sign was no more tears, less anxiety for eating my emotions went away, social anxiety too, fear &amp; death gone too.  Calmness, ability to focus on the now, lower PMS, ability to focus &amp; interact. Some days are still hard but takes less for me to cope with them.  I didn&#039;t know  life could feel this way. (Side effects Lower sex drive &amp; return of big appetite and weight gain)"
