"Helped me out tremendously. Had nausea all the time for the first few weeks, but subsided after about 4 weeks of taking Zoloft. I believe it wasn&#039;t going to work because I have never believed in taking any medications. I am glad I changed my mind.  Zoloft has definitely helped me overcome anxiety."
