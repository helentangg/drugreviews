"Was on Prozac for 6 weeks and it made me gain weight and feel numb and apathetic about every aspect of my life.  I stopped caring about my work performance, stopped wanting to see friends, had low energy yet trouble falling asleep, and had no sex drive whatsoever.  The side effects were more depressing than my life was before."
