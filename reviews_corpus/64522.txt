"I have been on Zoloft for almost two years. It has done wonders for my anxiety. I used to have horrible panic attacks that would make daily things hard and nearly impossible to do. The first week I was on Zoloft it was hard. It makes you feel like crap but after the meds get in your system you start to feel better. I was first on the 25mg but had to get it raised up to 50mg. The side effects do come back when you raise the medication but it helps more than the 25 so I am glad that I raised the dose. One more raise and it should be perfect."
