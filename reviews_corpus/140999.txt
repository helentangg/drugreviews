"Worst med I ever put in my body. Used to take Paxil 20mg on and off for 9 years and dumbly thought I could try another pill only in case I tried to have kids. And wow worse side effects, insomnia, migraines. I was a hypocondriac and this med caused me to have depression and suicidal thoughts! Did NOT suite me at all. But everyone is different."
