"i have taken cymbalta for 5 days now , worked a bit to take some sharp pains away but side effects outweighed the good , i started 30mg     dizzy headaches very upset stomache very gassey burping and farting , i had alot of pain along beltline  from my belly button all the way to the left side of hip , today i passed bright red blood with clots   3 separate times, i had one other time months ago with severe pain same location and passed blood then too , both times i was on cymbalta so today i got googly and found that cymbalta can cause abnormal bleeding in intestines stomach etc and mixing drugs such as aspirin can increase risk of bleeding , it reads bleeding can get as bad as having a life threatning hemoriage , rxlist.com is 1 source"
