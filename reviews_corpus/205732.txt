"First time ever having to take an antidepressant. The first day I took it, I thought I was going crazy because I felt so good. On the third day my daughter noticed I was more energetic. I&#039;m about 2 weeks into it now, and feel great. I&#039;m able to move about and not be so sluggish. I keep forgetting it in the morning and have been taking it late afternoon and it doesn&#039;t seem to affect my sleep. Actually I have been able to go to sleep before midnight when I had been going to sleep at least 2 or 3 in the morning. I can lead a more normal life because I&#039;m not sleeping until most of the morning is gone and feel so much more energy! Usually as soon as something bothered me, I&#039;d go down, but now I&#039;m able to keep going. Loving this."
