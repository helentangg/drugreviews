"I was on Effexor XR for almost a year. I started out on 75 mg a day, and it slowly progressed to 300 mg per day. I was 16, and weighed 105 pounds, while my 300  lb grandfather was only on 75 mg. While it helped with the depression (no suicidal ideas, not sleeping all day, etc.) it aggravated my moods. I had manic episodes that I would not remember, hallucinations, trouble sleeping, and when I did get depressed, it was very severe. The worst part was the withdrawal. It made me feel like I had the flu, and had been hit by a train. I ended up weaning myself off of it, with the help of 25 mg of Benadryl twice a day (it cut down on the nausea). I am now about to start Cymbalta, and I hope that it is a better experience."
