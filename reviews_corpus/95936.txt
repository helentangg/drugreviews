"Over the last couple of years, all of the stress from moving far away from my family and having a stressful job got to me.  I started to experience panic and anxiety every now and again, to a build up of where I couldn&#039;t function or leave the house.  I was first put on Lexapro, and I had a terrible experience and thought I was going to die.  I finally made it back home to my old family doctor who decided to to try me on Zoloft, first at 25mg for a week and then 50 mg.  The first 3-4 weeks I noticed absolutely no change, and was taking Klonopin and anti-nausea meds to survive.  Then about 5 weeks in I noticed a profound difference.  I was my normal self!  I could go out in public, function, and fight off the panic/anxiety.  So happy now!"
