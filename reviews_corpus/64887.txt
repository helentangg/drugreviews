"So glad I decided to try Zoloft after suffering with depression and anxiety after my husbands passing. I am calmer and feel somewhat happy. I&#039;m on 50mg 
There&#039;s no need to suffer everyday.  Life doesn&#039;t have to be so painful   Do yourself a favor and try it. It might just take some of that pain away. It&#039;s definitely worth a try"
