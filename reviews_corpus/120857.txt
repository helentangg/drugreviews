"I&#039;ve only been on this drug for four days.  Before this, I was on 40mg Celexa, which did not help much with my social anxiety but did help a little with my depression.  

Last week, I talked to my doctor about switching my medication because my depression was worse.  She switched me to 150 mg of Venlafaxine.  It has already helped me tremendously, and I hope it continues to get better in time.

Also, I haven&#039;t suffered from any side effects except fo a little constipation, which is severe."
