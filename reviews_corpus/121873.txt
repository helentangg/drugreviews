"I&#039;ll start by telling you that I tried both Celexa and Lexapro. Celexa did fairly well, but Lexapro...that&#039;s a story for another time. I went to my doctor and told her I couldn&#039;t do Lexapro anymore. She prescribed me venlafaxine. In all honesty, I could tell a difference within the first few days. My panic attacks were fewer and further between, and I felt the dark cloud lifting. I&#039;ve been on it for approximately two months now and haven&#039;t had any crazy side effects like I did with the other SSRIs. I suppose I&#039;m still in the trial phase but I have no reason to dislike it yet. A miracle pill? Well, maybe.
That&#039;s not to say that I don&#039;t get depressed again every now and then, but I&#039;m generally content."
