"I got into a burnout and had anxiety, depressive and obsessive thoughts. I couldn&#039;t sleep anymore. My Doctor initially prescribed Paxil but the side effects were horrible so she switched me to Lexapro. My symptoms gradually went away over a month. The only side effect I had was mild weight gain which I could not sweat off until I quit the medication.

I stayed on Lexapro for just over a year while I also did CBT. I gradually quit over a 6-wk period with no withdrawal symptom.

Lexapro litteraly saved my job, relationship and my sanity. I only have good comments to say about this drug."
