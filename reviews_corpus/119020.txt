"I&#039;ve been on Zoloft (generic) for a few weeks now. I&#039;m on a low dose (25mg) to get me started. I haven&#039;t noticed much of a lift in my mood, in fact I tend to get sad more easily, but I have fewer headaches, which used to be a big problem for me. Also I&#039;ve noticed it makes me really tired so I take it at night to help me sleep."
