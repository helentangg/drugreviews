"This medicine really seems to help me a bit, I don&#039;t much have an appetite (but I never did anyway), it calmed me down enough to think. I&#039;ve been on it for almost a week and for a few days my terrible nightmares stopped, but now my dreams are back but they&#039;re just weird now. I had nausea for the first 4 days, not that&#039;s gone. This medicine has some good qualities, but for me, 4 days after starting to take it I developed a rash on my neck in reaction to the medicine. 

Don&#039;t let that scare you though. Only 7% of people will have this effect according to a couple of articles I&#039;ve read about it. Anti-itch cream keeps it from bothering me, but I&#039;m planning to switch to Celexa soon."
