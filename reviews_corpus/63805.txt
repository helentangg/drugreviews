"I thought I would share today my experience with zoloft. 2 months ago I was the anxious one on here reading all the reviews on medications, every one and there was positive and negatives. So worried about taking an &quot;antidepressant&quot;. I suffered daily with SEVERE anxiety and panic attacks to where I would have a panic attack sometimes for a few hours. It was awful. And because I felt like that so often I would say I had mild depression. Just hopeless.  Could anything help my anxiety ? This medicine has changed my life for the better. I started at 25mg and still felt bad, no improvement even after 5 weeks. My doctor upped me to 50mg and within a week I felt 100x better. I had no side effects other than 2/3 headaches. My advice to you, try it."
