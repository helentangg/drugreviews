"After one of the worst years of my life I developed anxiety, was prescribed Endep 25mg, progressed to 50mg then 100mg. Side effects were full on and included but were not limited to dizziness, short term memory loss, black outs (momentary but scary), nightmares, indigestion, incredible tiredness (cloudy head, fuzziness), dry mouth and one of the deepest most horrible depressive states I have ever been in which included suicide thoughts , but hey, I didn&#039;t have anxiety! THIS IS A WARNING, if you develop suicidal thoughts while taking this drug see a doctor immediately!"
