"After trying Zoloft, Effexor and Lexapro, we tried Cymbalta.  The worst experience I have ever had with a drug to treat my MDD.  I was on it for ONE NIGHT. Literally, just one night. I took it that night and woke up about 6am the next morning or thoughts of cutting off my hand. I heard a voice in my head telling me my hand was bad. Telling me that I needed to cut it off. I stuck my hand under my pillow, and laid there staring at the wall. I hoped the voices would go away. I eventually fell back asleep. Later that day I took the medicine to my psychiatrist and left it on her desk. I told her, &quot;here you take this crazy making drug&quot;. I&#039;m depressed, but not crazy."
