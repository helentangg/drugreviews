"Starting of i was hesitant because nothing really happened i just felt blah the first two days on 75mg, than i started feeling the posotive effects! It was amazing, i havent felt like this ever before on an antidepressant! Im now on 150mg and just livin life depression free. If you have tried prozac, celexa, brintellix, and they havent worked for you give this a shot... Sometimes the risk is worth it!"
