"I am a young and small person who was in search for a medication to control my depression but mostly my anxiety and OCD tendencies. I had tried Lexapro before also mixed with Buspar but it never seemed to fully do the trick; it felt like I was taking a pill and not getting much from it. Prozac has caused maybe a 5 lb fluctuation in my weight and it did decrease my sex drive for about the first 6 to 8 months but I feel that is just the amount of time necessary to get used to the new drug. This has been the only effective solution to my illness."
