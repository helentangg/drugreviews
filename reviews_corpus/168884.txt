"After taking Viibryd for almost three months I can say that I feel better, my depression isn&#039;t as bad. It is a little better, but I feel like it could be even better. I don&#039;t know if I should talk to my doctor about it. I take 40 mg a day which I believe is the highest recommended dose. I have chronic pain (and surgery) issues and I am scared of taking a supplementary medication because of side effects. I can say that I have experienced NO side effects. I take mine in the morning and am perfectly able to take it with or without food. Viibryd has definitely helped me, but I think I need some more help."
