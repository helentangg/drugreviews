"I have been on many anti-depressant medication for years. The last prescription was mirtazapine. Weight gain was ridiculous. My new doctor has prescribed 5 milligrams for the first two weeks then increase to 10 milligrams. After the first week I feel amazing I&#039;ve had no side effects. I want to get out of bed, get dressed. Open the window shade for sunshine. I have not felt this good in a very long time. Two thumbs up kudos to my new doctor for prescribing this amazing antidepressant"
