"I have been on this medicine for 5 weeks . It&#039;s been a bit of an adjustment but now that it has kicked in I feel great. No more anxiety or panic attacks. I started out at 5mg then went to 7.5 and now I am at 10mg which seems to be the best dose for me. The first 1-2 weeks was the hardest. Loss of appetite and increased anxiety.  Glad I gave it a few weeks to work because now I feel great."
