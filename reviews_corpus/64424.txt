"I recently started zoloft [literally 3 days ago] 50mg daily, and I already am feeling level headed, less anxious and just simply good. 
After months of feeling suicidal, paranoid, depressed, and hopeless around the time of my menstrual cycle , it&#039;s helping. I truly believe this is not a placebo affect- as I am horribly negative around my menstrual cycle, I physically and mentally feel a change [more focus towards tasks and not current worries and willing to get up and go!] The PA i see said I could either take zoloft 3 weeks out of the month or I could take it daily for the whole month. I chose daily dosing. I&#039;m so glad I made the leap to actually talk to someone and get a diagnosis of PMDD"
