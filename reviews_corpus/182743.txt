"After 6 years, I finally tried to talk to my doctor about side effects her reply was that there was nothing wrong with the medications, I complained to much. I started taking myself off of some of them myself. Fortunately, maybe, she had a family problem that she took leave to deal with. By this time, I had taken myself off of 70% of opiate pain killers. I told the doctor that I wanted to stop the Cymbalta. His response was no problem. I was taking two 30mg, his instruction was stop taking one for a week then stop the other. Five days later I was calling saying that was going to work. I was then prescribed two  20 mg and started doing what I found on the internet. A month later, things were better but I swing back and forth with issues come and go.

The doctor still says they haven&#039;t had issues with other patients. Maybe the doctors don&#039;t talk to their patients? They definitely don&#039;t read anything about the drugs that they prescribe."
