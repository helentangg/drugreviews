"Visual migraines since Junior High.  Incredible pain following the event including omitting.  No one could help..internal medicine doctors, ophthalmologists, neurologists.  At age 32, a foot doctor tells me that I am a victim of visual migraines and suggested nortriptyline.  Went to neurologist for medicine.  I am on 50mg taken each night before bed.  Visual effects still occur intermittently but migraine is aborted.  Still have headache for three days but the medicine keeps me from being incapacitated for days.  I am now 50 years old and could not live without it. I have dry mouth, redness of skin, sensitive to sun and problems urinating at times but these issues are nothing compared to what I lived with for 20 years.  I highly recommend the product!"
