"I took Viibryd and it made me feel worse than before! I took it for about 2 months. Everything seemed fine but after 2 months I felt these feelings of low-self esteem (Because of another issue but the Viibryd made the problem seem 20 times worse) and overall terrible. I was on Paxil before and I think I was better off still on that! I take Effexor now and feel much better. Viibryd was not for me."
