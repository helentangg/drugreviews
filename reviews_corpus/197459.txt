"Paxil saved my life.  I was depressed and could not climb out.  Tried Effexor but it made my heart beat rapidly and made me really nervous.  Paxil has been amazing.  I feel like a regular person.  I have highs and lows, but the lows aren&#039;t as low as they used to be... and they only occur when there is a real reason to be sad.  The Bad: the withdrawal symptoms are horrible!  I didn&#039;t try to get off Paxil, but I forgot it once on a vacation trip.  Got very light headed, dizzy, and I had the &quot;zaps.&quot;  It was like being shocked at random moments.  I&#039;ll probably never get off Paxil... but it is worth it.  My quality of life improved in the last 3 years and it is worth any long term effect this drug has on me."
