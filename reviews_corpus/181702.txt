"Very helpful for this medicine for several uses. Good for anxiety. Long acting medicine allows for various dosing regimes. About as effective for the given individual as the next SSRI so don&#039;t be afraid to try this.  Was good for me without side effects at the starting dose. Side effects did show up at a higher dose though. Overall a good medicine. "
