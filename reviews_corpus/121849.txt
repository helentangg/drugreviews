"If I was not on Effexor (in combination with Lithium &amp; Seroquel), truthfully, I would not be here to write this.  With investigation by my psychiatrist into  my medical records, we identified I have been bipolar for 40 years.  Many of them I was not treated, even though I spent three different times in a &quot;mental&quot; facility.  The only identification for me was that I was a difficult and troubled person.  When I finally met the psychiatrist I have today, with his help and his innate understanding of what bipolar is, it only took 3 or 4 different prescriptions to finally arrive at Effexor giving me the best overall help.  As I mentioned earlier, this prescription has truly been a life saver.  No bothersome side effects."
