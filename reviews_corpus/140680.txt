"Now 10 days taking escitalopram drops (5 drops daily = 5mg). The severe headache lasted 2 days from the start. No other side effects noted. Still early days and feeling positive. I still take xanax in the evenings and lowered the dose to.  The side effects were nasty at the start and enough to put you off taking the meds. Just keep going and drink plenty of water to. These meds need time for the body to adjust.  Don&#039;t give in, keep going."
