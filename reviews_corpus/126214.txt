"Keeping a long story short, I have been on almost all the SSRIs and SNRIs and even a few atypical&#039;s out there with SOME relief but I never where I wanted to be. I stopped all medicines last June and did ok until mid November when I relapsed into depression again. My doc told me to try Viibryd and reluctantly I did. This medicine by far is the best one I have been on. There were some stomach issues for the first 3 weeks or so and I have to take a very small dose of trazodone at bedtime to combat the insomnia side effect. BUT I have not felt this good in years. I feel happy and motivated again and I sleep well. I would recommend this to anyone who has had trouble finding a good antidepressant that works."
