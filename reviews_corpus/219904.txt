"I have had sleep issues for a long time. Strong sleep medicines left me groggy and really out of it. This year, when anxiety issues caused some serious sleep problems, my doctor prescribed 25 mg of amitriptyline, and my pharmacist said to start with 10 mg the first couple nights. It has worked well, returned me to my normal sleep patterns, and now I occasionally take 5 mg if I have had a difficult or emotion-laden day. Works very well for me."
