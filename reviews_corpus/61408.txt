"A month ago I started having really bad anxiety, to the point I would lie in bed all day feeling suicidal. I couldn&#039;t eat (I lost 1 stone in 2 weeks), I couldn&#039;t sleep without having a panic attack that woke me up every hour and I was terrified this was going to be my life from now on. I was signed off work sick but had bills to pay, which added to the stress and anxiety I had. I had thoughts of ending my own life because I felt that hopeless and down and was worried I would never snap out of it. The worse symptom was the derealization. After 3 awful weeks of adjusting to 20mg citalopram, I&#039;m feeling SO much better already. Please stick with this medication, I feel like I&#039;ve got my life back.."
