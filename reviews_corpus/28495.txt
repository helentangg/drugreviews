"I have taken Lexapro 20 mg for many years for depression and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Only side effects (male) are unable to achieve orgasm, which can be frustrating if you let it. But, I tried Viibryd which was to &quot;improve&quot; Lexapro (no sexual side effects and no weight gain - which I never had weight gain anyway). Viibryd was awful. Did not help depression OR anxiety, and I was ravenously hungry. I insisted on going back on Lexapro. It is tried and true for me. Stick with it; it takes 6-8 weeks to be fully effective. "
