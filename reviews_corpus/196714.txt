"After suffering for years with untreated PTSD the symptoms kept getting worse. Finally talked with my Dr. about it. Started me on Paxil 20 mg for a couple of months and then increased to 30 mg. I am not &quot;cured&quot;, but my anxiety has drastically decreased. I feel almost normal. Paxil has been a God send for me."
