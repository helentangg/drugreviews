"I was suffering from generalized anxiety disorder with some panic.  It was a miserable situation and although I gutted it out for many years, I finally decided to try meds.  My doctor prescribed Prozac, 10 mg initially.  I&#039;m not going to lie, those first couple of weeks were rough.  It actually made me MORE anxious and pretty jittery. Sleep was not restful. But then just about the time I was going to give up (2-3 weeks into it) and try something else, I started feeling better.  Eventually, I felt a LOT better.  I now take 20 mg/daily and I feel like I got my life back.  I don&#039;t think I realized how small my life had become until the anxiety abated.  For someone who can gut out the initial few weeks, it is so worth it."
