"The generic venlafaxine is not comparable to EFFEXOR XR at all . You have to take them 1 every so many hours you have to figure it out to take during your waking hours. Therefore you crash daily and more than once a day. The bad news is my insurance won&#039;t pay for the EFFEXOR I have to pay out of pocket for it."
