"I&#039;ve been taking Venlafaxine XR (the generic version of Effexor XR) for exactly one month now and I can honestly say that I haven&#039;t felt this normal in a long, long time. I started out taking 37.5 mg for seven days, and then my dose was increased to 75 mg where it has thus far remained.  Upon start up I had no adverse side effects other than fatigue.  I take my pill every night with dinner, and although I do have trouble sleeping at times, it is not consistent.  I was also given a prescription for 0.5 mg lorazepam as a &quot;bridging&quot; medication to take only when needed.  Overall I would recommend Venlafaxine.  Don&#039;t believe all the scary things you read about it. I was scared too but quite honestly I feel it has improved my life."
