"I&#039;m an 18 year old female who used to take Lexapro for anxiety/depression (20 mg) but went off of it for a couple years. Recently and for the first time I had a severe panic attack which landed me in the hospital, this happened two nights in a row. The doctor diagnosed me with Panic Disorder and Anxiety and prescribed me 10 mg of Lexapro daily and 5 mg of Xanax to take as needed. I took 10 mg of Lexapro the first morning but upped the dosage to 20 mg the following day. I&#039;m on day 5 now and although the side effects (dizziness, loss of appetite, stomachache, lack of sex drive) I have noticed a significant improvement in my anxiety. I am only on day 5 so of course it&#039;ll take some time to fully see the effects."
