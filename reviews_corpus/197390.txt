"I took paroxetine (Paxil) for 2 months.  It took a while to feel any effect from it. It did help regulate my moods a little bit, but after a month and a half it started giving me stomach pains and feelings of hopelessness and suicide.  I am still experiencing the effects of not taking it anymore. It&#039;s been about a week since I quit.  I was going to taper the dosage but it just made me too sick.  I am sure this medicine is great for others but my body just did not agree with it."
