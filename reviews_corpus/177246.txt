"My doctor prescribed me Duloxetine 30mg for depression/anxiety and I really wanted to like it, but I just can&#039;t. I took this drug for just 2 days and after that, I had to stop (starting today). After taking this horrible drug, my eyes has become sensitive to light, feels badly strained. I also get blurry vision sometimes, but worst of all, I woke up this morning with dry blood in my right eye. It wasn&#039;t a lot, but it was enough to force me to quit this drug. 

I regret ever taking this drug. I&#039;ve had healthy eyes my entire life and I&#039;m really hoping these symptoms go away soon. I will never touch this drug again and I would never recommend it to anyone. I refuse to take any drug that messes with your eyes."
