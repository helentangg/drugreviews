"I&#039;ve been on desvenlafaxine actavis for over 2 years now for anxiety/anger and depression i was seeing a psychologist for the first three months of having the drug an experienced minimal side effects a little dizziness here and there. Although I dont feel any different I&#039;m not quick to lose my temper anymore and I dont stew on things that have made me very angry in the past"
