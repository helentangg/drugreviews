"Have been on Cymbalta for 4 days.. My pain was severe--doctor put me on methotraxate and Cymbalta, and Ultram. I feel fairly good today...the pain in my arms went from a 10 to a 3. I will continue it for 8 days, then I see dr. again. So, maybe this one will work. I also have the itchy body and a little dizzy, no sickness today."
