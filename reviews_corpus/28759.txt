"I&#039;m a 48 year old female.  I&#039;ve been on Lexapro for around a year due to panic attacks. Unable to function, I couldn&#039;t breathe, or drive myself to and from work without having an attack. My Doctor put me on 10 mg Lexapro, and all of that stopped.  Have not had a problem with that since. I was absolutely exhausted and numb, though.  I have also gained around 20 pounds, and no libido at all.  My Doctor cut me down to 5 mg, and I took myself down after a couple of weeks to none.  Probably not the smartest move.  Now have dizziness to the extreme and some headaches, but I&#039;m determined to get drug free if possible."
