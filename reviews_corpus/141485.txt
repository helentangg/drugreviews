"Took 10mg last night for the first time.  Felt drowsy after an hour.  Thought this was a good thing because I have trouble sleeping, but when I went to bed and started my usual worries, my heart started pounding in my throat and I felt like I couldn&#039;t breath deep enough.  It was a struggle to sleep all night and woke up from weird dreams at 3am and was WIDE awake.  It is now almost 11 and I feel like I am trembling internally.  I will not be continuing this medication.  I wonder if it is because it is a generic?  I have heard patients have more issue with generics."
