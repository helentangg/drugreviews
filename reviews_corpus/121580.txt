"I been on this medicine since 6 years, I love it. Never  thought I was going to get better especially after my last pregnancy, oh my gosh couldn&#039;t even get out of the house, but than my doctor introduced me to this amazing pill, 150 mg a day. That&#039;s all I needed, and bang ....my life was like before."
