"I was told to take Effexor Rx at the age of 14/15 when I responded horrible to other anti-depressants.  I am now 19 and am extremely satisfied with the results of this drug.  I rated it a 8 out of 10 because the dosage can be tricky.  GO TO A MEDICAL DOCTOR when confused about dosage regarding season changes, how it interacts with other drugs, or when discontinuing use! I have read numerous blogs about the horrible withdrawal effects - tell a medical doctor. They know how to fix this."
