"This medicine did help to take the edge off slightly, but it was certainly not worth the 30 pound weight gain! Despite being active and eating in moderation the weight wouldn&#039;t budge until after 3 months of stopping this medicine. 
I&#039;ve had to resort to Klonopin even though it&#039;s in the benzo class...better results with no sexual side effects or weight gain. Good luck everyone!"
