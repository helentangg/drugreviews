"I just started Lexapro a week and a half ago.  I noticed results almost immediately.  The only side effect I encountered was a slight light-headed feeling that has since subsided for the most part.  I have felt like hell and have been struggling with anxiety/depression for the past six years without medication.  This stuff has literally saved my life.  I feel like my old self again.  My only regret is that I didn&#039;t try it sooner."
