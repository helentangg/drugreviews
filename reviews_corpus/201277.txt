"After having several panic attacks over a 12mth period I was prescribed Zoloft. I had no idea that it would also help with so many other problems which I just thought were variations of &quot;normal.&quot; I started on 25mg in the morning but found it made me feel tired so I changed to taking it before bed. Miraculously I was able to fall asleep within a few minutes instead of the usual 30 to 60 minutes. I also stayed asleep through the night, rarely waking but easily returning to sleep when I did. I felt less agitated and irritated by what now seems like fairly trivial things. Big problems in life still exist but they do not dominate my mind every waking moment. I no longer feel embarrassed in social situations and just feel generally content."
