"I have been on lexapro for 7 months and it has helped me greatly! I was on Paxil previously and gained 20kg so asked to change medication. Lexapro has stopped the panic attacks and made me feel more confident, I can now go to the shops on my own, drive places on my own and hang out with friends without thinking the worse will happen. Only thing is I&#039;ve gained about 8kg and I cannot lose the weight. I had no side effects what so ever when I started, maybe it&#039;s because I was previously on Paxil, but I didn&#039;t have any side effects apart from weight gain with that either. So if you are feeling nervous about starting this medication because of the side effects don&#039;t be, you might be one of the lucky ones who don&#039;t get side effects."
