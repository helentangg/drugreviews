"I have only been on this medication for about a month, and I&#039;ve felt the best I&#039;ve felt in over two years. I feel my self esteem has increased, as well as toleration of speaking to people and being in crowds. Only thing is that my appetite has gone up somewhat, and I&#039;ve gained a little weight. But that is only a small price to pay for a happier life."
