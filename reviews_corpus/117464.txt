"To those of you who are having nightmares, they will go away. I had them so bad but it worked so well for the low back neuropathy I was finally able to walk again. My back kills me.  I take 30 MG throughout the day now.  Taking it with tramadol decreases the effectiveness of the drug.   Nortryptilline is a tricyclic antidepressant.  It blocks the receptors in the cerebellum so pain signals cannot be received.  This is not FDA approved because being an antidepressant when one is  it depressed can be very risky and cause serious side effects.  For those of you who are waking up on this medication, you could be low on serotonin and those that are falling asleep you could have too much.  It will also make you very constipated.  Be careful."
