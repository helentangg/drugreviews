"After coming off Prozac in June I started to have panic attacks, was stressed all the time and would worry so much about the smallest things. I had to go off work sick due to the panic attacks, fear and depression. I literally did not want to live, I have been on paroxetine 20mg for 8 weeks and I have got my life back. I am my happy self again, panic attacks have stopped, and I feel so much calmer. It has literally saved me. This is the best antidepressant for me (and I have tried several in the past) side effects include sleepiness (take more naps) and lack of orgasm but I&#039;m so content I don&#039;t even care! Good luck, and give it a try. "
