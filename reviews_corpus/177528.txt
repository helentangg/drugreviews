"I was diagnosed with major depression and anxiety almost 20 years ago. Before I was on Cymbalta, I was on Zoloft for about 8 years and it had the dreaded developed tolerance effect (it gradually stopped working). I was then put on Cymbalta, which worked great for about another 8 years. Then the break-through symptoms started again, so my doctor suggested I go up (from 60 mg/day) to 90 mg a day. And although this worked great for managing the anger, irritability and anxiety, I completely lost my libido and any ability whatsoever to have an orgasm. I am back down to 70 mg/day and having to augment with Buspar. Still having anger and irritability, however."
