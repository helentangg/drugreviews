"I have gone through a lot these last 5 months from changing careers and moving and having two deaths in my family. I was having bad crying jags and feeling really down. My anxiety was very high. I have been on this medication for about 4 days now and I feel a sense of peace and all my mind-chatter has left. I know the full dose has not kicked in yet so I&#039;m hoping to feel better and better. I was totally against taking anything but sometimes you just need that extra push. In the beginning I did feel very tired but that has lifted. I feel clear headed and plan to stay on this for a little just to get back to normal."
