"I&#039;ve been on SSRIs for six years now. My old one citolopram stopped working so switched to parox about four years ago. At first loved it but the last year side effects are really bad. I have tremors (body jerks) vivid nightmares and suicidal thoughts. I went back to doctor and she upped my dose to 30mg from 20. I do drink once a week heavily but I&#039;m 24 and I don&#039;t know how to get around this when its so much part of my culture. Don&#039;t know what to do over it still get side effects when don&#039;t drink but am scared of changing meds cos of withdrawals of previous SSRI"
