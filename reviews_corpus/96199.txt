"I have always suffered from depression, but got panic disorder after I broke up with my fiance of 3 years. During that time it was hell. I couldn&#039;t drive or go out alone in fear that I would hurt myself or others out of impulse. 

I was prescribed citalopram initially and it made things worse. Strangely my mom is on citalopram and copes really well (she has depression without anxiety). My psychiatrist recommended a switch to Zoloft and everything improved drastically. My symptoms of anxiety subsided dramatically and I can now continue with my life as normal. I still get mild panic attacks, but very rarely or when I get very upset. I would definitely give Zoloft a thumbs up, but it should be clear that these medicines affect every person differently."
