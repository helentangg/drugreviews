"I&#039;ve only been taking citalopram for a few weeks now. My Doctor prescribed it because it comes in a generic form. I was taking Lexapro and it worked well. Unfortunately, my insurance only covered a small portion of the cost and Lexapro doesn&#039;t come in a generic form.

Celexa seems to work fine so far. No significant difference from the Lexapro except it seems a bit more difficult falling asleep."
