"I took 75 mg for 3 weeks and it didn&#039;t really move the needle for my depression.  I thought around day 3 I felt a little better, but after that it was pretty much back to being depressed as I had been before.  I did feel like I was less easily angered by things, which was nice.  It did not help my social anxiety very much or at all. 

Side effects were not too bad.  A little drowsiness the first few days.  Some ringing in the ears.  Decreased libido the first couple of weeks.

The doctor has changed me over to Cymbalta, so we&#039;ll see if that works any better.  I had high hopes for Zoloft, but I guess it just didn&#039;t work for me."
