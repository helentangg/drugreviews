"I started using Zoloft about 2 months ago for stress and anxiety. I have a teenager and we fought constantly, I would fly off at him for back talking and we were both miserable. Since taking Zoloft we get along so much better and I am not as stressed. I also have a touch of OCD, I was always cleaning and stressing about everything in the house not being like it should, now I am not bothered if something is out of place or not cleaned. I spend time with my 2 kids instead of cleaning house. I am taking 50mg and I love it. My sex drive hasn&#039;t been affected, my appetite decreased for about 2 weeks but it&#039;s okay now. I recommend this medication to anyone who feels they need something to help with stress."
