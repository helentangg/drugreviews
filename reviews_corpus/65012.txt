"This medication takes a while to work, you also need to be on the correct dosage! Am on 200mgs and have just started to feel more normal! I have been on this medicine 7 weeks, 2 weeks at 200mgs! My therapist also said if you are suffering with anxiety (health OCD) which I&#039;d never experienced before , dark thoughts 200 mgs is most effective being on less doesn&#039;t really work."
