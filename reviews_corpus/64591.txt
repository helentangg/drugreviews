"Sertraline has actually filled in the gaps where Citalopram failed. However, bowel movements have become a tentative almost ambivalent arrangement but so far that is the worst of the side effects for me personally. Although I do have dark days, the dogs don&#039;t bark quite so loudly or for so long. Sertraline has given me the ability to stop thinking about the things I am troubled by and focus on what I want to do and what I want to be with perspicacity and belief in myself and to accept the fact that it&#039;s okay to have such medication to treat depression in exactly the same way that it is okay to have HRT for menopause or insulin to treat diabetes. Stick with it."
