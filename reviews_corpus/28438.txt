"I never thought I would take something like this.  About 9 months ago my marriage was rapidly falling apart after over two decades.  My whole life was filled with general social anxiety which I&#039;d more or less learned to tolerate through behavior self-control.  My wife insisted I try therapy, but that was a general waste of valuable time until I brought up the subject of taking medicines (I was getting desperate).  My therapist wend ahead and let me try Lexapro.  It took several weeks for my body to stabilize and get used to the changes (including mental). It&#039;s the best decision I&#039;ve made in my life.  Marriage is better than ever and my anxieties are history."
