"Hi all I&#039;ve been on sertraline for just over 7 weeks started out on 25mg then 50mg then worked my way up to 100mg. I had 
every side affect going BUT I did not give up I suffered from severe anxiety, could not leave the house, my husband had to take time off work to look after me, BUT Now I am nearly back to my old self, going out, if you are just starting out on sertraline please please give it time to work and hold on in there IT WILL GET BETTER ."
