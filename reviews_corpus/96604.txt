"Zoloft&#039;s been a life saver for me. I&#039;ve been stable for over ten years.  I&#039;ve had to have my dose adjusted but that&#039;s part of life. It hasn&#039;t made me manic, knock on wood. My friends and family are a huge support. I take my medicines as directed, and I don&#039;t use alcohol or other drugs. No serious side effects. My doctor&#039;s also very careful. I get upped or lowered slowly and he watches me closely. The only hard time with Zoloft was running out. I did get withdrawls."
