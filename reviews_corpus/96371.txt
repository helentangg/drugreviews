"I have had great success with Zoloft after only taking it for 1 week. I suffer from OCD and mainly intrusive and compulsive thoughts....I dealt with them for a long time (I&#039;m only 18) but I&#039;m feeling the effects of Zoloft and already it&#039;s great. I had side effects after the 1st pill (upset stomach, headache) but that was only for 24 hours after that and still to this day the only side effects I&#039;m having is excessive yawning and a weird jaw feeling, which feels kinda cool."
