"I&#039;m a 17 year old female. I&#039;m in my first semester of college. I&#039;ve had depression since about 13/14 and I&#039;ve always had anxiety. Unfortunately, my anxiety became intolerable once I started college. I&#039;ve been on Zoloft for a week and a half. The first week I took 25 mg, now I&#039;m up to 50 mg. I&#039;ve only had one panic attack since starting. I feel way more relaxed. As for the depression, I used to sit around all day just thinking about how much I hate life. I haven&#039;t been doing this anymore since I started on Zoloft. I&#039;m hoping Zoloft will do even more for me after a few more weeks. I&#039;m finally looking forward to the future with hope."
