Multiple trips to the dentist, root canals, extractions, teeth fillings removed and replaced with porcelain ones. Septoplasty by ENT specialist. Numerous doses of Antibiotics and tramadol for pain. I told all this to a doctor that listened and he turned to my and said &quot;You have trigeminal neuralgia&quot;. I was given Gabapentin, which didn&#039;t work.
