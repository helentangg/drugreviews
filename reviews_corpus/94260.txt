"Update: Now 2 months in, and feeling better than I have in 10  yrs. I am now on 20mg. I feel really calm, like I can breathe again. On 10mg it took less effort to hold off the anxiety/panic attacks. At 20mg I don&#039;t have the background anxiety at all, and no panic attacks (vs one every 2-3 days). I no longer have insomnia. I&#039;m optimistic and becoming more actively interested in life. I smile a lot more and socialize. No jitters or side effects. No mania or agitation. Thinking clearer, feeling great, thinking about working in the future, and reconsidering my decision to not have children due to mental health issues."
