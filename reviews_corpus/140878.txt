"I posted previously about my depression due to my father passing and I&#039;ve been on 20mg for about 4 months and it helped a little bit for a while but now my depression is as bad as it was before starting the medication. I&#039;m posting this because my previous post had it rated as an 8/10 but I thought I rated it as a 4/10. The side effects when first starting were horrible, I had extreme nausea and massive headaches for the first 3-5 days. It also makes me feel exhausted all the time no matter how much sleep I get."
