"So far I&#039;m happy with the Lexapro I had the yawning, drowsy in the afternoons one night consisted of the jitters but half a 5mg valium had me soon settled, and so far only needed it the once. I still don&#039;t have much of an appetite at the moment so that&#039;s the worst of it all so far fingers crossed it stays that way. I have noticed my anxiety getting better slowly it&#039;s only been 1 week on 5mg I don&#039;t want to get my hopes up but I guess that&#039;s my anxiety way of thinking kicking in."
