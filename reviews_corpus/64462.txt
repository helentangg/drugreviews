"I had some anxiety in college, then graduated, and the anxiety stayed. I used medication as my last resort, and after my doctor decided taking clonazepam everyday wasn&#039;t cutting it- I went on Zoloft.  I expressed my concern about the weight gain aspect of this drug, and my doctor told me this was weight neutral....HA. a year later and I am 25 pounds heavier despite strict diet and exercise. The drug does wonders for anxiety, but I cannot deal with the weight. I am now considered obese. I&#039;ve tried everything, and the only thing that seems to work is simply not eating (which obviously isn&#039;t practical). I am in the process of getting off this drug."
