"My experience with Sertraline has been an interesting one. It started off badly. One of the side effects seems to be enhanced anxiety levels. I also became increasingly depressed and struggled communicating at times. I had disturbed sleep patterns and constantly racing negative thoughts. It was tough. I had read up on the subject though and understood that this was only temporary and battled through it. There were times that I nearly gave up. Times when it all seemed too much. Slowly, but surely, things started to improve. The first two weeks were hell, the third week became hellish and the fourth less so. After 6 weeks my smile had returned, I was able to tackle the world and confidence began to flow. It&#039;s been a life changer / saver."
