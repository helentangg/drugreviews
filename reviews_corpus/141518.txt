"Day 5 today, my doctor prescribed me this for mild panic attacks I have when at work. So far it has not been to bad, slight headaches and I am finding I am having trouble with my sleep. Its either a broken sleep, waking up a lot or sleeping but feeling like I&#039;m not asleep (if that makes sense). However I have found that it has slightly worked so far, have had my thoughts of stopping because of the sleeping thing, but will keep at it after reading the reviews, seems to work for most people."
