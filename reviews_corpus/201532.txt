"I primary start taking Zoloft for panic attacks. But I also suffer from PMDD. I stopped being crazy prior to my menstruation cause of bc and zoloft.Until 6 months ago EVERY two weeks I was breaking up with bae. We get along on my period and one week after and then it will usually start. Third week of ciklus we didn&#039;t seeing each other and after that I usually get period and calm.It is surprise we didn&#039;t break up for good and I can&#039;t even describe what that does for our sex life.I had terrible fights with my mom and I felt like I&#039;m most miserable person in world. Not anymore. I was scared when I stop taking birth control that I will again start acting nut but now is Zoloft taking care of that."
