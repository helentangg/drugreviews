"After trying every other kind of antidepressant over the past 9 or so years, Nardil was my first try at an MAOI. The dietary restrictions were less difficult to get used to and less strict than they appeared at first. I was on 30mg of Nardil a day and didn&#039;t notice any effect, but after increasing to 45mg/day, I felt the best I&#039;ve felt in years and it seemed that my depression might be cured at last. ...however, I also had the most side effects I&#039;ve ever had from a medication: constipation, difficulty urinating, insomnia, and inability to reach an orgasm. Because of the bladder issues and insomnia, I&#039;ve been forced to resume my search."
