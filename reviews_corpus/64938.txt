"I was on Citalopram for OCD for 10 years until it unfortunately pooped out. I went through 3 months of hell not being able to think straight and being practically housebound! But, I have now been on 50mg of Sertraline for just over three weeks and all I can say is stick with it. I really felt like nothing was ever going to help me, I had almost given up. But after three weeks, I am now on my fourth day in a row of feeling much more positive and back to my old self again. My intrusive thoughts are not as frequent and do not stick as much when they do come. I now feel strong enough to start helping myself by challenging my condition. Different medications work for different people so keep trying until you get it right. Everyone deserves life!"
