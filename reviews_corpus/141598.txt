"Male, Age 45. First tried Prozac (fluoxetine) then Paxil (paroxetine) for a month, didn&#039;t help &amp; felt a little weight gain. Tried Lexapro (escitalopram) 10mg for 6 weeks &amp; felt a little better. Increased to 20mg really helped improve my anxiety/depression &amp; no weight gain, also take daily Deplin (L-methylfolate) 15 mg, SAMe 400mg (3x daily) &amp; Vitamin D3 (4000 IU)."
