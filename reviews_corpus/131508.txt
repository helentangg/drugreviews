"I&#039;ve been on 75mg of venlafaxine for 6 or 7 years. It is good for me. Before Effexor, my emotions felt like being hit by a truck. After Effexor, it gives me a moment to THINK about things, rather than just disintegrating into a puddle on the floor. I still have feelings, but they&#039;re not as overwhelming and I don&#039;t feel like I HAVE to react to them. 
Side effects: sweating and tiredness. I take a lot of naps!
Missing a dose: About an hour or two after my time to take my pill, if I forget to, I&#039;d get tingly and dizzy.
Withdrawal: I recently tried to stop taking Effexor cold turkey. I lasted 6 days. Intense anger, bursting into tears, a static feeling in my head, like a TV set on no channel, and a tingly feeling in my lips."
