"Have been on Amitrip for three years now and haven&#039;t had a cyclic vomiting syndrome episode.
My gastro doctor tried as last resort and it works.
25 mg at bedtime my bouts started like clock work at 8 am.
My last episode lasted from June 18th to July 4th.
3 different hospital stays.
My weight went from 235 lbs to 180 lbs.
Thought my life was ending.
I was skeptical that this pill at bedtime would do anything.
But I couldn&#039;t have been more wrong, it saved my life so for anyone reading this please try this treatment and I hope you are as lucky as me. I am 57 years old."
