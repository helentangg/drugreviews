"This medicine has made me feel like a different person !!!! I didn&#039;t realized I was depressed , just felt so bad physically and just so blah mentally and felt upset that I was only 48 but felt 98. I had alway gotten from Drs you need to loose some weight and exercise and you will feel better! But the way I felt I know wasn&#039;t from that and thankfully a new dr I saw wanted me to try this and it has made me feel alive again and I actually hav so much more energy than I had!! Had a few side affects and headache the first couple evenings but that waent away quick. I also sleep all night which was something else I wasn&#039;t doing.it has been a wonder drug for me."
