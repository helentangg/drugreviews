"I am a man and I started Viibryd primarily to reduce the sexual side effects of other SSRI&#039;s. I have tried many different SSRI&#039;s over the years for generalized anxiety and until now Zoloft was the best choice for me. I tend to be sensitive to medications and am usually affected by side effects, but at the same time I usually respond well to lower dosages. I personally had severe side effects including vertigo, and watery diarrhea. All the side effects passed after a couple of weeks and increasing the dosage had little effect on me. Currently on 20mg and staying there. My libido has improved significantly and I am very happy with the results. Side effects were brutal, but worth working through them!"
