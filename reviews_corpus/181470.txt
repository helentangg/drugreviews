"LIVING ALL my life and only knowing  highs and lows of depression,  I&#039;ve taken many pills. Sure they worked at first but then  the depression came back, prozac is quite a ride from when you first take it,  there are so many changes. I&#039;m at 40mg,  6 months later I have diarrhea and have lost a lot of weight. I hope I&#039;m not dying.  I was a complete idiot and delusional the last 45 years, this pill made me feel like I&#039;m supposed to feel,   it doesn&#039;t feel fake. Yes I did experience memeory loss,  fatique,   have to look a back and live with my mistakes before prozac,  prozac made everything all clear,  I feel sharper as well,  it actually cured my depression.    Just made sure to follow instructions as you increase dosage"
