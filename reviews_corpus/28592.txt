"I have been only taking Lexapro 10mg for less than a week....The first couple of days I felt great but now I am starting to feel some side effects. It is making me zone out and feel &quot;blah&quot; and very tired. My doctor assured me that I may feel this way for a month or so then it should ease off. I am hoping so but it has helped with my depression and anxiety."
