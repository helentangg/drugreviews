"Suicidal, depressed and anxious for 9 years, finally decided I could not handle it on my own anymore and decided to seek help. My doctor prescribed me Paxil and 20 minutes after I took it I no longer wanted to kill myself (this feeling was often, all day everyday almost).  It&#039;s now been 3 days and still going good. There are however side effects, loss of appetite (not good I&#039;m too thin already), blurred vision (very difficult for an artist), insomnia, impossible to reach ejaculation, also have experienced some increased anxiety.

Despite these side affects im faced with a choice, accept the side effects or continue to live my life feeling sad and lonely."
