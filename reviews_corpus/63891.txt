"Went on Sertraline about 20 months ago . Started on 50mg and gradually upped to 100mg. Had a few side effects to start with . Dizziness  ( which I was getting with anxiety anyway) tiredness and nausea. Stuck with it and after a few weeks they passed. They were fantastic for me , really helped . Could feel the anxiety and anger but it seemed to go away or never really surface . Unfortunately I thought I was ok after a while and came off them without asking my doctor and the anxiety has come back so I&#039;m starting again today pm 25mg . I hope they help as well as they did the first time"
