"Been on a plethora of antidepressants most of my life. This one by far has been the worst. I had all of the negative side effects pretty intensely. Insomnia, vomiting, diarrhea, severe headaches, severe agitation, visual hallucinations, feeling like I was crawling out of my skin, sweats, and psychosis so bad to the point, I blacked out and attacked my best friend physically. Thanks be to God my friend was there and I&#039;m not in jail!  Just based on my personal experience I think this drug needs to be tested out more thoroughly. I felt like a wretched guinea pig on it. I stopped the drug a few days ago...going through the horrible withdrawals now.  The &quot;bath salts&quot; of antidepressants!!!!!"
