"This is a drug that takes a long time to get fully into your system.  It does not just &quot;work&quot; after a day or a week.  I was on this medication from 2004 to 2007.  It worked pretty well (about 85%) for anxiety, but not very well for depression.  My nutritionist and Doctor agreed that it was the medication that caused me to gain 30 pounds (which by the way, does not help depression.) I had to keep a food journal and keep track of my activity level. The overall panic subsided, but at night when trying to fall asleep I would occasionally have chest pain, or rapid heartbeat, or trouble breathing.  You just have to try to find ways around medicines to cope.  "
