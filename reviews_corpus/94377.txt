"I&#039;ve tried so many antidepressants but this one has been the best. I was on 10mg for a month and just had my dosage increased to 20 mg, two days ago. I do feel sick; nausea and a little disoriented but those are bearable side effects to me. I have had energy, better concentration but the biggest thing I love about this antidepressant is that I have my sex drive back. My libido wasn&#039;t affected like it has been in the past with other meds; I&#039;ve actually had increased sex drive. So far I feel &quot;okay&quot; but hopefully since 20mg is the therapeutic dose, that I feel more &quot;content&quot; or &quot;happy&quot; with my life soon. "
