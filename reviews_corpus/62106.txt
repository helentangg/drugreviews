"Been on Celexa for three months. It took a couple weeks to adjust to mild side effects such as heartburn and a general feeling that I&#039;m full or not hungry. However, I no longer have those side effects and I feel great now!  I have social anxiety and for the first time in years I feel happy and more confident in social situations. I feel normal and have nearly no negative thoughts any longer."
