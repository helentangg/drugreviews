"I had anxiety a few times in my life, the last time was so bad and my doctor put me in 10mg Citalopran but worked so slow, now that my anxiety came back, he put me on 10mg Escitalopran. At the begining was horrible, so much nervous, trembling, couldnt sleep.. I use to read this reviews day by day trying to keep going on my med and dont give up. I made it! Now after my 3rd week on meds I feel so much better! A lot of my symptoms desappeared , my over thinking, my worries, my fears they are all gone!  Thanks to everybody for this reviews that help me a lot to not give up on my meds. My advise is that keep taking your med because is worth it. Just give time to work. I will keep taking escitalopran for the rest of my life is necessary.Good luck"
