"I am scared of antidepressants as I had a bad occurrence weaning off Zoloft 10 years ago. I moved across country and back in 2 months time lock, stock and barrel.  My new doctor has placed me on Cymbalta.  I started on Nov. 16, so it&#039;s been 3 weeks and 1 day.  The first 4 days were the hardest; however, I have felt more calm and at peace.  I only want to be on it to get me through the rough patch.  Once I have a routine again (job) I will (under a doctor&#039;s care) wean off slowly.  I was told weaning off Zoloft should have been done in a year&#039;s time, not 3 months as I thought would work.  I learned a very hard lesson.  My advice, don&#039;t wean off any of these medicines on your own.  It was extremely costly for me and difficult."
