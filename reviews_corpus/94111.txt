"I have tried Brintellix on two separate occasions. The doctor said it would take four weeks to take full effect. On the fourth day of taking it, my mood changed drastically. I was very easy to cry and was secluding myself. I quit taking it. Went back to normal bubbly self. I didn&#039;t tell my doctor that I quit taking it nor how my personality changed. Insurance paid for 90% of it. 

A few months later, I tried taking it again. By the 4th or 5th day, I was very irritable, went into rage and was generally mad. I am a social person with a bubbly personality. I immediately quit taking it again!!  I will be telling my doctor to quit writing a prescription for it and will NEVER try taking it or anything closely related to it!"
