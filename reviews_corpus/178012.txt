"This medication saved my life. I had been suffering from a back injury for years, and the last 4 years were the worst. I&#039;ve done everything except surgery. I started gaining weight because my back pain limited my daily life.
The final straw was after having a child I couldn&#039;t walk for 2 months. The amount of narcotics it took for me to even stand was a fight with these doctors. Seems like it&#039;s a fight to get help with the pain. 
I finally asked to try Cymbalta, within 2 days I was taking only a 1/4 of my other medications to help me stand.
I&#039;ve been on it for 8 months, and from the day I gave birth I was 270lbs, I am now at 150, my daughter is only 10 months old.
I&#039;m just out of pain and can do things any normal 31yr old can do"
