"I have been on 10mg. of Lexapro for about 4 weeks. I think in the first few weeks it made my depression worse. I began to have very crazy scary thoughts. I held on, now I am just sort of o.k., I am having a few hours a day of feeling a lot of relief, but still the morning is a down hill slope. I am going to give it a few more weeks. My anxiety has gotten a bit better."
