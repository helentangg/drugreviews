"Lexapro has saved my life and my marriage.  I had been depressed since I was very young and was told that antidepressants weren&#039;t an option while growing up.  Finally when I got married and realized that depression was going to ruin my marriage, my husband and I decided to try medication.  I am not big on taking medication unless you absolutely have to, but I felt there was no other option.  Man, am I glad I did!!  The initial side effects were pretty hard to deal with, but after that I felt great.  I take 10 mg every day at 1pm.  I have found that is the best time for me.  It has absolutely changed my life."
