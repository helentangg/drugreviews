"I was put on Celexa when I was 19 and I loved it. It made me feel great. Then one day I decided to stop taking my medicines after a few months my depression returned. I have been on 5 or 6 different meds for depression and each time I stopped taking them. I am now 9 months pregnant and my depression, anxiety, and stress where so terrible that my obgyn prescribed me back on to Celexa. I have been taking it for about a week now and already my friends noticed some change in my moods. It&#039;s true at first you will be tired but after a few days of adjusting you will be back to normal. For me the only side effects that I have found that won&#039;t go away are the crazy dreams and sweating while I&#039;m asleep. Other then that I wished I never got off of Celexa."
