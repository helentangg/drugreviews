"This medication is the only thing that managed to keep me functional as a human being. Panic attacks, and severe depression...this seems to do the trick for both problems, and does wonder for my IBS as well! I have started and stopped multiple times (usually just because of the &quot;I feel fine, why bother with it?&quot; syndrome) but the last time, the doctor told me, &quot;Consider yourself like a diabetic; they need insulin because their body doesn&#039;t regulate it correctly. You need this because your brain doesn&#039;t regulate serotonin correctly. Don&#039;t feel ashamed! The choice is to lie around and do nothing all day because you hate pills, or take the pills and live your life.&quot;  Effexor XR allows me to live normally."
