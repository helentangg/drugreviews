"Use to sleep through night time back pain.  When I wake up at night it is easy to get back to sleep.  I use 10 mg.
Initially woke in morning with headaches but learned to take 3 hours before bedtime and no more headaches.  Sometimes slightly groggy in morning but short lived.  Sometimes wake in morning really stiff but had good sleep.  Couple stretching exercises and good to go."
