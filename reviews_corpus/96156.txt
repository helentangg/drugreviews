"I had a traumatic experience with an ex-boyfriend of mine three years back and I&#039;ve been fine. I am now deployed and doing missions in Iraq and have seen a few explosions and what not and I think that&#039;s what triggered my Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. I was hesitant about trying medicines but they said I could take them and still go out on the road. So far they seem to be helping lighten my mood and actually want to get out of bed in the morning and not worry or get irritated and paranoid at random times like I normally would. I am also taking it with clonazepam, which is helping a lot! No side effects yet, hopefully none to come! "
