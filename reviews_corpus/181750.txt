"I took this with bupropion.  I stopped bupropion, because I was so edgy and irritable. It was suggested I wait for Prozac to take full effect in about 1 month. I stopped Prozac last night after a week of it alone.  I was edgy, irritable, and didn&#039;t feel like doing productive things like care about my job, or care about studying on investing choices. I just wanted to take a nap to relieve the buzzing in my head.  Today I am not taking anything.  I feel better than yesterday. "
