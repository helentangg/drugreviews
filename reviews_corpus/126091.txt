"Depression and anxiety and life issues were miserable and impacting my relationships. Went to the doc and found out my blood pressure was sky-high. Described my life issues and he put me on Viibryd and blood pressure meds. Side effects have been mild: restless legs first week, crazy strange dreams that though sometimes violent provoke no anxiety or fear, gas, and aching legs. The legs thing is the worst, though it is subsiding (into my second month of 40mg). But going for walks, made my legs ache like they&#039;d been hit. My bowels move GREAT, which they haven&#039;t in a while. The gas is hilarious to me. LOVE this medicine. I feel wonderful."
