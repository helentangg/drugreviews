"I started using sertraline back in August 2014. After the initial side effects of high panicking and anxiety , which was why I was put the drug in the 1st place, the drug certainly helped me get back to a healthy state of mind. But like an idiot , after 6 months I thought I could tackle the world on my own again and dropped to 25mg a day for 4 weeks. Then stopped altogether. Big mistake. 3 weeks later bang, high anxiety kicked in and stress. So I&#039;m back on 50mg a day for at least the next 6 months.  Not that there is any problem with going back on it, more like a wake up to myself not too get carried with recovery.  Enjoy the good times and the help sertraline can give. Got to put up with a few side effects of going back on them........."
