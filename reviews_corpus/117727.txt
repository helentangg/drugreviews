"I&#039;ve suffered from migraines for 14 years and have taken numerous medications for prevention including Topamax (Topamax caused MANY bad, undetermined health issues).  My Internal Medicine physician took me off Topamax and put me on 25 mg of Nortriptyline for migraine prevention.  Almost immediately, I had relief from migraines, had clarity of mind even better than ever before, had a great attitude. I felt &quot;normal&quot; for the first time in my life.  This medication caused noticeable urinary retention, constipation and increased appetite which caused weight gain.  Due to weight gain, I was changed to Pristiq.  Migraines have returned.  I intend to ask to be put back on Nortriptyline and will have to alter diet and exercise."
