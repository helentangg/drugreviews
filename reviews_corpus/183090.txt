"This medication for me was ok, it gave me less side effects than other antidepressants. I was prescribed it for Major Depressive Disorder along with BPD and anxiety. It seemed to make me a bit null at first then it helped me think more clearly, less invaded by suicidal thoughts, etc. I do take it along with quetiapine (an antipsyscotic) and it seems to meld well with it ."
