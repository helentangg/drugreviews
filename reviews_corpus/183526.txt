"My doctor prescribed Cymbalta to combat the neuropathy in my feet and legs. Note: the first few months were great. The pain and tingles in my feet and legs went away and so did my depression! BUT After a few months, I began to get odd thoughts, manic, not characteristic of me. I told my doctor, who missed the signs. Two months after that, I began impulsive buying from an auction site. It got worse and worse, spending money I did not have, borrowing money from my paycheck and from relatives. Finally someone intervened. They recognized it was uncharacteristic and figured out it was the Cymbalta. I had to go through physical and psychological withdrawals."
