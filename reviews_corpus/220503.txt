"Amazing medicine. I had migraines for 20 years and they had worsened to twice a week with no relief from Axert, which had worked relatively well in the past.  I tried Topamax and experienced horrible mood swings, anger and hyperactivity.  Went on Amitriptyline and gradually moved up to 50mg as it wasn&#039;t fully effective at lower doses.  Once I reached 50mg my migraines went down to twice a month.  Even better, the Axert works much more effectively when I do have a migraine.  I had dry mouth early on but this went away.  The only other side effect is occasional dizziness when I stand up (but this only happens about once a week and clears after a few seconds), which is common on this medicine.  It has totally changed my life."
