"Took for two days, slept a lot in and out. Felt like a zombie, lost memory, couldn&#039;t function normally. Called the Dr. after two doses , he suggested cutting the pill in half , will try soon , afraid to start again, I didn&#039;t like the effect at all , but I will try soon again. Lets hope I can tolerate better this time . I will resume tonight, praying this works. I wouldn&#039;t suggest driving at all."
