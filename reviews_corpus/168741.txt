"Background: Essential Tremor with Social Anxiety and IBS. I&#039;m naturally VERY happy.

From 6mo Escitalopram 10mg to 1mo Viibryd 10mg.

Upped to 20mg Viibryd but two hours in, had panic attack tremors. Went back to 10mg for a 1mo more, until VERY HEAVY depression episodes at around 6 PM till 10 PM (took the pill at 8 AM) appeared. Also it gave me very bad diarrhea after eating most foods.

Can&#039;t cold-turkey it (which I could with Escitalopram), would panic/shake/depression.
Had to take the abuse till I switched back Escitalopram 10mg - which thankfully calmed me down from Viibryd withdrawal!

I don&#039;t feel this is the right drug for happy people with anxiety. It does more unnecessary anti-depressant changes than it does anxiety improvements."
