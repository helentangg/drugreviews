"I&#039;ve been a migraine headache sufferer since childhood. For the past two month, I was having a severe episode of migraine and ended up in a ER within three days apart. Then the resident neurologist gave me prescription for Nortriptyline 10mg (increasing the dose every week by 10mg till it reaches 40mg). It is two weeks now (20mg), I didn&#039;t have any migraine headache but for some reason I have this fear of being on a medicine for the rest of my life. However I&#039;m very, very excited to live two weeks without migraine."
