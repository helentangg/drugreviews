"So you live in horrible pain and I was since 1988. Since 1988!
29 years of agony. Endless worthless &#039;specialists&#039;. I cannot tell you this unless the &#039;broken neck&#039; ( as I call it, that&#039;s how it felt). I need you to understand  how it was. I would have chose cancer over this endless pain.
I read about aimtrip for pain. I said let&#039;s try amitriptyline. Quietly and without fanfare, this drug came to me.  My pain is completely gone. If you have endless pain, ask your doctor to give you this drug."
