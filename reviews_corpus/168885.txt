"I had to taper off my Lexapro while starting this. I did a wk of the 10 mg during that and now I&#039;m on my 2nd wk of 20mg. I&#039;m not having any side effects like others have mentioned, but I&#039;m not seeing any benefit yet either. I just spent 3 hrs yesterday crying, and then alternated that with being angry about everything (torn window screen, broken handle, garage motor quitting-everything was crap!), then I&#039;d sob again. I hope this picks up soon, as does my family! However, I&#039;m also 46 and wonder if some of this is pre-menopause??? Maybe I need to call my Dr. and have the dosage increased now? Otherwise, I see him again in 5 wks. I just don&#039;t know, but my Dr has high hopes and praise for this medicine."
