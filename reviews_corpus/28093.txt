"Lexapro works! I didn&#039;t have any side effects except for small headaches for the first couple of weeks that would show up for 10 seconds, then be gone. I did notice for the first week that I would have carb cravings and I didn&#039;t get full as quickly, but I watched what I ate and tried not to give in to any crazy cravings. I have not gained any additional weight. The first day I took the lexapro, it kicked in around 5-6pm and I just got insanely giggly and happy. All of a sudden, it was like a breeze blew past my mind and the little gremlin in my mind that constantly said &quot;I hate everything&quot; was gone. I do notice short term memory is easily forgotten; out of sight, out of mind. I&#039;m sure that&#039;s due to relief from anxiety. I am finally happy!"
