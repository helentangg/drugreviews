"I&#039;m a hypersensitive and socially anxious person. After reading a tons of information about my issue, i decided to try a SSRI, Lexapro especially. I began using Lexapro 10mg about two weeks ago. It&#039;s a miracle drug, after just 4-5 days, my hypersensitivity and social anxiety almost gone!. I also notice a significant improvement in my premature ejaculation, which&#039;s a positive side-effect to me. What most people didn&#039;t know about SSRI, is that they acually don&#039;t reduce anxiety alone, scientific research suggest that they actually reduce &quot;neuroticism&quot;, which include anxiety, fear, moodiness, worry, envy, frustration, jealousy, and loneliness"
