"It took a while for me to get the courage to go to see a psychiatrist.  I finally decided I had to get my life back.  I wasn&#039;t cooking for my family, taking care of my house, contacting friends, even able to make it through my day at work without hiding in the bathroom to cry.  Fluoxetine has helped me calm down and get my life back again.  My doctor started me out slow, 5 mg to start.  I felt funny a few days.  Then when I upped it to 10 mg I once again felt funny for a few days, but now I feel I  have way more good days than bad. It&#039;s only been 3 1/2 weeks but I&#039;m so thankful that I started taking it."
