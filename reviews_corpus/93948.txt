"Been on Trintellix 5mg for about three weeks and going to increase to 10mg tomorrow. The first week, I got stomach pain, but not nausea. The second week I got diarrhea for 4 days and then I started to have headaches + panic attack in the evening. I take Xanax for that. I was diagnosed with atypical depression after several tests to rule out other illnesses. It took me about a year and I got more fatigued that I could barely walk. I was constantly hungry, used to wake up in the middle of the night, and had constant thoughts that I couldn&#039;t get rid of. My depression was triggered by prolonged school anxiety, I tried Zoloft and Cipralex but they gave me bad side effects. Trintellix is slowly increasing my energy and mood."
