"I&#039;ve used this drug 2 times for pain and spasming due to focal distonia.   First time was ten years ago and I had no response to it at all: not better, not negative.  Then recently for focal dystonia and arthritis pain, and am rhappy with the results.  I&#039;ve been in constant creepy pain for a couple decades and for the first time, I have actually walked down the street, a couple times breathing freely and comfortable in my skin.  I use 100 mg with tramadol, but the elivil is the closer.  Weight gain and itching are side effects but if you start out knowing you&#039;ll crave tubs of ice cream you can discipline yourself and the food cravings become manageable instead of being a toss up between 50lbs overweight or pain."
