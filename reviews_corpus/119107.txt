"I started taking Zoloft about 3 1/2 weeks ago. The first week I started to feel better. Though about 5 days in I had a really bad hotflash where I had to lay on the floor for about 5 minutes, and then I felt like I was going to throw up. Haven&#039;t had that sense. I do feel tired so I&#039;ve started taking it at night. Also, I feel like I have restless leg syndrome. But other than those things I am now able to focus and my OCD seems to have calmed down a lot. I still get anxious, but it doesn&#039;t stick around as long and I&#039;m able to move on from it easier. I feel like I can live in the moment and not worry about my past or present or what issue I need to stop before it happens. I am able to focus better at work too. I think my husband likes me now."
