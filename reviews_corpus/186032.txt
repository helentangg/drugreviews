"Have been on Prestiq 50 for 2 weeks, was previously on Effexor 75mg for 6 months. Doc has put me on the Prestiq because it is supposed to be easier to wean off of.  I don&#039;t think these meds have helped my depression at all.  The first few day on the Prestiq I was very dizzy, since then I am even more anxious and depressed.  I am seeing my doc in a week to taper off these horrible meds.  NEVER AGAIN.  I also take Adderall XR 25mg twice daily for ADHD, these meds usually calm me.  I am now having to take Klonopin daily just to get by.  Also my hairdresser noticed how much HAIR LOSS I&#039;ve had. I still don&#039;t know if this is from stress, the Effexor, Adderall or my birth control pills, since all meds can have this effect."
