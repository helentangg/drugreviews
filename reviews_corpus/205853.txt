"Started with Wellbutrin 300mg - I was way to agitated -- went to Cymbalta - loved it except for the lack of ability in the sack. Went to Celexa - worked okay stayed on it for 3 months but never felt anything. So during the 3 months doctor added Wellbutrin - does not help. Celexa made me feel - no sorry it didn&#039;t make me feel anything but overall in some ways I kind of liked not feeling but that is not life. So the doctor changed to Pristiq -- WOW I feel alive, energetic, really great. I hope this continues. Oh yea .. no lack in the sack on this one. My real message here is that I hope each of you continues to work with you doctor and find the right medicine."
