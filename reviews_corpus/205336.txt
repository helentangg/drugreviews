"I started taking Pristiq a little over a month ago, and it took over 2 months for the company to accept me into the program. Im only 18 and don&#039;t usually prescribe this medication to people who are around 18. But since I am younger, the medicine is completely free which is nice. I took a DNA test which tells you which medication is most efficient  and this was the 1/3 on the list for antidepressants. Haven&#039;t had many side effects, but over the more time I take it I feel more numb. However, I didn&#039;t take the medicine for 2 days and the withdrawal is horrid."
