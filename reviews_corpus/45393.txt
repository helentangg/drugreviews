"I have been taking 40-60mg of fluoxetine (prozac) for depression for about 4 years and had never realised it had such an effect on my fibro until now. I have been COMPLETELY pain and fatigue free for a few years and stupidly thought my fibromyalgia had just gone away but I came off the prozac a month ago and it is back with a vengeance. I cannot attribute it to anything else. 

Fluoxetine has totally relieved me of my depression AND fibromyalgia and i cannot recommend it enough. 
I really hope it can help others as much as it has helped me."
