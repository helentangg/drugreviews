"I took this medicine for 6 years and it helped my depression. Allergies became much worse over time and I assumed it was just seasonal or food allergy. Suffered a lot with allergies over the 6 years I was on Cymbalta and was unable to do much of anything even though I have 4 school aged kids. When my Doctor recently increased dosage, my allergies went haywire..... prickly feeling in fingers arms back, itchy nose, throat and private region. Because the allergies came on slowly, I didn&#039;t realize it was Cymbalta causing the problem. I really suffered with this and would hate for another to do the same. If you have weird allergy like symptoms, check the Cymbalta. It helped my depression, but I still was not able to live comfortably because of the reaction."
