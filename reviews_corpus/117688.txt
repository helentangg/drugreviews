"I have suffered with Fibromyaliga for nearly 25 years. This is the only medication that helped with my pain; helped with sleep and did not make me feel &quot;dopey&quot; all day.  I can&#039;t say it will work for everyone, but it has helped me. I have been on it for 20 years.
I take 50Mg at night about an hour before bed. When there are weather changes coming through, my pain gets worse, I take 60Mg."
