"I have been on and off Cymbalta for about 3 years. Just today after visiting with my Doctor and with my husbands honest feedback (he was there with me), I realized that I have to go back on it. So I&#039;m going off Wellbutrin, which had worked great in the past. Cymbalta really is the best anti-depressent that I have tried, and I have tried a lot.  The only reasons I ever went off it in the past was the bloated feeling I felt and weight gain.  So I am committing to eating better (watch calorie intake and get off the carbs) and excercising.  Going to go buy a treadmill tomorrow. Keeping my fingers crossed that I&#039;m able to stay on it for good this time."
