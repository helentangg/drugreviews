"I started Effexor after the birth of my first child due to post-partum depression. I have never been severely depressed prior to this. My doctor first prescribed Zoloft which did not help at all. After two weeks, I was put on Effexor and started feeling better within a few days. The only side effect that I ever noticed was having no sex drive at all. I stopped taking it after a year (I tapered so I did not notice any withdrawal symptoms everyone talks about) and was recently put back on it due to some family issues pushing me back into a depression. The first few days are rough but I&#039;ve been on it for a week now and I do feel a difference. My anxiety and mood has improved and I can actually function. This medicine works great for me."
