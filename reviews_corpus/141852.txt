"I have been on Lexapro for almost two weeks now, my depression has gotten better but unfortunately it causes me to have problems in bed.  I am male 26 years old, my libido is the same, for some reason shortly after starting this medication I cannot climax sexually.  Paxil was similar but I could still finish. I am planning on getting off this medication as fast as I can."
