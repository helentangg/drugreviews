"I learned that it is best to take Pristiq in the morning because it is a stimulating, time release drug. I try and take it by 9 am. It can affect sleep if you take it later. I had decreased appetite and some nausea so take with food in the morning. I avoided any caffeine and alcohol as that can increase side effects."
