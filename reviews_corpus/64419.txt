"Took two weeks for Zoloft to kick in . Started on 100 mg made me too nervous dropped to 50mg , seems to work better for me. Also take 1 mg Ativan at night for Restless Leg Syndrome and to help with sleep . No bad effects from either , slight nausea with Zoloft on empty stomach . Anxiety hit me hard and sudden . It is a terrible experience !"
