"I started at 20mg of Lexapro for my severe depression.  After seeing minimal improvement, I was bumped up to 40mg.  I noticed improvement at 40mg but not enough. Fortunately my doctor was willing to prescribe an off label 60mg dose.  He told me he has several patients who require doses of 60mg or 80mg of Lexapro.  The 60mg dose has produced pretty good results in me.  (I am 30 lbs overweight and get very little exercise, which may explain why I needed the larger dose).  Reading &quot;Feeling Good&quot; by Dr. David Burns also helped reduce my depression."
