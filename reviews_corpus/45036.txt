"I&#039;ve tried many diffrent antidepressants over the years and never found one that worked for me. After each pregnancy my mood got worse. I couldn&#039;t get out of bed and get anything done. I never wanted to do anything outside the house. I also would yell all the time due to irritability. Prozac has made me more calm. I don&#039;t jump right to yelling cause someone was &quot; annoying me.&quot; When you first start it, for about 3 weeks u feel weird. Spacy, clumsy and I couldn&#039;t sleep. I lost weight right away cause I wasn&#039;t eating to fill a void. Don&#039;t stop cause u feel loopy in the beginning! It has changed my life. Me and my husband are getting along better! 1 NEG I twitch. My legs arms hips will twitch when I stop moving. I take 60mg. Helps me before my period 2"
