"Condition:  Severe Hot Flashes
Rx:  Paroxetine 10mg (aka Paxil) by Mylan
Two weeks (14 days) into first time taking paroxetine 10mg (aka Paxil), and working great for me!  No more hot flashes.  Started gradual use at one tablet every other day while weaning off Rx Estradiol 2mg.  After two weeks, dosage is daily.  Taken at bedtime.

The only negative side effect experienced with the first pill was waking up drowsy and lethargic lasting throughout the day.  This was quickly remedied this by cutting pill in half; taking half at bedtime, and half next day at noon with food.

The 7.5mg Brisdelle brand is very costly and out of my budget.  The Paroxetine 10mg is covered by insurance.  Practical to cut in half, then other half in-half = @7.5mg."
