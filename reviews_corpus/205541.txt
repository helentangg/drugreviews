"I was treated for depression with Pristiq for a little over a year. I had previously tried multiple other antidepressants, to no avail. Once I started taking Pristiq I felt like a whole new person. I was energetic when I woke up, I had increased motivation, and I was finally happy. The side effects were minimal. When I first began taking it, I slept a lot more than usual, which almost made me quit taking it. I lost about 20 pounds in the first few months. The one negative that I experienced was the clenching of my jaw. In the mornings I could barely open my mouth because my jaw was so tight from clenching it shut all night. I eventually was at a point in my life where I felt that I no longer needed medication, and went off of Pristiq."
