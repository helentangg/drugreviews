"I had dysthymia, low level but nagging depression after dealing with elderly parents, their health and emotional issues, resulting ultimately in moving them out of their home: father into nursing home and mother into assisted living. Watched as father died a slow natural death after years of health problems. Started Viibryd and on day four felt better. When titrating to 40mg felt bad physically in general, so have stayed on 20mg; been there for several weeks. I feel like the old me, not irritable and snappy, especially with my husband.  Feel more positive, confident and outgoing. I will be 57 in a few days. The bad: increased appetite especially for sweets and at night and 10  lb weight gain.
