"Took successfully in 2003-4 for PTSD and associated anxiety. No side effects (other than lost libido) and came off them easily under doctor&#039;s supervision.
13 years later I was put back on them due to depression and anxiety. This time they have been horrendous! 
Headaches, bones in my face aching, nausea, a&quot;creeping&quot; feeling through my hands, arms and shoulders, disorientation, racing heart, not passing urine frequently enough and terrifying sleep problems (insomnia but feeling like you&#039;re being suffocated and having awful thoughts). 
After 12 days I realised I couldn&#039;t take these symptoms any more, on advice of a doctor I ceased instantly, by Day 2 the withdrawal was awful-a more intense version of the side effects. Easing now (day 4)"
