"I have been taking this medicine for a little over 2mths and I have notice a big difference in my behavior. I laugh a lot more now and talk in a group more and today I was able to go shopping to two different stores and sign up for the gym all by myself and not feel like everyone is talking or staring at me. I even was able to talk to people in the store and not feel funny. I hope this lasts because I kind of like getting out by myself although I still have to push myself to do things, overall I am thankful for this medicine."
