"Lexapro is wonderful! I suffer from generalized anxiety disorder and was put on Lexapro about 5 months ago. I started with the 10mg does, but now taking 20mg. It took about 5 weeks for me to notice this medicine was working. I have not experienced any side effects so far and have actually lost weight since I have been on Lexapro. Instead of me being edgy, uptight, panicking, etc. I am now HAPPY and CALM! Lexapro is really a miracle."
