"I was going through a very deep and dark depression for several months. Prozac was the very anti-depressant to work for me. After about 2 weeks, I could tell the medication was really working. I wasn&#039;t having constant OCD related circling thoughts that made my depression worse and I wasn&#039;t on the verge of crying every second. This pill is a MIRACLE for me. No side effects, maybe weight gain but I&#039;m also eating again when before I was barely eating and dropped 10 lbs. Definitely take the medication at night because it&#039;ll make you tired if you take it in the morning."
