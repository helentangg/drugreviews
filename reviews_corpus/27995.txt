"I was prescribed lexapro after trying Zoloft. Zoloft did not work out for me. I&#039;ve been taking lexapro for two weeks now and over all I feel much better. I occasionally have to take half a klonopin on bad days but over all, I am improving. There were some side effects but I was able to manage them even with school. Nothing I couldn&#039;t handle. I have a much better out look, and I have motivation to help others. I&#039;m trying to exercise as well. I hope this medicine continues to help with my anxiety and depression:)"
