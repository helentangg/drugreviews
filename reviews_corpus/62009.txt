"I started this medication for depression, panic attacks, and social anxiety disorder. I felt the benefits on day 2 of starting it, and now (10 days later) I think it has been a miracle for me! I feel genuinely happy, and things that used to cause me strong anxiety are rolling off my shoulder like they&#039;re nothing. I don&#039;t feel like it has changed who I am, but simply made me a better version of myself. I would give this Rx 10 stars, but I do experience some mild side effects occasionally: nausea, headache, pupil dilation, drowsiness, loss of appetite, teeth grinding. Also, I am on 20mg but feel like it wears off in the afternoon. I am going to talk to Dr. about increasing dosage."
