"Was prescribed fluoxetine and have been taking for about 6 months. Was prescribed this for my perimenopause moodiness. Everyone was getting on my nerves I just wanted to scream every time one of my co-workers asked me a simple question. This has been life changing for me, things don&#039;t bother me like they did before. I wish I would have told my Gyn about my moodiness with PMS would have been nice to take this for that."
