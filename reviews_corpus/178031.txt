"I have Bipolar, Anxiety, and Fibromyalgia.  I was taking Lexapro for the depression and anxiety and it worked awesome. However, I was recently diagnosed with the Fibromyalgia and my Rheumatologist wanted me to try Cymbalta; only I had to stop taking the Lexapro.  I&#039;ve been on Cymbalta 60mg for 1 month; my pain has significantly improved and gotten better; however, I have more anxiety now than ever before. "
