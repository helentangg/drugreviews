"I&#039;ve been on celxia 3 days now and am enjoying them.  I have high amounts of stress in my life and when I say high. My husband is fighting cancer and going through chemotherapy.  Also we have four boys, two of are teens.  My husband and I still own our own businesses,  and three dogs.  Two days after starting these meds, one of our dogs got very sick and died quickly.  With my husband and my boys, father battling cancer, this could have been much more stressful, but these meds allow me to have feelings and Control them.   I can focus on life again, instead of constantly feel anxiety and stress.  I&#039;m 110 lbs and taking 10mg for five days then will be 20mg thereafter.  I may be over medicated but I needed a break, and it&#039;s helping tremendously"
