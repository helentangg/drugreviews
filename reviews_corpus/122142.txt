"This drug has worked for me for the last year.  It actually started working the first couple of days I used it and then I titrated up to a dose twice a day and it has enabled me to be on a more even mood throughout the day.  Just be careful when the doctor mixes it with other anxiety medicines or depression medicines. You could be susceptible to serotonin overload, I mixed it with a high dose trazodone for sleep issues and found that it made my anxiety worse and more apparent to people, so I switched to Limbitrol which seems to work well with it and don&#039;t forget, if you stop these drugs don&#039;t do it cold turkey. I stopped trazodone and went into withdrawal symptoms that triggered a major seizure for me!"
