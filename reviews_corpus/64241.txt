"just wanted to share my experience on taking this drug. I&#039;ve never felt this good in my life, I really can&#039;t remember a time when I was this clear headed and genuinely happy. I&#039;ve been on this medication for just over 6 months and they have completely changed my life. I used to feel so angry and sad and had no motivation to do anything but lie around and rot with my negativity. Since taking these everything has changed, I am applying my self more, I&#039;m doing well in college, I&#039;v gotten a raise in work, friends and family have told me how much my mood has changed, I go gym a lot, something I wouldn&#039;t have had the energy to do before.It took about 2 months for the effects to work, but its so worth it. Hope this helps someone who has reservations."
