"I began taking cymbalta six weeks ago for generalized anxiety disorder.  Although the initial side effects of disrupted sleep was difficult, it disappeared after about three weeks.  I began on 30 mg and increased to 60 mg after one week.  The results have been incredible.  For the first time ever, I can sit quietly without a million thoughts running through my head.  I no longer feel &quot;stuck&quot; on certain thoughts.  I feel calmer, more relaxed and happier.  I also find that my thinking is very clear.  Overall, feeling very, very good.  Highly recommend cymbalta."
