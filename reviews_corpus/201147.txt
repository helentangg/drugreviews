"I was prescribed this for OCD, PTSD, generalized anxiety disorder and severe depression.  First, it didn&#039;t do so much, if anything, for my depression.  In fact, I had less energy and experienced apathy on this drug .  That being said, when it came to my OCD, hyper-vigilance &amp; anxiety, this drug was a miracle drug.  It took away 85% of my obsessions &amp; became apathetic to my rituals.  

Unfortunately, after being on this for 5-6 years (and being above the absolute maximum dose @ 250mg), I&#039;ve been experiencing major &quot;poop-out&quot; effect.  I&#039;m worried that something is not going to work as well and work with the very minimal side effects that I experienced with Zoloft, as I have exhausted countless drugs."
