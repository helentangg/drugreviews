"Zoloft saved my life and my marriage. I am so grateful to the doctor who put me on this 9 weeks ago. A few side effects at start up but that went away in a matter of days and it has been smooth sailing since. Tons of energy, up early, great sleep, and I&#039;m not binge eating. I&#039;ve even lost 8.5 lbs. I was skeptical at first and hated the fact that I needed medication for anxiety and depression, but I&#039;m really glad I gave it a shot. For now, I will continue on this medication."
