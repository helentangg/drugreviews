"I actually posted on here awhile back when I first started taking Lexapro. I have now been on 10 mg/day for four months. It definitely has cured my depression and irritability, but I always feel fatigued and I can&#039;t seem to lose the belly fat I acquired since being on Lexapro. My doctor insists this doesnot affect your metabolism or cause weight gain, BUT I am eating less (and better) than ever before, and exercising, and I can&#039;t lose any weight, where before, I could lose it pretty quickly with diet and exercise. I guess I&#039;m not really sure if it&#039;s the Lexapro or not, but I do feel tired and bloated all the time. I am a really small person (4&#039;11&quot;) and the belly fat really shows. Not sure what to do."
