"This medicine has helped me overcome my addiction to alcohol.  I was self medicating for years not knowing I had underlying anxiety and depression.  Now that I am taking this combined with regular AA meetings, I no longer have any desire to drink alcohol.  It&#039;s been a miracle and I am starting to become the person I once was."
