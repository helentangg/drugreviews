"I take 25 mg at night, yes I get drowsy during the day, so yes I drink more coffee, but I just crave sleep. The bottom line is that I can function, the main reason for taking them was insomnia, and now I have good regular sleep patterns. I don;t feel like getting up in the morning, but I feel like going to bed at normal times and generally I feel normal after feeling so strained and stressed out with insomnia - a result of some anxiety and compulsive thinking. I still wish I could sleep right through the night and I probably can on 50 mg, but with 25 mg I think I get enough restful sleep, and 50 mg makes it harder to keep functioning during the day."
