"I was kind of surprised to read so many comments here that sounded exactly like my Celexa experience!  I thought maybe it was just me who responded so well to this medicine.  I have been on 3 other anti-depressants over the past 14 years.  Some stopped working after a while or some never worked for me.  But within a week of taking Celexa, I began to feel better than I could have hoped for.  After 5 weeks of taking it, I can honestly say I am happier now than I have ever been in my adult life.  This is how living is supposed to feel every day!!"
