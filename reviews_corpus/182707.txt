"I took it for 5 days 30mg and have never felt so sick. The first day I was crippled with diarrhea and a headache which continued to the following day. I then got a tightness in my throats and couldn&#039;t stop yawning. I stopped eating due to the nausea.The headache didn&#039;t go away and by day 3 was joined by an earache and sweating. Yesterday was the worst. All of I sudden my vision became blurry and I couldn&#039;t talk properly. It was terrifying. Like my brain stopped working. I couldn&#039;t drive and was so dizzy I kept falling over. I stopped immediately and now have to wait 3 days for it to leave my system. I still feel horrendous and I still can&#039;t see properly."
