"42 year old male.  Married with 2 kids.  No drugs or alcohol.  No history of anxiety or depression prior to this incident.  Several months ago I was wrongly diagnosed with throat cancer.  As it turns out I am fine and cancer free.  But the fear of leaving my family without a husband/father sent me into a tail spin filled with anxiety and depression.  The worst part is that I stopped sleeping.  My MD put me on Xanax (.5mg) and Ambien (10mg) which only made things worse.  Finally went to shrink who put me on 10 mg Lexapro that I take in the morning.  The Lex has given me the strength to get off the other 2 meds completely.  After 1 month she bumped me up to 20 mg.  After 6 weeks anxiety gone, depression gone, and I&#039;m sleeping again naturally"
