"I am 29 years old and Lexapro gave me my life back . I started taking the medication for anxiety and panic attacks . My panic attacks are the worst I always feel that I am dying or that I am having a heart attack . It made me call 911 more than I can remember and every time they come and tell me that it&#039;s just a panic attack. It was embarrassing I am on 5mg and I started on half a pill and now 3/4 of a pill and its making wonders. I don&#039;t have to take a whole pill which is still the lowest dosage.
GUYS it takes time to work . It took a month for me to work seriously 30 days exactly till it kicked in. It&#039;s not a benzo. You have to be patient. And I think that&#039;s a very fair price to pay . It waaay safer then benzos and not addictive."
