"I started using Zoloft for anxiety and minor depression. It has been a God send. I was overwhelmed and lethargic- now I am back to myself- I have energy again. I had the typical side effects for the first few weeks, but they have subsided. No weight gain or sexual side effects for me. I am very happy with the results. Everyone is different, and the medications are all different so remember to talk to your doctor if after 6 weeks you don&#039;t feel different or worse."
