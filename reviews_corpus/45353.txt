"I&#039;ve been taking prozac for three months now and I&#039;m the best I&#039;ve ever been. I can see the beauty in the world that I saw when I was little. I don&#039;t think bad thoughts anymore. Sometimes I miss a few days on my medication and I&#039;ll see something like a road or a song or an old diary entry from my journal and it will be a subtle reminder of how I felt but I am strong enough to fight those thoughts and push them away. I smile more and I talk to people. I&#039;m not scared to talk to people in public anymore. My anxiety is almost gone. I dont feel depressed anymore and I love myself. I don&#039;t hate myself anymore. I&#039;ve gotten distracted by how beautiful and amazing I can be that I don&#039;t think about flaws or imperfections. I feel great. Prozac is a miracle"
