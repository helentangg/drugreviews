"I have been taking Lexapro for over a year. Have gone from 10mg per day to 20mg per day. Switched between taking in the morning and taking at night. It has done nothing for me. I still have anger episodes, still worry constantly, and still big ups and downs. Hope to find something that helps soon. Good luck to all who are trying also."
