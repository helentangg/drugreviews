"After about two weeks on Pristiq, I can definitely say it is helping.  I had come off of Effexor (which made me gain weight) and was in a bad state with terrible anxiety.  Pristiq has made me feel more balanced.  It also reduces my appetite which is a plus.  Some dry mouth and nausea, which has subsided.  I also wake up more in the night but am able to go back to sleep."
