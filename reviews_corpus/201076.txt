"Was switching from 40mg of Celexa to 100mg of Zoloft.  Felt great first two weeks. Then it was pure hell after that.  I ended up with Serotonin syndrome during the switch. Ok.  Gave the drug a good 8 weeks.  Couldn&#039;t sleep.  Was way too activating.  Made me feel trapped in a constant state of anxiety and panic. Zaps in my fingers and toes.  My children at one point asked if I was high because of the way I was acting.  I couldn&#039;t even get a coherent thought out.  The last day I took Zoloft I can&#039;t even remember I was so out of it.  Not the drug for me.  Those shouldn&#039;t persuade you from trying it as many of these meds are hit and miss."
