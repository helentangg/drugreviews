"I have been on venlafaxine now for 3 years.  It works well most of the time but I find I need to change the dose, usually lower it, due to wild increases in either anxiety or jitters.  THings settle down then I can can go back up.  I haven&#039;t insisted on med change because when I am feeling good things are great.  Just wish i could feel great more often."
