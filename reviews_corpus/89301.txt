"2 yrs ago my oldest daughter was murdered and then this year I went through a divorce. My youngest daughter lost her job and moved in. I&#039;m on disability and mounting stress was huge. I also am also in chronic pain due to degenerative disc disease. Finely I went to my Dr and said I give in.  She put me on 10 mg of this med and first 2 wks I slept all the time but now I&#039;m noticing a change and feel a little more level. Anxiety is still here but not as bad.. I do suffer headaches and sleep long and hard and have a huge increased appetite ugh.... But overall I&#039;m feeling better and more positive .  Glad I gave it a chance."
