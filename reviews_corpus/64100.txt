"I have been on Zoloft 25-150 mg for over 2 years. This has been the BEST 2 years of your life. Let me say that it took at least 90 days to really kick in and side effects to abate. If you have spent YEARS obsessed about your every action and thought, fearful and angry, depressed the 90 days of side effects is NOTHING. NOW if you want to keep living the way you are living because of dreams, diarrhea , INITIAL loss of appetite and weight loss then so be it. Improvement takes time. I was a 10 year Paxil user. Have TRIED lithium, Prozac, Luvox, tegretol, Xanax, Valuim, Alcohol, illegal drugs, supplements, buspar, kolonopin and on and on. ZOLOFT gives me a chance at life. I am still me with growing up issues at 50 plus but man this ZOLOFT is the deal."
