"Started at 10mg for 2 weeks and took 20 for 4 weeks. Some nausea and itchy skin first 2 weeks then no noticeable side effects. However, I did experience elevated blood pressure and severe ringing in both ears but was also taking large dose of prednisone at that time for cluster headaches. Stopped taking everything and BP returned to normal. Before the BP spike, this stuff was working exactly as stated. Have tried to restart but vomit every time."
