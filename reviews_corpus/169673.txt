"I have been taking 10mg for about a month and it had almost completely eliminated the pain.  Within 2 days of my first dose, I had relief.  At 10mg the only side effects I&#039;ve had were dry mouth and mild sleepiness, but only at night, and in the early morning.  I imagine if I were on a higher dose I might have more side effects.  I occasionally will get a twinge of pain, here and there, but mostly I&#039;ve been pain free."
