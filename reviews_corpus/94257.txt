"I have been on medical disability for over a year due to treatment resistant MDD, GAD and severe anxiety.  For the past 4 years, I&#039;ve been on 375 mg Effexor with Clonazipam.  Finally trying Brintellix, and although it has only been a week into the transition to this med, I am blown away by the major improvement in my life.  I actually feel normal.  Like a veil was lifted.  I had even just been approved by insurance to receive TMS therapy, but am not going to do it since this med is so effective.  I am having significant stomach pain in the past couple of days, but just read that it has a bad interaction with the two meds I take for migraines and neck pain, Ibuprophen and Ultram. Hopefully, it will settle down."
