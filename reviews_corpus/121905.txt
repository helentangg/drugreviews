"Helped a ton post-partum. Suffered depression long after both my babies were born. Insomnia is common and I took sleep aids for the first year. Any tiny disturbance in taking it is NOT RECOMMENDED...Worst I have ever felt.  The &quot;brain zaps&quot; are like a special kind of torture and my appetite is simply non existent...not good for someone already under weight.  It saved me for a long time but the choice to come off was heavily weighed against the withdrawal symptoms. I am suffering through it a week later. Anxiety getting better but physically there is not much change."
