"I&#039;ve been on Citalopram for 7 days now.  The first 3 days were really hard.  I had stomach pains and diarrhea. After the 4th day everything started to get better.  I notice I started to become happy. I still have mood swings but they do not last as long.  The only thing that bothers me is that I do not want to work out any more.  I used to work out 2 to 3 times a week.  I hope this changes as I keep taking this.  I really miss working out."
