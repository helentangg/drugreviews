"It&#039;s only been 4 days... But wow! What a change! I cannot remember the last time I had this much energy. I actually WANT to get out of bed in the morning. I WANT to hang out with my friends. I feel... Happy and positive. I feel like it has been many many years since I&#039;ve felt this way. So far I haven&#039;t had any negative side effects aside from the first two days with stomach upset. Will report back in 6 weeks or so when it will be in full effect!"
