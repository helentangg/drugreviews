"I&#039;ve been taking this now for about six weeks. At first it worked well, but for the last two weeks it seems to have stopped working. I&#039;ve been taking ten tablets a day for the last 6 days, that&#039;s 200mg daily, of fluoxetine and it does nothing. I&#039;m going to call my doctor and ask to try something else."
