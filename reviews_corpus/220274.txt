"I take it for sleep. Started on a low dose and increased later. I am not on 75mg per day. It is not expensive and is an old medicine so side effects are well studied. Only issue is that if I miss one dose you can feel depressed. Sleep is a huge part to conquering this. I have noted a huge difference in my sleep and how I feel on a morning. I am better able to work as well. Brain coming back."
