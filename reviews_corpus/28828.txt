"I am a 31 year old male. Lexapro was prescribed because of depression and anxiety. Before this medication I wanted to do nothing but sleep all day and eat to comfort myself when I wasn&#039;t sleeping. It was affecting my marriage, my ability as a father, and my business. (I am a Realtor) Since starting this drug two weeks ago at 10mg daily, I am a new man. Within 3 to 4 days I noticed a difference. I now feel 10 years younger. I have a renewed love of life and my family. I give it 9 out of 10 because it does cause some nausea and drowsiness, so I just take it before bed. NO ADVERSE SEXUAL ISSUES...I actually can&#039;t keep my hands off of my wife now!"
