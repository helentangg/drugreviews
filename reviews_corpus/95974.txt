"My fiance and I broke up, which made me depressed. 3 weeks later, my mother passed away. I couldn&#039;t stop crying. A hospital was testing anti-depressants on me. We decided that Zoloft worked best on me. It made it easier to cope &amp; I finally stopped crying. Eventually I was able to get back to my normal life. I took it for about 2 months.If it makes you tired, take it before bed, which I did. I believe it saved my life."
