"I&#039;d struggled with anxiety all throughout my 22 years of life, and it started to get quite debilitating the last 6-10 months. My obsessive thoughts started to get uncontrollable to the point where I felt like I was in a trance/not there almost always. My psychiatrist suggested Sertraline and after hearing all the horror stories of the initial anxiety I was quite scared. I started on a quarter of a 50mg pill, so 12.5mg. I&#039;ve been on it for over a week now and already my symptoms have improved immensely. Surprisingly, I haven&#039;t had any negative side effects at all (apart from a loss of appetite). I have control over my thoughts and they are rational again. I&#039;m already feeling like my old self. Give it a go, goodluck!"
