"I have been on Pristiq for almost 2 weeks.  I have been through the medicine mill in the past 10 yrs, started on Zoloft and loved it but hit the 5 yr mark and it stopped working. Then I went to Paxil which didn&#039;t work so hot. Then there was Celexa, Cymbalta, Lexapro, Remeron, Effexor, and even Prozac so I feel like I have been there done that.  I also have to take trazodone to sleep at night.  I suffer from severe depression and anxiety and on top of that I have insomnia and even panic attacks.  For a long time I have just felt like I was going crazy and nothing was going to make me feel better. So far Pristiq has made a big difference. Hope it gets even better in the weeks to come!"
