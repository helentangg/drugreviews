"I found Cymbalta to be a miracle for me.  Within a week of taking it most of my aches and pains disappeared and even my massage therapist stated she noticed a big difference.  The problem was the side effects of sexual dysfunction and dry mouth.  I added Wellbutrin and love that medication as it greatly improved my mood, but still did not help with the sexual dysfunction.  I am now on Lamotrigine and Wellbutrin but the pains in my joints worsened unbelievably, intolerable really.  I think I will be dropping the Lamotrigine and going back to the Cymbalta, and just put up with the side effects."
