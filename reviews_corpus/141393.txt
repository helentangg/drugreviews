"I have used escitalopram 20mg for 2 years. For the first period, 1 year, It was very effective. It helped me getting out of depression. Decision making became perfect, sexual life wasn&#039;t affected. There was no physical side effect on usage with alcohol but physiologically It changes me a little emotional and depressive when I drunk.
However, after 1 year, this medicine turned me a feelingless person like a robot. I cannot cry, I cannot feel anything for a person right now. I am not sad but I am not happy too."
