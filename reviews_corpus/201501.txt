"It did a little something right from day 1, but really the first month was pretty strange. I went back and forth, finally settling on taking 1 50mg pill in the morning.  At first that made me extra sleepy all day, but that effect went away. I was feeling a bit stoned for the first month or so, but that went away too.  Now I have the ticklings of panic creep up in the normal situations, but if only for the placebo effect, I can tell myself it isn&#039;t real.  It will go away.  And then it always does!
