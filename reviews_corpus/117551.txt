"I was prescribed Pamelor by my neurologist and began taking it 29 days ago. He suggested trying either an anti-depressant or anti-seizure medication because both are known to help alleviate migraine suffering in some people. I wanted to go the anti-depressant route since I am also chronically depressed, and since counseling and other medications I have tried did not help. After the first week on Pamelor the migraines were drastically reduced in both frequency and severity, and I went the next three weeks without any pain in my head. My mood is stabilized, I have a clarity that I have never had, and getting out of bed in the morning is no longer excruciating. I am on 10 mg to start and will go higher if it is an option at next appointment."
