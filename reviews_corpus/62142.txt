"I have lived with Generalized Anxiety Disorder for as long as I can remember, like being sick before going to school every morning (I&#039;m now 40).  Nearly a year ago, my doctor tried me on Citalopram, mainly to help with headaches and muscle tension, but he commented it might help my anxiety as well (have had counseling sessions and Prozac, none much use).  A couple of months in, I was astonished at how something I had come to live with was ruling my life and began to think differently about day to day life and enjoy things I used to worry endlessly about.

However, I can now not come off them.  I have tried to stop, but the GAD just comes back, worse than it was before."
