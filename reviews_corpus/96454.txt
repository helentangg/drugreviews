"I was having heavy stress associated with my job in healthcare billing. My anxiety would go through the roof and I would have horrible acid reflux when my heart started to race. My doctor pointed out that it was the stress that was causing these anxiety peaks and recommended I take Zoloft. 

I have been taking a 100mg dose in the mornings for the last 11 days. The first 2-3 days my stomach felt bad and I was very mellow, but soon after the symptoms started to go away . 

Now I only notice that I wake in the morning with my teeth clenched tightly for some reason. It doesn&#039;t really bother me too much. It&#039;s just a weird feeling that I have little control over.

My stress has changed very little and I keep wondering if this medicine works."
