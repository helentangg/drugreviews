"I had severe generalized anxiety disorder when my doctor prescribed Celexa to me. I had awful symptoms including, severe nausea and stomach turning, headaches, restlessness, drowsiness, tired during the day, oversleeping, lack of focus, and the list goes on! Celexa has really leveled me out. I can focus and I&#039;m not making myself sick over minor everyday stress. I&#039;m happier and more balanced. I couldn&#039;t have asked for a better result. I&#039;m currently on a 40mg dose and it has worked consistently for nearly a year."
