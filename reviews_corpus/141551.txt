"I gave birth three weeks ago. About two weeks ago I was hit with postpartum depression like a ton of bricks. Started Lexapro 4 days ago after I could no longer handle the awful depression and anxiety. My overall feelings have dramatically changed. I laughed yesterday for the first time in 2 weeks, I&#039;m still depressed but I am seeing a huge difference. Side effects are very minimal, they include being a little tired and a slight headache and some nausea but being where I was, I would definitely take the side effects over my depression."
