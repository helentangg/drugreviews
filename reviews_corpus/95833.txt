"After a month of bouncing between morning and night dosing of 1 50mg pill, I settled on morning. It was making me super sleepy but that went away mostly. Didn&#039;t gain but maybe 5lbs if that (I&#039;m a gym rat somewhat).  Felt really stoned the first week or so and sleeping was strange, maybe a little erectile dysfunction at first, but all of that went away too.  A month in and the side effects are minimal.  The panic is under control, but the depression is completely gone.

THANKS A MILLION ZOLOFT."
