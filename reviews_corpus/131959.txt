"I starting taking Effexor XR two years ago for depression, generalized anxiety, social anxiety, and OCD. This drug, in combination with therapy, has really decreased my symptoms. I feel what I think &quot;normal&quot; must feel like for people who don&#039;t have the above mentioned conditions. When starting the medication, I had some of the listed side effects (weird dreams, sweating, fatigue) when starting the medication, but they all subsided after about 4 weeks. I would recommend giving this drug a try, keeping in mind that every drug works a little different for every person. It may or may not be one that works for you."
