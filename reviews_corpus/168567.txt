"Side effects: heart palpitations &amp; pounding, insomnia, numb hands, 24/7 panic attack even in my home lying in bed, fearful of getting out of bed, leaving the house. Frequent diarrhea &amp; abdominal pain. Auditory hallucinations. Had to stop, not even remotely tolerable. I got tested by &#039;Assurex Health&#039; Genesight testing which showed this to be on my &#039;green&#039; list. I see that they billed my insurance $6,224.00 and my responsibility is $1300.00 but I was told there was some sliding scale so we&#039;ll see. They&#039;re making a killing on these tests and I&#039;m afraid to try anything else on their green list, since they&#039;re all newer drugs, all costing in the range of $250 to $400, seems like there is something going on that doesn&#039;t benefit patients/victims"
