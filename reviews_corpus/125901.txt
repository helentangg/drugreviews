"Viibryd  is working well for me.  I changed from celexa to this drug due to not being effective anymore.  Initially it did give GI issues for about 4-5 days but then eventually went away.  Viibryd does has the least sexual side effects than the others. My dreams are pretty vivid with occasional well, I say not so pleasant dreams.  I went up to 40mg along with 300mg Lamitcal and 30mg Nortriptyline.   The Viibryd makes me a lot less sleepy than the celexa did.  So far all is well."
