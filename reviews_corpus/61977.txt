"Started citalopram two and a half weeks ago for anxiety and stress.  First few days felt a little strange, but the anxiety decreased from the first day of taking it. I&#039;m really impressed how much better I&#039;ve been feeling all around. Stupid little things that use to erk me don&#039;t have an effect on me anymore. I feel more like I&#039;m living in the moment rather than worrying about the future or things that could happen. I was worried about being a zombie or losing my personality, but I actually feel more outgoing and happy because I&#039;m not nervous and tense.  I wanted to share my experience because when my Dr. first prescribed it to me, I was to scared to take it. But after reading others reviews I was brave enough to try it and I&#039;m so glad I did!"
