"I suffer from GAD, what is depression, anxiety and insomnia.  The episode started in March 2015. I felt tiredness every day. I increased my physical activity to make my body triger to relax. It did not work. Within three months my diptession got worse. I felt anxiety, discomfort in my body, tiredness, lost interest to my favorit activities, in other words I survived.Then at the end of May I started taking Quaetepine 1 tab before night. It made me sleep 4-5 hrs at night. Then I splited 50mg of Pristiq into 4 parts (12.5 mg) and took them for 4 days. Next 4 days I was taking 25mg. Then 50 mg next 12 days. Now I am on 100 mg. After 45 days I felt good relief. It worked! But I felt aweful all time before. I experiensed lots of side effects."
