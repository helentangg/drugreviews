"I went on this medication due to me having severe anxiety and mild OCD to the point where it affected me in almost every aspect, I&#039;ve only been on it for almost a month and so far the results have been amazing, the only side effect that I&#039;ve really noticed is the fact that I get sleepy so I take  it before bed. Other than that I&#039;m more happy, more calm, my OCD isn&#039;t as bad anymore"
