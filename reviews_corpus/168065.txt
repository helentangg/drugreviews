"I switched from Prozac to Imipramine after reading extensively about how successful it was before the advent of SSRI&#039;s.  I have had ZERO side effects and no drowsiness on 100mg of Imipramine, while Prozac made me manic and absolutely ruined my gastrointestinal tract.  I have been very happy with this medicine, best one I have taken so far for Major Depression.  It is also cheap."
