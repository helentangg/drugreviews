"I started zoloft after months of bad panic episodes.  I was previously on celexa, but I did not feel it was working anymore.   I started on 50mg&#039;s and have worked up to 100mg.  I have had all the side effects people talk about.  Insomnia, shakiness, fast heart beat etc.  I&#039;ve been on that dose for almost 3 weeks now and my anxiety is still very high.  I take klonopin .5mg at night to sleep and another .5mg in the day if I absolutely have to have it.  I&#039;m still waiting for that switch that everyone is talking about.  Not sure if I need to increase the dose or ride it out. I feel terrible right now.  I meditate and try breathing excercises, but I still feel awful.  I need some reassurance please..."
