"I was on Wellbutrin, Prozac and Zoloft (trying each per my doctors orders, waiting about 6 weeks, repeat with next) for anxiety.  I stopped even trying &quot;instant&quot; anti-anxiety drugs (Xanax, Valium) years ago because they &quot;zombified&quot; me too much.

Cymbalta is AMAZING.  After about 2 weeks the side effects disappeared entirely.  I can concentrate better, I sleep VERY soundly, and no panic attacks!

For those having insomnia issues... some people here say take it at night.  I had exactly the OPPOSITE experience.  Taking Cymbalta at night/dinner time would make sleep nearly impossible/restless.  Taking it first thing in the morning I get a little tired in the afternoon, but nothing a latte won&#039;t fix.  I sleep like a BABY now;  which I haven&#039;t done ever."
