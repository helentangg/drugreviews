"I have been on 100mg of Pristiq for three years for depression and anxiety.   Without question it has changed my life incredibly.   I waited 47 years to have the courage to take an antidepressant and wish with all my heart I had met this medication in my 20&#039;s.   I started on 50mg but after a two months reluctantly headed up to 100 ... my reservations were for nothing ... this medication has worked beautifully for me.   I did have side effects in the first few weeks, beating heart, very thirsty and slight headaches, but they passed quickly and I have been amazed by its strength ever since.   I have had some serious life crises to deal with in the past three years ... and often feared the medication would not be able to &#039;hold&#039; me ... it always has.   I have an amazing therapist who I saw for the first two years but no longer need that support, the medication is enough.    I used to have so many concerns about taking any such medications - was frequently turned away from them by what I&#039;d read as horror stories online ... I wanted to let you know ... it&#039;s not for all of us ... some of us do have great reviews ... maybe not enough of us drop back to pass them on because we got busy with our new lives where wellness is the new normal.   I never worry about coming off them, I don&#039;t care if I have to take them forever ... as long as I feel this good I&#039;m not ending my relationship with them ..."
