"I have absolutely no complaints about Celexa. I&#039;ve been on 20mg for about a month and a half now, and I feel like a huge weight has just been lifted off of me. I spend so much less of my day thinking about things that upset me, and I&#039;m much more capable of just letting negative thoughts go and not letting them affect me. As a college student, I&#039;ve dealt been dealing with a tremendous amount of social and academic stress. I was very weary about getting on an antidepressant out of fear of being &quot;judged&quot;, but in retrospect getting on Celexa may be the best decision I&#039;ve ever made. I couldn&#039;t help but to post on here and share my experience. It certainly took a little while to kick in, but be patient. I am feeling happy like I haven&#039;t in years!"
