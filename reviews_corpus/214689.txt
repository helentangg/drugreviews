"I&rsquo;ve had depression since the 11th grade and anxiety even longer. My low mood symptoms included crying a lot, secluding myself, paranoid about people watching me, self punishments, no clear thoughts, didn&rsquo;t care about my future and couldn&rsquo;t picture one, controlling about food and lost my love for reading and art. I felt fake around others and had to exhaust myself to seem &ldquo;ok&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m taking 20mg and it has been nothing but a literal life saver for me. It takes the edge off of life and allows me to think rationally and focus. Give it Time, the symptoms decreased after a month or so for me. Things aren&rsquo;t perfect, just incredibly more manageable, but best of all is genuinely laughing, smiling and saying &ldquo;today was a good day&rdquo; and meaning it."
