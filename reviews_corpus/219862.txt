"Elavil, good drug but am starting to depend on it... started with 12.5mg, within few months I was off it...

However, I had a relapse after 5 months of abruptly tapering off,  which was terrible, like I was going to pass out in minutes. 
Now, I am on 100mg but it seems I need to increase the dosage because I have a hodgepodge of headaches and balance issues..
Sleep as been wonderful regardless of mentioned symptoms...
 Is this feeling normal and will I need to increase it...????"
