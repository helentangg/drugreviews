"I was prescribed Cymbalta 20mg @1/day, first thing in the morning for severe sciatic pain.  After about 3 days I experienced considerable relief in my pain and stays away until around 8-8:30 PM.  What I don&#039;t like is the constant sweating. I can be sitting still and start to sweat. It&#039;s all facial sweating and it can last for hours. I spoke with my doctor about it and she prescribed Wellbutrin to be taken with the Cymbalta. I tried it for a few days and that gave me diarrhea so I opted to deal with the sweats. Other side effect is muscle or involuntary jerking. Especially when I&#039;m lying still in bed. I just wish big pharma could invent a pill that doesn&#039;t have so many side effects and just do what it&#039;s designed to do."
