"Zoloft has helped me tremendously! I am going on week 6. I kept going on the Internet reading the terrible side effects. I kept putting it off even though my sister in law is a pharmacist.  
I was scared. Terified. I&#039;m in my 40s very fit.  I kept thinking I would feel better. I thought it was hormones. I kept having panic attacks which didn&#039;t last long, but it still happened.There was a lot that happened over the course of the months and I believe my body just said enough. So once I experienced the panic attacks it fueled to the fire, worry set in and it was a terrible cycle.
I started it after my friend opened up. I didn&#039;t feel alone. 
The first week I experienced diarrhea three days. No insomnia,  no weight gain.
I&#039;m calmer for sure!"
