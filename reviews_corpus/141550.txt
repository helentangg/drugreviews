"Like many I also suffer with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. I have tried Zoloft and found that ineffective. The side effects were unbearable. I couldn&#039;t eat, sleep, and had increased anxiety. Lexapro has helped transform my life positively! I feel like my old self again. The side effects are very minimal. I saw results the first week on this medicine."
