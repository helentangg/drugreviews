"I started to get anxiety when I went back to work. I was prescribed lexapro by my doctor and started 3 days ago.  A lot of the reviews say to keep sticking with it so I plan too. As far as the side effects, I get the nausea and dizziness but it&#039;s not so severe that I can&#039;t function. I do however, feel like I&#039;m constantly zoning out and just staring out into space sometimes. I do notice I yawn a lot too and my lower jaw feels really tense all the time. Does anyone else have this problem? I&#039;m going to keep sticking with this drug. There is such good reviews once the side effects subside and your body adjusts to it."
