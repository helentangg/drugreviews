"Had withdrawal symptoms and interactions on other meds and had to come off, I had GAD but got panic attacks during that process that I could not shake off despite CBT helping somewhat.  I was scared starting Paroxetine but had a good rapport with my Doctor who thought it would help me after much discussion. I took Paroxetine with my breakfast. 10mg at first now 20mg. The 20mg after a few weeks helped switch panic attacks off and stopped me fixating on subjects.  I still have my senses in tact am just not as anxious. I was considering higher dose but prefer to stay low. I have my mojo back at last! Female age 56"
