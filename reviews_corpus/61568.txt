"When I first started I was experiencing anxiety disorder and panic attacks.  I was informed that it may get worse when I started taking the medication - hmm not really something you want to hear when you want to get better.

I feel just as anxious now and I did before taking the medication, and even in those first weeks.

I have gradually went from 10 - 30mg dosage per day, and this is nearly the end of my 9th month on the medication.

I really don&#039;t think people can tell whether it does anything or not - there are far too many variables involved to get a confirmed truth on psychoactive medications.  I think we are being sold on &#039; I believe &#039; in a pill."
