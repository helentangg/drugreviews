"Past experience taking medicines that did work (Celexa, Wellbutrin), 1-2 years later they seemed to stop working (weepy, sad, never wanted to get out of bed, no desire to do anything, flash backs of a traumatic event, constantly dwelling on negative past experiences, etc.). 10mg Brintellix prescribed (1/10/14) while weaning off Wellbutrin. Not so weepy, but was still sad, had no motivation to get out of bed or do anything. Increase to 20 mg (1/28/14), felt like I was going &quot;downhill&quot; fast: even sadder and weepier, etc. Told it may have been too much at once, so was told to take 1/2 dose one day, full dose the next (2/15/14). Still not feeling as well as I thought I should. Increase to 20 mg Blood Pressure went up from 110/68 to 124/72."
