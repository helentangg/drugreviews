"Been on Nardil for almost 20 years. Works well. I had severe panic attacks and couldn&#039;t even go out of the house. It can be annoying when you have a cold or flu but at least don&#039;t  get depressed about it. Lol. Good thing the psychiatrist gave me that first so I didn&#039;t have to try others. I tell others about it so they can get their severe anxiety helped."
