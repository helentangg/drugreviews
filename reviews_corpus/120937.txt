"Effexor saved my life and marriage.  I have major depression due to PTSD related issues.  I had a really nasty childhood, then went into the Army and I am now a police officer.  I also was an addict who was badly addicted to pain meds for about 12 years (on and off).  No joke.  I was really bad and I easily put away heaps and Tramadol with it. Yep, I was bad.  I was &quot;self medicating&quot; to cover up the PTSD depression.  Well, I did a lot of reading on psych meds and I saw that Effexor is structured similiar to Tramadol without the narcotic aspect.  Well, I went to my doc, told her about it and I&#039;ve been on it for about 9 months now and I feel wonderful.  I also pair 225mg XR with 150mg of Wellbutrin."
