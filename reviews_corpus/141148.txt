"Before I started Lexapro I was a mess. I had lost so much weight, my hair was falling out and I was breaking out in hives daily. The intrusive thoughts and rumination was horrible and don&#039;t know how long I could have gone on like that. It&#039;s been about 2 yrs and the initial effect was amazing. After a while I needed to up my dose from 10-20 and I am now feeling like I did when I first started taking lexapro. Only negative thing I have to say is do not try to quit this by yourself, even if you think it&#039;s no longer working. I went through terrible withdrawals that were physical and emotional."
