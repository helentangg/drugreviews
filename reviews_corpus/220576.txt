"I can&#039;t believe that after 3 years of severe widespread neuropathic pain of unknown origin, I am sleeping 8-10 hours and have had total pain reduction from about a 8 at worst to now a 1.5
I&#039;ve only been on 10 mg at night for 3 days. I hope it&#039;s not coincidence or placebo affect. 
A bit drowsy and a dizzy spell today. But completely worth it. 
I&#039;m falling asleep faster now. My mood seems to be more calm as well. I hope to get off of oxycodone now."
