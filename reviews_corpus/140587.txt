"I am posting an update. I have now been on escitalopram for just under a year and I can say it definitely changed my life. My anxiety is much better and I can do more things. I went back to work and can attend social events again. 
The negatives for me was how long it took for the meds to take effect (it was about 1-2 months of increased anxiety, loss of appetite, loss of sex drive, irritability) then it started to work and I increased my dosage to 15MG which is what I have been on since. I&#039;d say it took about 4-6 months for full effects and now I still feel anxiety but can handle it better. 
Other down side: if I forget my meds for a day or two I definitely feel the effects. I get increasingly dissociated and irritable for no reason"
