"Let me start by saying I should have started on this medication years ago. 
I&#039;m a Senior Executive with a large company who travels and gives seminars to other execs. In the past I would painfully count down the days to my next seminar, each day the panic and anxiety would become progressively worse. My Dr. prescribed me Propranolol to take 60 minutes before each speaking engagement, this helped at that moment, but it was the time leading up to each engagement that was so harrowing for me.
6 months ago my Dr. prescribed 25 mgs Sertaline, this has been a game changer.I now look forward with great anticipation to each speaking engagement. I have found 25 mgs is perfect for my needs, no reason to make the jump to 50mgs. Good luck to all!"
