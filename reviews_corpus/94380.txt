"I&#039;ve been suffering from major depression since I was a teen. I&#039;ve had issues with panic attacks, severe anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder, and just about everything else. For years I&#039;ve been on Lexapro because it&#039;s the only medication that would work for me. The side effects of Lexapro however were horrendous! The side effects outweighed the benefits. After a few months of discussing it, my doc switched me to Brintellix. I have done a 180! I feel so much better that it scares me! I haven&#039;t felt this good in so long that I forget how to act. I&#039;d say it&#039;s a miracle., but I know it&#039;s no miracle.. it&#039;s science! After a lifetime of depression, I&#039;m excited for the future."
