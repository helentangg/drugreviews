"Week four on Brintellix, 10mg to start...upped to 20mg for 3 weeks now no side effects as of yet. I&#039;m feeling better every day it seems. I feel happy again, less agitation, more energy and motivation. My personal relationships, which were quickly deteriorating are seeming to return to normal! My only wish is that I&#039;d found this medication much sooner. Best wishes to anyone else with this medication! (My insurance is needing a pre-authorization to cover this medication...just a note for others.)"
