"Okay with side effects expected- I can put up with being uncomfortable for a good end result...but not okay with fatigue, then rash-itching then had weird spasms-jerking-would wake me up out of deep sleep.  When jumped to blue pill (week 3) felt even more tired.  Doc told me to &quot;just stop pills&quot; if I didn&#039;t like them so I did and went into 8  days of severe headaches.  At best, was able to tolerate low dose, but didn&#039;t feel &quot;better.&quot;   Seems if you find something that works, it&#039;s only for a while- then you either have to find something different, stronger, or combination of drugs. Was hopeful that Viibryd would be the answer.  I would have been willing to try low dose longer but went along with introductory pamphlet."
