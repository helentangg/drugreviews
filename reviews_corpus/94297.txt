"I have had great results from this medication for my depression and also my anxiety. I did not experience the &quot;dumbing&quot; down that I have felt with other antidepressants. My focus is good and I&#039;ve not had memory problems. One side effect I&#039;ve noticed is lack of motivation / procrastination. It may sound odd but being a full time college student, I&#039;ve never put things off till the last minute like I have been doing since starting this medicine. Other side effects I&#039;ve had are gas and bloating, diarrhea, nausea. These have lessened over the past 8 weeks. 

All in all I&#039;m very pleased with the results. 

Insurance: I&#039;m not sure how much our co-pay will be for this, as I&#039;ve been using samples given to me by my physician."
