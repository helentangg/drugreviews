"I started taking prozac in April of 2016 for anxiety and depression. It took about a month to actually start working. I feel better going into public and don&#039;t freak out and go into the bathroom. I&#039;m still depressed but its improved so much. It gave me side effects like lose of appetite. I lost 10 pounds my first month taking it and I was always tired but had trouble falling asleep. Another negative is if I miss it a day I have painful headaches and lash out on everyone and treat them terrible."
