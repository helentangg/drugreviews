"I had tried several different types of medicines and combinations of medicines for my anxiety and irritability.  Cymbalta has given me terrible side effects: sweating, constipation, hair loss, hypertension, dry mouth, and weight gain. My doctor thought that Viibryd might be a better option.  I was very apprehensive and I was ready to give up on medicines.  The ramping up with the Viibryd (10mg to 20mg to 40mg) was a horrible experience. I had terrible nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and spaciness.  I couldn&#039;t distinguish if it was withdrawal from the Cymbalta (if that was possible with the switch to Viibryd) or if it was the Viibryd....could have been both.  That all being said, now I&#039;m on the 40mg and I feel great. I feel like the person I used to be."
