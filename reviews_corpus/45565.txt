"I was suffering from anxiety and stress primarily but also from depression. I have been taking fluoxetine for about 5 weeks.  The biggest thing for me has been some pretty heavy side effects in the first two weeks.

The side effects were headaches, nausea, insomnia and less so, some agitation. I started on a 20mg daily dose for nearly two weeks, but when I complained about the side effects, my doctor cut the side to 10 mg per day.  I took 10 mg for two weeks after that and was then able to go back up to the 20 mg dose.

The side effects have subsided to a very minor level.  I have also noticed a decrease in my anxiety and stress levels, I started noticing an improvement in symptoms after 3 weeks."
