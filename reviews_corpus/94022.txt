"Made me so dizzy and nauseous. Would make me dry heave on an empty stomach and then throw up the water i drank it down with. It wouldn&#039;t make me actually throw up if i ate an hour before and then right after taking it, but still made me feel sick. Got upped to 20mg and couldn&#039;t keep it and any food down no matter what"
