"I&#039;v been taking Paxil for almost a year now for depression and anxiety.  I used to have panic attacks almost everyday.  After being on Paxil for a few months I stopped having any panic attacks.  The only problem I have is that I sleep too much and seem to have gained some weight.  If I forget to take my medication I start crying a lot.  Overall I feel normal while taking Paxil.  I still cry and feel sad sometime but not in excess."
