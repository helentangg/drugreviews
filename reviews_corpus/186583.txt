"This is my second post here.  My first indicated that Pristiq was working well for me after a month or so.  However, after two months, almost to the day, it stopped and I slipped back into a depressive state. My Dr bumped me from 50 MG to 100 MG, but that only made my heart race and blood pressure go up and increased my anxiety levels.  Because of the holidays I haven&#039;t been able to get back into the Dr. but want to get off Pristiq and try something else.  Lexapro also didn&#039;t work and I find myself longing for the days when good old Paxil 20MG was enough to get me back on my feet and stable. I do find that Inositol helps with the anxiety."
