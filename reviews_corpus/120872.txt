"I was always kind of a nervous person but was able to deal with it. But as I got older (40&#039;s) it began to impact me more and more. Soon I found myself avoiding most human interactions. Couldn&#039;t stand in line, get on the bus, get my hair cut, meet people. While attempting to do these things I would sweat, my brain would lock up, I would turn red, my breathing became rapid, I just needed to escape immediately. Just a complete mess. If any interaction could not be completed in five seconds I would not do it. Couldn&#039;t even visit my Doctor because of the waiting room. But now on Effexor I feel SO much better. Been about a year, but the results came after about a month. Feel what I imagine normal is. Changed my life."
