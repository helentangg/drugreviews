"I have been on many anti-depressants over the years. I have had depression and anxiety since I was 21 years old, and am in my late 40&#039;s now. Other anti-depressants caused horrible cravings for sweets and carbs. Plus the medications didn&#039;t work that well for me. I have been on Effexor for 8 months, 150 mg.  It works wonders for me. I actually like to be around people now. I go places etc... I have a life again, and noticed that I get excited about life. Also, I have lost weight on it. My cravings are gone, I feel full after a meal and full a lot longer after the meal. I am gaining back my energy. I am a woman who was so severely depressed, I couldn&#039;t even get out of my recliner, and didn&#039;t get dressed most days. What a difference!"
