"Treating my depression has been a long and difficult road fraught with many false hopes. When I first started taking Viibryd I was pessimistic, but after going up to 40mg a day, I did notice some positive changes in my mood including:more energy, better outlook, and less sleep disturbances. Unfortunately, I now think that the effects of Viibryd may have been a placebo, as my mood has plummeted severely over the last few months, without there being any major life changes. I am still holding out some hope that this medication will help me, and overall, the side effects have been very minimal. The price of medication is still very high, and I am still not feeling well enough to work."
