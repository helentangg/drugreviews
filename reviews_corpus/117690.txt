"I&#039;ve suffered from chronic pain my entire life and often haven&#039;t been able to sleep as a result. I found this medication to often be very helpful. Though it took several weeks to really work, it definitely helped me sleep and my pain has decreased. I was started at a very low dose, which gave me a lot of flexibility to move up and down as the situation required. Taking the medication coincided with some slight weight gain, but this could have been due to a vareity of other factors. Overall I found it very helpful!"
