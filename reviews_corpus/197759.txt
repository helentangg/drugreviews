"I&#039;ve been dealing with severe panic disorder for about 9 months. I really did try many medications and I have to say that Pristiq has been the best for me. I&#039;ve been taking it for about 6 weeks and feel much better. Although at times my sleeping is not so great but the other benefits do out weigh that. I am very happy with Pristiq."
