"I wish I had know about amitriptyline 25 years ago.   After 20  years of taking Midrin, then Maxalt, then Imitrex, I finally found a preventative that has reduced my migraines by 95%. I took propranolol for two years, but it didn&#039;t reduce the frequency or severity of my migraines at all.   I strongly recommend that every migraine sufferer try this preventative. After much reading, I discovered that I have a serotonin deficiency.  Amitriptyline works to keep serotonin levels elevated which is the root cause of migraines for many folks.  If you have tried this medicine before, try it again and try a different dosage.   Amitriptyline at 25 mg only reduced my migraines by 10%.   50 mg per day has reduced them by 95%."
