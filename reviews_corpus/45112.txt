"I take 100mg daily and my binging and purging has subsided by 90%. Please note it took me a long time to work up to this high dose. My quality of life has improved immensely and for the first time in years I am not thinking about food and weight constantly. One side effect I do experience is tiredness, which I find frustrating, but whenever I try to reduce my medication intake I start binging and purging again. Out of the 10-15 antidepressants I have tried over the years this has been the only one to assist without dreadful side effects (e.g. Topiamate). 
I wish everyone luck with their personal battle and know how challenging and isolating this condition can be. Take care"
