"I&#039;ve been on fluoxetine 10 mg  for  a week . I get panic attacks . My doctor first gave me lexapro I felt so sick with flu like symptoms. He changed me to prozac so far the symptoms are a lot lighter . My problem is I&#039;m still having to to take xanex to stop the shaking . The doctor prescribed me 1.0 of xanex twice a day I spread it out cause it just makes me sleep . I don&#039;t want to just exist - I want to live . I hoping to see changes soon"
