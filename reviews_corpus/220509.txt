"Use of Elavil has not lessened the pain associated with vulvodynia (or nerve ending pain), but it seems I can tolerate it more.  But I notice that my throat gets very dry and my voice is hoarse.  Also I have been diagnosed with dry eye, and I do feel that is caused by the Elavil (along with dry mouth and throat)."
