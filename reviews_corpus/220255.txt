"I&#039;m 16 years old and I started taking Zoloft for depression about a year ago. I started off at 25mg then 50mg and things still didn&#039;t seem to be &quot;right.&quot; I was constantly sick and throwing up, and I just felt like it wasn&#039;t working. So they bumped me up to 75mg of Zoloft, and then to 100mg. For my body and age, 100mg was a lot for me to take but it finally made me feel better. I wasn&#039;t as down, but I had awful side affects. I couldn&#039;t sleep, eat, or do anything but lay in bed and I had awful migraines. I was so sick of changing meds but I couldn&#039;t deal with being this sick so on top of the Zoloft I was prescribed Elavil. It was like night and day. Helped me sleep and took all my side effects away!"
