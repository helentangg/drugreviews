"I&#039;m on the second week and I do not feel as sad and anxious. Upset stomach for a couple of days but is wasn&#039;t too bad. I was diagnosed with being homozygous for the 1298C MTHFR mutation. Anyone dealing with depression should be tested. The problem with having this mutation is you have a problem with methylation so you can&#039;t make enough dopamine and seratonin.  Also you have a problem with norepinephrine and which causes anxiety.  Defects on the 677 /MTHFR gene can cause bipolar and schizophrenia.   To help with methylation need to take Methyl B12 and folate (not folic acid)... people with these defects can&#039;t process folic acid. That is why Dr.&#039;s add Deplin to prescribed medicines.  "
