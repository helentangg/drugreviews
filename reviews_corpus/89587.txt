"I suffered from anxiety since the passing of my parents. I couldn&#039;t be the passenger in a vehicle, go in an elevator or revolving doors. I found it difficult to be around a lot of people, I also began to not feel happy anymore. My husband finally acknowledged the change and I did something about it. I am on Celexa 10 mg and it has made me so much more calm and relaxed. Only side effect, I yawn a lot and makes me tired."
