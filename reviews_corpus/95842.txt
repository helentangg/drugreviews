"I started Zoloft in July.  I never wanted to be on medication this was my last resort. I was a wreck mentally.  I was only stable the week after my period, I would get very moody.  My moods range from depression to panic attacks and so forth.  The first 3 days were the hardest, the medicine seemed to make my symptoms worse than after about day 5 I felt the medicine start to do the opposite effect and I was more at ease. I am completing my fifth month on Zoloft and I am sure glad I started it.  I am back to my old self but I&#039;m not zoned out.  I still have my real emotions, I&#039;m just not as touchy as I was before Zoloft.  I can get through the little things without having a mental breakdown."
