"After severe bouts of anger and depression I turned to my physician and a therapist.  My physician put me on Citalopram and when my mind started to clear I was in shock at what I had been living in for many years.  My therapist helped me to define where I was and what I needed to do to move forward.  I am now afraid to be without Citalopram as I never want to return to my old state of mind."
