"Went to the doc 10 days ago feeling quite depressed and anxious/nervous in unfamiliar situations.  Cancelled trips where I felt trapped in case I had a panic attack.  Prescribed Sertraline 50mg.  Within hours of taking this drug felt absolutely awful.  Was in a really dark state of mind with anxiety, agitation, trembling and sleeplessness. 

Persevered for one week but finally gave up.  Am now feeling much better after stopping. Going for a hypnotherapy session which has worked for me in the past.

Everyone on this drug has a different experience, positive or negative, but for me it made me much worse and I could not stand these awful side effects for one more day."
