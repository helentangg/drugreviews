"I rated this medicine a 10 because I suffered from migraines for about 5 yrs and really didn&#039;t know what they were till one day I finally saw a neurologist, he prescribed me amitriptyline, it worked immediately. I started out at 10mg nightly, it was a God send, a miracle medicine. I was completely migraine free for approximately 2 1/2 yrs while taking this medicine, I had no side effects really, maybe gained a few pounds maybe 4 or 5 during this 2 year stretch,  then all of a sudden the migraines started back again about 1 month age. I went back to the neurologist, he increased my dosage to 30 mg. I haven&#039;t really seen any improvement, have been on this for about 3 days now, was initially increased to 20 mg for 5 days previously.  I wonder what&#039;s going on."
