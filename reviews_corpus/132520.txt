"I&#039;ve been taking 100mg @ night for insomnia/anxiety for approximately 1 1/2 years! I love it! I take it about 30-45 minutes before bed and BAM I&#039;m out! The only side effects I&#039;ve noticed is talking in my sleep (nothing major though)!! I would highly recommend this medication for insomnia."
