"The reason for the 7 is because I just started taking this medication and am getting ready to take my first 20mg pill in the starter pack I got from the doctor.  I took the weeks worth of 10mg and so far the only side effect I&#039;ve had is bad night sweats.  I noticed a difference almost right away in taking this medication.  Things didn&#039;t seem so bleak, I stopped crying and started laughing and smiling again. I have a LOT of energy, and feel like doing things again. I am hopeful, starting the 20mg doesn&#039;t give me too many more side effects because as of right now I am SO glad I started taking this because it has literally given me my life back. I&#039;ve tried Celexa and all that did was make me a zombie so this is GREAT!"
