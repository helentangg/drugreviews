"Have been taking 10 mg for over a year. It originally was to try to help with fibromyalgia. I also had some emotional issues I was dealing with. The first two weeks was not very good. My main side effects were dizziness, sleeplessness, some nausea and headaches, none being bad enough to want to quit. After reading other&#039;s comments I pretty much knew what to expect. One day after about two weeks I suddenly realized that the symptoms were disappearing and I felt a calmness I hadn&#039;t experienced before. Not a drugged feeling , just calm and the edge had been taken off, a great relief. No weight gain and more drive to be active and productive. I don&#039;t ever plan to stop taking this med. it&#039;s helped me so much."
