"I&#039;m a recovering alcoholic of 16 years. I was diagnosed diabetic in 2008 and continued drinking until May 7th 2017. Unfortunately my addiction had caused a lot of damage to my body that I didn&#039;t notice while consuming 3-6 gallons of beer a day. In the past if I didn&#039;t have a drink I would start to feel pain in my legs so I drank more. Now  after the first I weeks and the shakes went away I went to a doctor to get my health checked. After fully disclosing my situation he prescribed gabapentin.. I had a bad skin burring reaction after a few weeks and my legs and feet were like lighting storms of pain. He then prescribed Cymbalta. I was reluctant at first reading all the side effects. But now I take it 2 hours before bed and the pain is gone."
