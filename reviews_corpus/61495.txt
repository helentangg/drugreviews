"I took 10 mg for 10 days and then 20 mg per day. It was working well only few side effects in the first 10 days , like being tired and dizzy. I am able to sleep well and my heart is not giving me hard time with palpitations or chest pain. I found that after I take the medication in the morning , it is better to sleep or to lay down. At night it is easy to go to sleep. Sunlight is a good addition to the medication to help me to get better ( vitamin D).  I found that drinking a lot of water and walking are helping me too. The medication started to help me from the first day.  Good luck!"
