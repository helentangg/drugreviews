"I started to take Prozac several months back to get off Effexor. It really made that transition smooth. I take 20mg every other day. I find it helps with Anxiety but, not enough to wean off Klonopin.  I know I&#039;m normally over social and Prozac makes me anti-social. I don&#039;t mind because I&#039;m only anti-social with people I don&#039;t need to be associated with. I believe my ability to orgasm has improved from Effexor to Prozac. I tend to sleep more than I should, but it&#039;s better than tossing and turning. My motivation is at an all time low right now, I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s the Prozac or work. I gained weight initially,  but it&#039;s coming off slowly and evening out. I would recommend Prozac,  it&#039;s not as feeling/responsibility numbing as others meds."
