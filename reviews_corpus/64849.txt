"My panic attacks started a year ago after a period of really bad events in my life that made me very gloomy, bitter and hopeless. All of a sudden my entire being just collapsed, I started having panic attacks on a daily basis and became home bound, then depression set in... When I started disassociating and thinking about taking my own life I knew I needed to get help. I was referred by a good friend to a wonderful psychiatrist that prescribed 50 mg to start with, and some Xanax as needed. Well one year later I&#039;m just at 25mg, no panic attacks, no depression or anxiety and I feel awesome!. Sometimes you have to admit that you need help..."
