- no mood swings/feel balanced(have not had any mood swings since day 2. I usually had them like 4x within an hr)
- no angry outbursts or negative/hurtful comments towards people
- decrease in paranoia
- no longer feeling personally attacked by others
Cons:
- trouble sleeping 
- teensy bit jittery 
- itchy(not much)
- definitely nauseous 
- trouble passing stool but not constipated 
- slight lightheadedness/ dizziness 
This is only day4 going on 5 so i am thinking my brain&amp;body need time to adjust &amp;balance out. So far i feel mentally, so much better. In control,i would say. Only odd thing i noticed was random laughing. But hey I&#039;m not complaining!"
