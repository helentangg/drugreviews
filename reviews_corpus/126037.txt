"This medicine was a disaster for me. I was doing fine on Celexa, but my primary doctor started me on Viibryd. I had crying spells and was short tempered and unpleasant. So I saw another doctor and he advised that I get off - but phasing out gradually. It took me months to get back to normal. It totally ruined a European trip I had been looking forward to during the cold long winter of 2012/13. Needless to say, I dropped this doctor."
