"I&#039;m on week three, taking 100mg of nortriptyline. I feel so much better! An added bonus is it helps me sleep at night. I&#039;m able to fight most of my headaches with an Aleve that would have spiraled into a migraine before. The one and only negative, I&#039;ve been so hungry! Gained at least 5lbs. But I&#039;d rather be a little fat and happy mommy of four boys than the skinny, miserable mom in pain I was before. I did get cotton mouth at first but it went away."
