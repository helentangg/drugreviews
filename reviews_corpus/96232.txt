"After being diagnosed with breast cancer at 25 and 27 and then having a bilateral mastectomy I was diagnosed with PTSD. I was so depressed and suicidal. I would cry and hyperventilate everyday. I started on 100 mg per day. Aside from excessive sleepiness and some sexual dysfunction it saved my life. And here is the great bonus I have suffered with PMDD (extreme PMS) for years. It stopped that too. I have been taking this medicine for two years now, lost 15lbs and started acting like my old self! Some tips-if your pharmacy switches generics you may feel poorly for about a week. My doctor prescribed a narcolepsy medicine in the beginning to help with the sleepiness."
