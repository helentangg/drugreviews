"I&#039;m a healthy 36 year old male. The first and only anti-depressant I have taken. I&#039;m usually quite mellow but when I was going through a divorce, I needed something to calm me down. Lexapro worked great, almost too good. I voluntarily cut back my dosage because I was too care free and avoided even making simple decisions. But the right dosage worked great for me. It also helped me with premature ejaculation, a condition I occasionally encountered. While my sex drive decreased, my confidence went way up. The only bad side effect I had was stomach discomfort when first starting the medicine, but subsides after a few weeks."
