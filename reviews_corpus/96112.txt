"I take 200 mg (the maximum recommended dosage) of Zoloft to help with my depression. It hasn&#039;t helped very much, however. I still get very depressed sometimes, and it hasn&#039;t made much of a difference with my anxiety either. I take it in conjunction with Risperidone. For some reason my psychiatrist seems to think the thing to do is to keep increasing the medication, even though I feel no noticeable difference."
