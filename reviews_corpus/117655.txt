"I&#039;ve been on Nortriptyline for about a year. I was having problems falling and staying asleep. After a week or so I realized that it helped with my nerve pain in my back and neck. It was amazing, I was able to wean myself off of prescription Motrin (600-800 Mg) several times a day for 24 years.  I take 30 mg nortriptyline before bed.  For those of you who feel out of it, you must take it with the intent of getting a full nights sleep, 8  hours and more if you&#039;re taking a high dose otherwise you will not feel right."
