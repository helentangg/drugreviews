"I&#039;m 31 and have been taken Lexapro before I wanted to go with something cheaper. My doctor prescribed a generic citalopram. I have been on that for about 7 months now. I can tell you I notice a difference in the 2 medications. Lexapro allows me to feel more motivated to get things done and generally helps me focus with less stress, while citalopram has had not much effect other than weight gain and still at times I get really irritable. Being a single father of 2 I&#039;m going to ask my doctor to place me back on Lexapro so I will feel more proactive and not like a bump on a log that doesn&#039;t care."
