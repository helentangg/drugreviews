"Having started a business in a high stress field, I experienced episodes of stress and anxiety that interfered with my sleep, ability to concentrate and that began to manifest physically with chest pains, headaches, etc.

The first 10 days were a nightmare.  I had a terrible spike in my anxiety and stress levels.  I considered bailing on the medication and even my business, but my wife pressed me to continue.  After 10 days I started to see an improvement.  The anxiety improved and so did my mood.  By day 14 or so I was transformed.  I completely stopped having anxious thoughts.  My entire demeanor changed.  I am now like Teflon- stress does not stick around for more than a few minutes.  This medicine was a lifesaver and my business is great."
