"I have had non-diabetic neuropathy pain for several years. The pain was very intense, causing loss of sleep and impact to normal activities. I had tried Elavil, Lyrica, Neurontin, Mobic, Zanaflex and many others.  The cause of my pain is herniated discs so physical therapy, acupuncture, chiropractic treatments were also tried. A new pain doctor finally recommended Cymbalta and it was a miracle! After a week, there was a significant reduction and after 6 weeks, the reduction is truly outstanding. I have not encountered any side effects other than loss of appetite (a bonus!).  I am taking 60mg daily and am grateful we tried this before attempting any invasive procedures.  I strongly encourage anyone in my category to give this a try."
