"I suffer from a migraine almost every day of the week. I missed 3 months of school from January to March and failed all my exams because of them. I started on 10mg of amitriptyline and had no effect. Over a period of about 5 months I had reached a 40mg dosage everyday and still had no effect. Still suffering from migraines almost every day. On my 4th tablet now so hopefully this one might work! Glad it worked for some people though."
