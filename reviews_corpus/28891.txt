"For me, this drug has been amazing. I&#039;ve had anxiety most of my life but over the past few years I started having panic attacks. I finally went to the doctor and he put me on Lexapro. I&#039;ve been taking it for approximately 6 months and I started seeing results within the 1st week. I haven&#039;t gained any weight, in fact I&#039;ve lost weight and sometimes have to make myself eat. It does make me sleepy, so I take it at night. For me it has worked wonders."
