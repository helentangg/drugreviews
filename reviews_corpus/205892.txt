"I&#039;m one of those reviewers who found Pristiq immediately helpful for 3 weeks. Then side effects (jaw clenching, bruising) decreased, and so did benefits. I became depressed again. Doctor doubled the dose.  Benefits did not improve, but side effects were okay, too, until I decided 2x the &quot;normal&quot; effective dose with no improvement wasn&#039;t smart.  I&#039;d taken the drug for 6 weeks, 100 mg for 1 wk.  I cut back to 50 mg and experienced the first rebound effect ever in 40 years of depression and nearly everything available to date. Immediately and severely worsened mood, suicidal thoughts, weepiness. Then I read. Like Paxil, this has a bad record of weaning and cessation effects. Talk to your doctor carefully about the  /- of Pristiq, and be careful."
