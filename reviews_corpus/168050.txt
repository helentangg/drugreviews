"25mg, once a day at night. For the first 7-8 weeks of taking this medication there was no positive effect on my mood, around week 3/4 my mood was noticeably worse. During the 7-8 week period I constantly felt disconnected and lacked any sort of motivation or energy to engage in any activity that involved thinking, especially social situations. I would constantly have a dry mouth and dry eyes and in addition I also had trouble urinating in the morning and when standing up I would feel light headed and dizzy for a few seconds, this was worse if I had been lying down. However, now my mood is much more stable and the side effects are gone but if I miss more than 2-3 doses then I feel incredibly low for about a week but then pick up again."
