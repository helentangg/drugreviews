"It made my &quot;down side&quot; not go as deep, but I felt like I could not leave the house - I didn&#039;t want to.  No visitors - didn&#039;t want any. Since I&#039;m a very social person my friends and family were concerned. My &quot;up side was better - I wasn&#039;t POed all the time and the thought racing slowed way down. Not the best experience, but better than the whole trip down the rabbit hole it would have been."
