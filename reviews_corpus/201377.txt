"I haven&#039;t been taking Zoloft for even a week yet but the experiences I&#039;ve read on here give me hope. At 31 years old, I&#039;ve never really had a problem with depression or anxiety bit one day it all hit me like a ton of bricks. I felt like my life was falling apart, even worse, like my relationship was falling apart. I still get horrible feelings of anxiety (most of the day, honestly) but I&#039;m really hoping Zoloft will work for me. The only reason for the 8 rating (for now) is because of the initial side effects."
