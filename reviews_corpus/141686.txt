"After a stressful event in my mid 20&#039;s I experienced full-blown anxiety.  I had hypochondriasis to be exact. I thought I had every serious illness you can imagine.  I finally hit rock bottom when I was missing a ton of work due to panic attacks and endless doctor visits.  My doctor prescribed 10 mg of Lexapro.  I decided to cut the pill in half and only take 5 mg a day.  Such a small dose and it made a huge difference! It was a miracle that saved me from a very sad life of constant fear. Since taking the 1st pill, I never experienced another panic attack.  I am happy to report that I came off the medication a year ago and I am still anxiety free. I highly recommend it.  I had severe severe anxiety and all it took was 5 mg a day to fix it."
