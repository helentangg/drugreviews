"I got on Celexa about 5 months ago. The reason was stress. I went to the doctor for a routine physical after turning 30. He was going through a checklist of questions and when &#039;stress&#039; came up I was like absolutely. Just married, new house, new baby, trying to elevate myself in the professional world --- all wonderful stuff but challenging and stressful. He prescribed Celexa to &quot;take the edge off.&quot; It did just that. Nothing major, but you can feel it for the first few weeks. You&#039;re just a little more chill. It makes it difficult to get angry (i.e. road rage never happens). I took it a few months then I stopped. Didn&#039;t notice any side effects from getting off it. Didn&#039;t feel it anymore after a few months anyway."
