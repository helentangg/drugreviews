"Today is day two and I admit I do feel less stressed at work. I have had a lot of &quot;yawnies&quot;, feel a bit lethargic and have had a few mild headaches on 10mg, but it&#039;s far better than feeling totally overwhelmed and stressed out.  I was told to up the dosage to 20mg at the end of the first week, but if these benefits continue and I don&#039;t experience any other side effects, I&#039;d likely be happy staying at this dose.  I feel better already.  This medication may have saved my job and has certainly helped lessen the side effects that severe stress has been having on my diabetes."
