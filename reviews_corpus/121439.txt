"Recently switched from Paxil to this because I was gaining a lot of weight. But I found that this made my IBS Symptoms worse. It also did not improve my mood for depression.. I will probably have to switch back on Paxil but don&#039;t really want to since Paxil is one of the top highly addictive and hard to get off antidepressant."
