"I&#039;ll be trying Brintellix starting tomorrow, so I haven&#039;t rated it for &quot;real&quot; for that reason - I had to rate it in order to post this pre-beginning review.  I read the other reviews and I&#039;ll share my experience with it.  Like many others, I&#039;ve taken other anti-depressants (since diagnosed in 1997), which are the following: Prozac, Wellbutrin, Lexapro, Zoloft, &amp; Effexor (I STRONGLY urge everyone to think twice before taking Effexor - it&#039;s the only anti-depressant that had major, long-term withdrawals and was ineffective as well).  I&#039;ve also been taking Xanax 3 times a day for 17 years, and it&#039;s been a Godsend (not one panic attack since the first day I took it) and has a low impact on the body.

I&#039;m interested to see if this is helpful."
