"I was having an issue with depression when my doctor prescribed citalopram.  I have been on this medication for about a year now, and wanted to share my experience.  I was started on 20mg, and after a couple months, went to 40mg.  Since then, the depression feels like nothing I can&#039;t deal with.  The other thing I came to realize while on citalopram was the extreme anxiety I had prior to taking it.  Life is so much easier without all the constant worry and stress over trivial things.  The only things that bother me anymore are that which I really need to worry about.  I read a lot of the reviews here before deciding to fill my prescription, and haven&#039;t regretted it since."
