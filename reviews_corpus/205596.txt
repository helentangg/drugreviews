"I am surprised that I am leaving a comment because I dread reading other people&#039;s comments.  But basically, I am starting day 3 of taking Pristiq, and I can&#039;t say that I feel any differently in a good way.  I am definitely a little more anxious and have had difficulty sleeping (night one I had to take a Xanax).  I worry that I won&#039;t stick with it.  

I really want to feel calm and hopeful about the future.  I am not sure if this medicine will do that for me, as it is really currently making me feel racy."
