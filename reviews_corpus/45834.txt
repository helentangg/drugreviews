"I&#039;ve been taking fluoxetine for at least 18 months now for severe depression. I couldn&#039;t sleep or eat even getting out of bed to open the curtains was difficult for me. My GP put me on 40mg a day and did I notice a change in myself - not only happy but motivated and hold a job down a year later. I&#039;m on 20mg now and still have my bad days. Boy do I notice it if I miss a day. It was the best thing I could have done and I swear by it."
