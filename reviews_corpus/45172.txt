"I have an 8-yr history of BN, purge type. I tried lots of antidepressants for my MDD/GAD (such as Cipralex, Effexor and Zoloft), but never anything for BN specifically.

My new GP suggested I try Prozac. I started at 20 mg, went up to 40 mg, then went back down to 20 as I was running low on meds. I had some weird side effects, such as feeling very anxious and having self-harm thoughts (although not suicidal thoughts).

I went to the doctor and my dose was adjusted up to 60 mg. I have now been on that dose for about 6 months and have had no relapses with BN. It&#039;s incredible, because I&#039;ve failed so many times before. I still struggle with anxiety and depression, but it&#039;s great."
