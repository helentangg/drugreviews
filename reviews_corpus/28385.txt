"Amazing! After only 2 weeks on Lexapro my life has changed dramatically I had deep depression &amp; severe anxiety! I only felt sick for 2 days &amp; everything changed I feel great no more racing thoughts &amp; finally have energy back. I&#039;ve been into a shopping plaza, can drive anywhere &amp; most importantly can go anywhere without a fear something bad will happen. The only down fall it has for me is I now have NO sex drive, but if that&#039;s the worst I have to deal with I definitely think I&#039;m winning."
