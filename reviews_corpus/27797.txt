"I have been on Lexapro 10 mg for six weeks. I was really nervous to start, because I have never taken any type of medication before.  The first few weeks I did have side effects (including, nausea, dry mouth, and a kind of out of it feeling).  It worried me but I stuck it out to four weeks, because all of my medical friends insisted that I do. I am so glad that I did!  I feel so at ease about everything that used to control my mind excessively.  I am so much more bubbly and comfortable with conversations with others. It really just took that edge off for me. All of the side effects have gone away.  I strongly recommend."
