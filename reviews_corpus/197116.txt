"Paxil has changed my life for the better. I am 39 years and up until a mobth ago I had been dealing with major social and personal anxiety along with bipolar depression and agoraphobia. I had been prescribed a variety of prescription medications by different doctors over the years until last month by chance a new doctor (a general practitioner) suggested Paxil. 

It has now been a month and I am a whole new person. I have full of confidence and clear thinking. My thought process is in a positive direction and I&#039;m constantly looking for was to improve my mind, body and spirit.  I now have a new job after being on SSI for 4 years I thought I would go to my grave on government assistance. PAXIL SAVED MY LIFE!!!"
