"I knew years ago when I started on fluoxetine for depression and anxiety how it helped my hot flushes (as we in NZ call them) not only that but it helped by fibromyalgia.  So it killed not two birds with one stone but 3.  I tried to come off the drug last year by weaning myself  for 8 months. Wasn&#039;t successful so went back on them.  More so just recently I was given Lovan at the chemist and never thought much of it being another generic of Prozac. But, I started to go down hill, with anxiety, sore bones, headaches and worse of all hot flushes.  Finally I put 2 and 2 together and realised it was the Lovan.  So now I&#039;m back on  fluoxetine. So being Generic doesn&#039;t mean the same for everybody! This should be publised more for all."
