"Week 3 on brintellix. I feel so much better than I have felt in years. I&#039;m 31, and have been on 10 or so different anti depressants in the past.  Zero side effects. Other anti&#039;s seemed to cause huge anxiety. Now with britillex, I can stop taking anti anxiety meds. It&#039;s almost as if my brain were a house and brintillex has opened a door to another room I never knew existed."
