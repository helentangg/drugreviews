"I&#039;ve been taking 20 mg for 4 days. It&#039;s been 4 of the most bizarre days of my life.  I take the medicine around 6pm, feel good until I go to sleep, and then wake up with extreme anxiety around 3 am.  I then fall back asleep and struggle to accomplish anything at work the following day. I am unable to say a word to anyone in the office and just stare blankly for 8 hrs. 

Prior to depression/anxiety, I was a top performer at an aerospace company living in a beautiful house.  I have been relegated to living at home, being a bottom feeder at work.  Despite experiencing death and major losses depression has easily been the singlemost crippling experience of my life.
