"I feel so much better reading all the feed back. I am in the pits of despair from my 2 month break from Effexor. For 7 so years I have been on 75-150mg. My life was saved thanks to this medicine. Tried everything. But after seeing some friends get pregnant and lose it due to stopping medicines, I thought I&#039;d ween myself off to see if I was &quot;cured&quot;. No luck, I feel like things were really good for a month or so, but now can hardly work and feel anti social. I need to get back on asap, although I never was really happy with the sexual numbness and sweating. It was good to give it a shot but I will need to be on Effexor for life."
