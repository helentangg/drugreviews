"I had been on 20mg citalopram for the past 3months for PTSD and depression. Recently have been increased to 40mg. I can&#039;t sleep at night, have a dry mouth/always thirsty and noticed the other night how tight I clench my jaw when trying to sleep. Today I have a sick/knotted feeling in my tummy, eat to settle it despite not feeling any hunger but it doesn&#039;t help. Dreams have always been ok. Made a mistake of missing a few days and the nausea was horrendous will never forget to take it again. X"
