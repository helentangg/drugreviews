"I had started with Prozac (20mg) about 4 months ago but it wasn&#039;t steadily effective and I felt worse the week before my period... it would also make me tired during the day. The doctor switched me to Cymbalta while weaning me off Prozac as such:
- week 1: take 20mg capsule of Prozac with 30mg capsule of Cymbalta a day
- week 2: take 30mg capsule of Cymbalta a day 
- week 3: take 60mg capsule of Cymbalta capsule a day going forth

I felt great with Cymbalta just on my first week: more energy, felt kind of high like on E but in a good way...just happy. I experienced a few days of insomnia my first week which which I battled with Melatonin an hour before bed (10mg). I experienced headaches for a few days but that also went away. Feel great!!"
