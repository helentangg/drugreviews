"I was on Brintellix for a short time while trying to transition from Lexapro. Unfortunately it was just not the drug for me. I had terrible nausea that never went away, as well as vomiting. Brintellix didn&#039;t really do anything for my anxiety, either, and I definitely noticed symptoms of that again. By the time I stopped taking it, my depression was actually worse, but I think it didn&#039;t help that I was feeling so bad physically. If you already have digestive issues, this might not be the med for you."
