"Took with tramadol. First two days was fine and had a blast of energy!  Then felt I was having allergic reaction. I switched the pristiq to night time before bed and took the tramadol in the morning and afternoon instead of at the same time. Problems solved and no issues. After nearly a month of use I am starting to feel tired again and flat as opposed to the energy I was feeling when I first started.  The veterans administration covers my cost.  It just recently got approved but still requires a special authorization."
