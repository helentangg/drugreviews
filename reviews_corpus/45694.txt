"I am on flouxetine for more than 9 weeks now, 20mg/daily. It helped 80% with my social Anxiety, I wish I had taken it before. I was  worried about things without reason before and blushing while I was talking with people. But now I feel more comfortable talking to people. I will continue taking it for a long time. I recommend it for anybody who suffers from social phobia."
