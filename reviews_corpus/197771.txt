"I began taking Pristiq 50 mg approximately 6 months ago and as reported by the numerous previous posts, I also experienced exceptionally rapid weight loss.  The first week I suffered from nausea, to the point that I did not think I could suffer through it; but my physician said I should continue taking it.  I also experienced extreme dizziness, but only for the first few days.  I have to admit those symptoms do not outweigh the benefits.  Like many others, I am much more clear headed and focused. I have noticed those negative side effects will return almost overnight if I miss a dose, so my body helps to remind me. I do not want to forget."
