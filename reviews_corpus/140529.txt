"My new psychiatrist saw me over a 6 month period. He was not convinced I was depressed. He felt I suffered from anxiety, finally he prescribed escitalopram telling me it could take a month before I would see an improvement.
I didn&#039;t see an improvement. Then I realized it is difficult to see the absence of a condition.

Life is good, I am not drowning in an ocean of anxiety. I approach difficulties as normal people do, recognizing and identifying them, then tackling them.

My only complaint, is this was not prescribed  for me years ago"
