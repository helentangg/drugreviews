"Have been on Paxil 20-60mg for 11 years and have found that while I still experience depressive episodes, occasionally suicidal ideas, I tend to recover faster- weeks instead of months.  I&#039;ve also experienced weight gain 30+ lbs, high blood pressure, constant dry mouth, lack of libido and difficulty with orgasms.  These side effects have affected my marriage and self-esteem and am currently slowly weaning off Paxil."
