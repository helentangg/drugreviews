"I am so thankful for this medication. At first, I was terrified to take any medication since the only pill I&#039;ve ever been prescribed is birth control. Being a military wife with a year old daughter and relocating and being away from my family, anxiety hit me hard! I would lay in bed thinking that I would NEVER feel normal again. I was prescribed Effexor XR 37.5mg for the first week or so, and I did not have any side effects from it and actually felt better within days! Now I am at 70mg and I feel great. No panic attacks, no anxiety! If you were like me a couple of months ago, sitting here wondering if you should ask your doctor about trying this medicine, GO FOR IT! You can and will feel normal again."
