"Had extreme anxiety after trying Champix to quit smoking. I was on this for about a year and a half and then weaned off slowly.  Things went downhill at work and I&#039;m just restarting after I felt my anxiety creeping back in. This time though the doc wants me to take it twice a day instead of once a day. Currently on two 37.5 in the morning and then another 37.5 about 5pm. I can feel my anxiety lessening after only a week.  Just started a new job. My anxiety makes me think my teeth are going to hurt and that&#039;s all I end up focusing on. All day every day. Effexor has been a real life saver."
