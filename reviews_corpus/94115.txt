"It&#039;s day 3 of the 5mg and honestly have never felt my body ache like this before. I have thrown up all day, can&#039;t keep anything down. And I&#039;m so weak I can barely hold my son. I found this forum trying to find out what is going on with me right now and if this medication is the reason. It definitely is. I feel betrayed by my Dr."
