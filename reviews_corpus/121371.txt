"When the medicine I  was on seemed to &quot;poop out&quot;, I was put on Effexor XR. I researched this drug at length, and even though I was reluctant, I decided to give it a try. I took this med for 2 days and felt so spaced out and tired that I was not willing to keep going with this one. The discontinuation of it in itself is ridiculous. After only 2 days of taking this, within 24 hours I developed a migraine, sweating, and complete lethargy. 2 days of pills equaled a week of hell. I am no stranger to meds, and have never written a review on one in my life, but I felt compelled to say that in my opinion, this stuff is garbage. Really, really, do your research and talk at length with your primary care doc about this one. Trust your gut."
