"For the past four months I have had terrible anxiety and multiple terrifying panic attacks per day. I was having to take more and more lorazepam just to get through the day. My doctor prescribed Lexapro. I was nervous because I had read such horrible things about the side effects and I really didn&#039;t want to go through it, but Lexapro has been great for me! The anxiety disappeared on the first day and I was more chilled out than I have been in years. I was weak and tired and had no appetite but that is all as far as side effects. I am very happy with how I feel and my anxiety free life!"
