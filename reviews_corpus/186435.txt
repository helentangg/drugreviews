"Love it! The first two weeks were horrible and it felt like I had the flu without the cold symptoms. I am now into my 3rd week on this medicine and I feel great. If you can get past the first 2-3 weeks of side effects it is well worth your while. I love it. I feel so great. I&#039;m yet to feel the full on effects of this medicine and I can&#039;t wait for it."
