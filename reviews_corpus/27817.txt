"Was absolutely awful for me. After 1 pill at the lowest starting dose I experienced horrible anxiety, insomnia and panic attacks in the morning so bad I was worried I&#039;d have to go to ER for my heart. Prescriber told me to halve the dosage and this only somewhat lessened the effects. I could not tolerate this med at all."
