"I started taking this medication in conjunction with Lamictal.  Although it is not recommended, my psychiatrist suggested for the first few days I cut the 50mg tablet in half.  I am glad I did.  After reading everyone&#039;s reviews about the stomach upset and headaches, I decided it might be beneficial.  I took 25mg for about 6 days then upped to 50mg.  I had slight stomach upset and a few mild headaches.  I take it as soon as I wake no later than 8am.  I have seen a huge reduction in my appetite.  I was a binge eater of sweets before I started and at 5&#039;3&#039; weighed in at 150lbs.  In three weeks I have lost 4lbs.  This is the most stable I have been since I can remember."
