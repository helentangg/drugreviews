"I have been on Pristiq for a half a year now. I started on 50mg and quickly worked my way up to 100mg. I take it specifically for anxiety. Aside from general anxiety disorder I have bipolar and so I take other drugs such as Lamictal, Lithium, and Latuda to help with depression.  With Pristiq I don&#039;t experience much in the way of side effects. My doctor told me to watch out for fatigue, as it is a common side effect, but I was tired even before starting Pristiq so I can&#039;t comment on that. Recently I read about grinding teeth as an effect and finally I was able to explain why I have been doing that every day. But that&#039;s it for me. It has helped a lot with anxiety. Occasionally, however, I do have bouts. I don&#039;t think anything&#039;s full proof."
