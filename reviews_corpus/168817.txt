"I have struggled with depression as long as I can remember. I was first started with Zoloft. It worked for 3 months. I felt great! Then it stopped working. Same exact thing with Viibryd. It&#039;s supposed to be fabulous and better than all other antidepressants. I&#039;ve read reviews on how it&#039;s tremendously helped people. It just hasn&#039;t helped me. I felt a difference while taking the medication and again it stopped. I spiraled back into my depression. I&#039;m currently trying different treatments and apparently I was misdiagnosed. I am bipolar."
