"I started doxepin last night and I have insomnia and wake up several times during the night. I slept from 6:30pm til 7:30am, but still a little tired today, but I didn&#039;t wake up once. So, so far so good. I think I&#039;m going to be very pleased with this drug. It also helped a lot with my anxiety as well. I&#039;ve had zero side effects so far and hopefully won&#039;t have any. Good luck to everyone that takes it cuz for me after trying several meds, this seems to be the best one so far and without weight gain too. Most insomnia medication causes weight gain from the research I&#039;ve done and this one doesn&#039;t thank god because I&#039;ve just lost 110lbs and do not want to put any weight on now that I&#039;m at my perfect weight size for my height. I hope this helps."
