"Never taken antidepressants before my therapist encouraged me to try them. Her and the doc both suggested Celexa and 20 mg to start. Doc said I would probably experience headaches and nausea. Within 20 minutes of taking my first dose I had an extreme skull crushing headache and suddenly felt so tired (I had just woken up so I wasn&rsquo;t) I laid down and felt stiff and unable to move. I felt so dizzy laying down and drugged. 2 hours later I was hit with trembling, hot flashes, vomiting , diarrhea, dizziness, confusion, seeing dark spots, slurred speech, pounding heart and trouble taking deep breathes. I felt like I was dying and almost called 911 because I couldn&rsquo;t do anything to lessen the symptoms. It gave me serotonin syndrome. Never again."
