"I had a rough time last year.  I was diagnosed with a terrible illness and it took me months to recover both physically and mentally.  And, to add insult to injury, I was a new mother.  I honestly lost myself in anxiety and sadness and refused to believe I needed medication to get back to myself.  But with therapy and a six-month trial of Lexapro, I came back to being me.  I had some nausea at first, but it subsided within a week or so.  And, when it was right for me to come off the medication, I did it under a doctor&#039;s care - gradually.  Lexapro worked for me by helping me focus on both on cognitive therapy and on moving on from the trauma."
