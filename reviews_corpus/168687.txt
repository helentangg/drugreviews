"Started taking Viibryd at the recommendation of my doctor to replace the sertraline  and buspirone I had been on before. First couple days on 10mg gave me nausea and dizziness, followed by a few days of incredible manic energy. I was getting things done at work like a maniac but when I got home I would be weak and dizzy and very sore. Woke up a week after starting  with crushing anxiety, depression, dizziness, and nausea so bad I had to call into work, I couldn&#039;t hardly stand let alone drive myself. I was supposed to start the 20mg that day so I did hoping it would help but it just made the symptoms worse. I know side effects can be weird but I&#039;ve never had to miss work because of them before."
