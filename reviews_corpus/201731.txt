"This worked in the way that it got me back on track and made me feel like my old bubbly self. My social skills improved because I love talking to people now. I&#039;m generally happier. Low days are few and far between. Confidence improved and my obsessive thoughts almost ceased completely. Did not experience weight gain. No real side effects I report. This medication helps to get your mind sorted and the rest is up to you to work on yourself."
