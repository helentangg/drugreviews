"I&#039;ve been suffering from depression for five years now and I&#039;ve been on several medications. About six months ago I was prescribed sertraline and my dose was increased from 25mg to 100mg within six weeks as it wasn&#039;t making any difference. The side effects were awful and caused me to miss a lot of school and fall behind at a crucial stage in my education. This medication has not increased my mood at all, if anything it has been lowered. Since I&#039;ve been on it I&#039;ve felt absolutely drained of energy the whole time. I have lost all motivation as I&#039;m too tired. I feel emotionally numb. "
