"My doctor noticed that the other medication that I was on was not working well and had me start Brintellix (10 mg per day) from samples he had. There was a direct transition from the other medicine to this one - no tapering off or anything like that. After just a few days, the medicine and I apparently agreed that it would work for me. The side effects that I have are mild headache and sometimes loose stool - to be polite. I&#039;m excited about this one. Big differences in a short time."
