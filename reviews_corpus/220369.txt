"I was prescribed this medication for insomnia and depression. I suffer from Lupus, Hashimoto&#039;s disease, fibromyalgia, CFS and C-PTSD. 
I&quot;ve been on it for about four weeks. I&#039;ve noticed a significant drop in pain on many days than not. I sleep a solid eight to nine hours a night. I&#039;ve noticed that I&#039;m calmer, but I&#039;m on a very low dose of 10mg, but will requesting an increase. I also hope to drop my narcotic pain medication intake to ZERO, if this continues to work as well as it has. Getting sleep is a MAJOR issue and one that cannot be undermined when considering the elements that contribute to chronic illness of any kind. This is AMAZING. Dry mouth and night time vertigo during the first few weeks of use."
