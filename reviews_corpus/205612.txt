"I am 37 yrs old, suffered 8 mths with unbearable pain. Took Lyrica and Plaquenil for 6 of the eight months with little or no relief. Started Pristiq and Xanax less than a week ago and I can feel all the twitching and excruciating pains gradually going away. I feel like I&#039;m gradually awaking from a terrible nightmare."
