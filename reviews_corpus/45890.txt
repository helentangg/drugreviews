"I have used Prozac for premenstrual dysphoric disorder, anxiety, panic disorder and depression and it has helped a lot.  When I first started the drug, I lost 25 lbs, I think due to the fact that I felt better. My panic attacks were gone and I could actually feel the drug calming me down.  Prozac got rid of my PMS and PMDD completely. With Prozac I can even think more clearly and I am more alert and think quickly in stressful situations, instead of being stressed out and in a panic. The only side effects are that after I went back to the drug after being off of it for a while, the weight loss stopped and I had to watch that I did not gain weight.  Also, the sexual side effects, but aphrodisiacs help a lot."
