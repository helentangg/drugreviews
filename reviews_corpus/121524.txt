"You have to get through the uptake before judging.  I am taking 75 mg of XR and it took 12 days for the nervousness, hot flashes, complete loss of appetite, and weird nerve sensations to subside.  I now feel great and have a sense of calm and happiness that I did not have before with GAD and mild depression.  I don&#039;t worry as much.  I&#039;d give this drug a ten (10) if it wasn&#039;t for the delayed ejaculation (I&#039;m 47) during intercourse.  Ativan helped get me through the uptake. Buspar (hot flashes, dizziness) and Mirtzapine (weight gain) did not work for me."
