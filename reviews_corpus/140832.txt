"Had been on Xanax for several years. PTSD. Was taken off drug by doctors, because of addiction about one year ago. Winged off other drugs and started very low dose on escitalopram for one week. Then slowly inceased to one a day 10Mg. All anxiety has stopped. Thank God. One pill first thing in morning last 24 hours......Now able to wing off more meds. I&#039;m 68 and feel so much better......"
