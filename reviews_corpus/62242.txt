"I have been taking this medication for years. At first it was great it helped me a lot with my temper and sad feelings. I have had some ups and downs with it.  At one time I was taking 2.5 pills and was having trouble remembering things, and extreme trouble driving due to drowsiness. I cut back to one and tried to go off them but my moods started to swing out of control.  Now I am on one and half tabs, and am feeling depressed again.  My eyes are watery and I feel like crying a lot but that may be due to the fall coming on."
