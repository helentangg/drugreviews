"Paxil definitely works....... but I went from 120lbs to 148lbs in 6 months... for some, this may not bother them since the medicine does actually work. But for me, I can&#039;t deal with it! I&#039;ve never changed my eating habits, and I get plenty of exercise. My weight have never changed besides a lb here and there for YEARS. It&#039;s no doubt this medicine will make you gain weight... you just have to choose whether this side effect outweighs the benefits or not."
