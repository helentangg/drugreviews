"I&#039;ve had generalized anxiety disorder for about 3 years,I had it under control until 8 months ago, stressing about money and school. My anxiety has been horrible, feeling like I&#039;m dying all the time, thinking I&#039;m having a heart attack, feeling so confused and lost, I&#039;ve hit rock bottom.  I went to the Dr and I was prescribed Prozac 40 mg I ended up in the ER because dosage was too high.  The Dr then prescribed me citalopram 20mg which I have not taken.  I am very fearful of medications now, I wont even take Tylenol. I read reviews that its great and the worst medication, I&#039;m very confused now, I&#039;ve tried dealing for mnths on my own trying herbal teas and vitamins, Nothing seems to help me...I don&#039;t know what else to do I can&#039;t go on living like this"
