"This was the first medicine I was prescribed by my psychiatrist for my anxiety and depression. While I felt it worked decent, I got wicked headaches and I had terrible night sweats. I also suffered from fits of rage, and I felt really angry in general. To be fair I&#039;m an angry person and I often felt that since I didn&#039;t feel as depressed or anxious any longer, my anger became more prominent. I also felt I had issues reaching orgasm at times, but then others I would feel insatiable. All in all, it was okay but I definitely ended up switching at my monthly appointment."
