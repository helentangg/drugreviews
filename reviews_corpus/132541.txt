"I take about 10 milligrams of Doxaprin about four nights a week. I&#039;ve been doing this for about 8 months now .I don&#039;t have trouble falling asleep I have trouble staying asleep and Doxaprin keeps me asleep. I now sleep like a baby on this 4 nights. I don&#039;t really build a tolerance up to it like I did with xanax. I find virtually no side effects other than I don&#039;t want to get out of bed in the morning but a cup of coffee solves that. Unless there is some long term side effects I don&#039;t know about I can&#039;t say anything negative about this substance good luck."
