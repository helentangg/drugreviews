"I&#039;m on day 7 and I already see an improvement. My depression was getting so severe that I could not even leave my house and getting through the work day was unbearable. I can now eat, have conversations and get stuff done around the apartment. 

I don&#039;t understand why this a first line treatment for anxiety. I&#039;ve noticed myself a bit more on edge, excitable, and wired since starting. Main side effects so far have been, more alertness/awareness, accelerated thoughts, slightly faster resting heart rate (around 80 BPM, before starting it was 65) and insomnia. I imagine these side effects will lessen once my body becomes used to the medication. I&#039;m only on 5 mgs qd."
