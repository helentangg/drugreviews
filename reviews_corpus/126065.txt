"My new doctor put me on Viibryd to help with my severe depression and anxiety 4 months ago. My previous doctor had tried many medications such as Lexapro, Celexa, and Cymbalta...and to be quite frank every one of them was horrible! I gained 60lbs between them over a year, which only deepened my depression. I felt like I was insane with those medications and hated myself and everyone around me even more and began to feel like people were &quot;out to get me&quot;. All the while on those medications I had to take Ativan and Valium for my severe anxiety. Since I&#039;ve been on Viibryd I feel like a new person! I did not gain any weight and Viibryd helps control my anxiety without the need for other medications! It&#039;s expensive but worth every penny!"
