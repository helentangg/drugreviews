"I was on 50mg of sertraline for over two months for anxiety.  I experienced problems with diarrhea right after I started taking this drug. It eased off in a month, then came back with a vengeance in the second month to the point I was counteracting the anxiety med with Immodium.  I spoke to the doctor who prescribed it and he said it shouldn&#039;t bother me that way, take more!  Take 50mg twice a day!  Suffice it to say I did not take more and went to my family doctor for a different drug, Effexor.  I am in the trial period of the new drug, but the good news is the diarrhea ended shortly after I stopped taking Sertraline.  It did reduce anxiety somewhat, but I will never take it again!"
