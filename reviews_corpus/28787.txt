"I started off on 10mg per day, which was able to make my depression much better. After about a week I started to feel &#039;numb&#039;, not in a good way. I had no emotions at all and hadn&#039;t helped my anxiety even a little. 20mg was much worse and made me feel the worst I have ever felt. After weaning off that, I was prescribed 100mg of Wellbutrin SR, and after only a few days I&#039;m feeling much happier and have much more motivation with no side effects."
