"I am on day 3 of this medication. So far I don&#039;t like the side effects. I feel very &quot;spaced out&quot;. It&#039;s difficult to concentrate for long, kind of feel emotionless, I&#039;m yawning like crazy, lack of energy, not sleeping very well.... BUT it is doing it&#039;s job. I don&#039;t feel depressed. I don&#039;t feel anxious. I just really hope that these other not so nice side effects will go away as my body adjusts."
