"Lexapro saved my life and saved my mind.  I have pure OCD and anxiety.  I tried other anxiety medications before and was ready to give up.  My primary doctor recommended I try Lexapro. I started off at 10mg and started to feel better after a month or two but was still having compulsions from my OCD (although much fewer) so I asked my Doctor to up my medication.  She put me on 20mg and I have been on 20mg for more than six months now.  My life has changed.  I have never felt so alive and so real.  I have never felt so sane.  I can function for the first time in ten years at the degree someone &quot;normal&quot; functions act."
