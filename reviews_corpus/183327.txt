"First of all, I was prescribed to Cymbalta/Buspar at the same time to treat my depression/anxiety, respectively, and I can say that I experienced absolutely no side effects from the Cymbalta and I seem to &quot;care&quot; slightly more about other people not just myself. I&#039;ve been taking Cymbalta for 4 weeks now and am unsure if I&#039;ve experienced the full effect of what it should be doing for me"
