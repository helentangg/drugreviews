"I&#039;ve been taking Citalopram 20mg everyday for 8 months now, I am 28.  This medicine makes my moods more stable but I get bouts of tiredness (which can be frustrating).  It now seems, when I normally would get angry/sad/frustrated, my mood slip is overcome by a tolerance. No highs or lows, it&#039;s like I shrug off what is bothering me.  Other medicines would make me feel like a zombie but with Citalopram, I feel like myself. I sleep normal now, concentrate as usual, socialize little more, understand others better, relax more, motivated more.  I got rid of that downward spiral I was headed for. I did notice best results early on in my prescription and it has lessened over time."
