"I only started this medication a month ago (I happened to be PMSing at the time) and I noticed a difference right away! After my PMS I felt about the same as pre-medicines but in the next 2 weeks I started to feel like the person I used to be. I was a content, creative, smiling mommy again and I am so thankful. I was an angry monster mommy and my kids suffered but hopefully this upswing continues because I feel great, real and normal! I&#039;m so glad I tried this medication!"
