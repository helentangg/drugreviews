"I feel compelled to share my experience because I know there are others out there like me.  I have suffered with panic disorder with agoraphobia for the past 10 years.  It has slowly taken my life from me.  On top of it all I have a huge pill phobia. I tried Prozac, made it 2 days and tried Zoloft, made it one day. Therapy alone didn&#039;t help.  I decided I had to do something.  I tried Lexapro.  Yes, there are side effects in the beginning.  Yes, the anxiety gets worse (take Xanax).  Yes you feel nauseous (try Cola and crackers). Yes there&#039;s trouble sleeping (watched movies).  Yes, theres a headache (took Tylenol). After six days the side effects began to lift.  I know its a long road to go but I&#039;m feeling better.  If I can do it anyone can."
