"All I can say to sum up this drug is that it is absolutely amazing!! I&#039;m currently on 20mg. Unfortunately you have to wait 6-8 weeks for it to fully work but for me it started kicking in around the 4th week. I highly recommend you wait at least 6-8 weeks before you decided whether it&#039;s working for you or not. I can easily say fluoxetine (Prozac) has saved my life and got me out of my worst depressive slump ever. My motivation and interest in activities are 100% back and I feel great overall."
