"I&#039;ve been on Effexor for quite a few years now taking 112.5mg.  I didn&#039;t have any problems with this med but have been wanting to simplify my regime.  So 112.5 to 75mg saw no real withdrawal or return of depression or anxiety.  But, 75mg to 37.5mg, I cannot bear.  I feel awful, irritable, nasty, and even aggressive at times.  Imagine waking up every morning for 2 weeks being 50 Shades of Pissed! My personality changed if feels like. Wondering if anyone has experienced this.  It would appear that Effexor is effective for my anxiety."
