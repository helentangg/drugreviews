"I started this medicine for my anxiety. I took it the same day I was prescribed it. For an hour after taking it my anxiety went away and my head felt cleared up! But an hour after that (2 hours after taking the medication) my anxiety hit me hard and my legs completely locked up! I was unable to move from the waist down  for about 45 minutes! I felt no relief for my anxiety. My doctor took me off of it."
