"I started on liquid Prozac due to severe medicine sensitivities.  This has been a lifesaver.  I am currently on 2.5 mg and feel so much better.  My doctor would like me to get to 5mg, I will, but it will be slowly.  There is no one size fits all as far as dosage goes.  If you&#039;re sensitive to medicines, think about liquid Prozac.  Easier to control dosages, minimal side effects.  Wonderful!"
