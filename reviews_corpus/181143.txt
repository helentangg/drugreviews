"I was reluctant to begin fluoxetine because I&#039;d had a terrible experience when my GP started me on 50mg of sertraline. Eventually I ended up going private and the psych prescribed me prozac but starting on a really low dose of 10mg for a week, then 20mg for 4 weeks and now 40mg for the last month. 

It&#039;s been great. Really cut down my intrusive thoughts to basically nothing, concentration is better, I&#039;m enjoying life again! This is also due to a good therapist but the medication has definitely helped. Main side effect was sleepiness but having suffered with insomnia on and off for years, it&#039;s been great not dreading bedtime anymore. In the first couple of weeks of a new dose, I&#039;d have a bit of brain fog but other than that, it&#039;s been great!"
