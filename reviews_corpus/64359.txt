"I&#039;ve been a &quot;high functioning&quot; depressed/anxious person for 10+ years now. After college the depression eased up but the tremendous guilt and the irritability/anger remained. Then the anxiety started to wreck havoc on my professional life. I felt I could do nothing right; thought about quitting my job; I was self-harming. One week I was so anxious I only slept 3-4 hours each night. I went to my PCP and asked for an SSRI; she put me on Zoloft. 12.5mg for first 3 days, then 25mg for 2 weeks, then I upped it to 37.5mg and then 50mg. It&#039;s changed my life. So many fears and guilt have significantly lessened. I feel like I can cope with life again. I had all the side-effects for the first 2 weeks, but it was worth it! Now I feel so much better!"
