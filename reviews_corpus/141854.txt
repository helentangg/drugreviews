"I have been on Lexapro for about 10 days. I noticed it working after about 3 days. My anxiety has completely dissipated. I have had severe social anxiety since I was a very young child, to the point that I just didn&#039;t speak most of the time. I battled with it for over 30 years on my own, thinking this was just the way I was. Finally, a new job and career caused my anxiety to sky rocket, rendering me unable to do my job properly. Since starting Lexapro I am now more free and less self conscious. I am talking to people comfortably and enjoying socializing a lot more. I don&#039;t snap at the children and don&#039;t sweat the small stuff. I haven&#039;t gained any weight (or lost any) and I just feel more like myself. The only downside: tired all the time."
