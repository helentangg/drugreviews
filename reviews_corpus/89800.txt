"I took Celexa in January 2002 for about 6 months. I was dealing with too many losses, I was crying day and night for a couple of months. I went to the doctor and he put me on Celexa. It was amazing. I was so happy all the time. I figured I could handle everything so I stopped it. You really need to come off this slowly. Now I am depressed again and plan on getting back on it until I can get past losing my job and the months of being out of work."
