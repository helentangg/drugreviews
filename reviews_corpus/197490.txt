"Worked well for managing severe depression and some really nasty panic attacks. One really bad side effect: I gained 70 pounds in about 8 months. I was on 20mg. Problem with this medication is it shuts down your metabolism. I was by no means a lazy person, but I still put on a huge amount of weight. I&#039;m off the drug now and learning to manage my panic attacks and depression in other ways, and I am doing great! Use caution when starting this medicine because you will put on the weight!"
