"I&#039;ve been on Zoloft (50mg) for 18 mos and the results are wonderful. (I had a hard time letting kids be kids; everything had to be done my way or I&#039;d lose my temper; and I dreaded going to social events - I&#039;d much rather stay at home by myself with a drink.) Not only is family life better but my outlook at life is better as well.  I no longer fret over the little things.  Heck, sometimes I don&#039;t even fret over the large things."
