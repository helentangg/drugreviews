"I was prescribed this drug for my anxiety. I was having severe panic attacks and generalized anxiety. This medicine made everything 10x worse. I could barely get out of bed in the morning and I could barely function. I was on 20mg and it was horrible. It made me feel super sick every time after I would take it. I would get very nauseous and dizzy. This drug made me feel crazy and I luckily got off of it but I am still recovering from the horrid side effects. Do no recommend at all. The side effects were too much to handle and made my life horrible."
