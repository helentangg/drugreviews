"I suffered from severe anxiety for years particularly social anxiety. Been on 100mg a day for about six months now. I feel like a new person now ,feel normal and calm and doing things I hadn&#039;t thought possible. For me this is a wonder medicine. Took weeks before I felt an improvement but well worth sticking with it. Don&#039;t want to stay on it long term but worried about stopping as I never want to go back to chronic anxiety again. I&#039;m sure it&#039;s different for some people but I never felt better since taking Zoloft. Hope this helps"
