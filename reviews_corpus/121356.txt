"I was put on effexor for severe depression at 75mg.  This got raised every time it stopped working until I reached 225mg.  I was on it for about 3 years.  To be fair it worked really well the first 2 years.  BUT, after the second year I went flat, felt No emotion at all, didn&#039;t care about anyone or anything.  It was worse than the depression that I was originally treated for!  Then came the time to get off of it.  This was like hell!  I have had to detox from opiates in the past and that was a piece of cake compared to this.  It took me over a year to get off of it and ended up taking tiny beads until I was well enough to stop.     If you can avoid this medicine do it!!"
