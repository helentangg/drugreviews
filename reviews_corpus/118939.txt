"I have had PTSD for 15 years, I was skeptical about taking medication for my condition, thinking each day I would fight on and get better without the aid of medications. 
I have finally sought help and have only been taking Zoloft for a short period of time and already I feel the difference. I feel happier and my general mood is more positive, the negative thoughts have diminished considerably.  I have had no bad side effects to date.  My advice to anyone hesitating is just pluck up the courage and talk to your doctor."
