"I have experienced anxiety and mild depression for several years. I finally decided to get help. Cymbalta has really helped. I noticed a change in the first couple days. My anxiety has all but disappeared. Experienced dry mouth and interrupted sleep the first several days. I have experienced tiredness but that has lessened over this month and I hope will go away all together."
