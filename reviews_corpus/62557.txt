"I have been on Citalopram (Celexa) for almost 3 days now and I been having side effects already. I was originally prescribed 20mg but after the first day my Doctor switched me to 10mg because of nausea and not hungry at all (which is weird for me), having diarrhea and I felt &quot;off&quot;. It&#039;s hard to explain the feeling. I felt like myself but just weird. Now on my 3rd day of the antidepressant, I forget simple little things and I feel extremely tired. I&#039;m going to talk to my Doctor tomorrow. "
