"Escitalopram stick with it. I went on 10mg for my anxiety. I&#039;m 47 years old and I have never taking anything before but it was time to live my life without anxiety. I felt tired, really weird for about 3-4 weeks. I didn&#039;t know if I could live feeling like this on escitalopram. Needless to say after a couple months all the kinks worked themselves out. I wake up feeling like I have never felt before. Relaxed, happy and ready for anything. I cannot believe I lived so long itch the anxiety because now I feel great. 
 My advise is to keep with escitalopram because it takes awhile but when your body chemistry accepts it. Your life will change."
