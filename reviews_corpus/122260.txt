"I have been on Effexor XR 75 mg for a year now, for depression.  But within a few months I noticed a distinct drop in my pain levels - as in, not constant anymore.  Since Effexor has been approved for FMS, I have been increased to 150mg to hopefully prevent the few flare ups I have now, and the last bits of chronic pain.  I am so thankful for Effexor - it has really helped me get a life."
