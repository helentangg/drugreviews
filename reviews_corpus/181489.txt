"I&#039;m in my late 40&#039;s and have always had anxiety spike but in the last 10 years my job has become overwhelming to me and I would wake up vomiting and in anxiety attacks.  I had always gone to therapists who would give me exercises which would work at first but after a while I could not handle it.  Found a dr who gave me 20 mg and I can not tell you how much it has helped almost from the get go my spikes have calmed down and I can control my feelings.  I haven&#039;t really had any stress lately at work so I haven&#039;t tested that out but just in my every day working where I would just feel anxiety it has helped.  The one problem is that my sex drive is very low - not gone - but low"
