"I had been on Zoloft for 10 years.  Paired with Pristiq for the last 4 years.  For a while that combination worked, but I began feeling trapped in my head.  That caused me to go off my meds 4 times.  Began throwing up the Zoloft.  My dr. gave me this and advised 10 mg for a month  and then placed on 20 mg.  Two weeks for it to kick in and I found I wasn&#039;t as panicked when I received a call about an aging parent (I&#039;m caretaker for my parents, and its taken its toll on me).  My quality of life very improved.  It&#039;s superior to the Zoloft.  No trapped feelings; a couple of dizzy spells it wore off in time. Presently on 20 mg. and wish it was more. Nice to feel competent again. Must take in the a.m. to avoid sleeplessness."
