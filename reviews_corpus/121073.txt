"I never write reviews but I figured I had to share how truly life-changing Effexor has been for me. I&#039;ve suffered with GAD and Major Depressive Disorder for quite some time. I was on and off of Prozac for about five years. When it stopped working, I began taking Effexor XR 37.5mg. I started feeling better, more calm, less anxious. Last year, someone I had dated for years and had recently broken up with passed away tragically. I was a disaster. My dosage was increased to 75mg, then 150mg, and now 225mg. Honestly - I don&#039;t know how I would have made it to where I am today without this medication. It has controlled my anxiety, my panic attacks and my depression. I still have bad days, I&#039;m still in mourning, but I finally feel normal."
