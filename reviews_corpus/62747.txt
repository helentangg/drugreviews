"I had never had a panic attack until a year or so ago.  It had taken me by complete surprise. I thought I was going to die.  By the time my wife got me to the ER I had already been hyperventilating (I was not aware of this at the time)I calmed down after a half hour with deep steady breathing. 

My Doctor saw me shortly thereafter and started me on 1/2 of a 20 mg tablet.  A few weeks later the full 20 mg.  Then back to the 1/2 dosage after quarterly office visits.

The most problematic side effect for me is very loose bowel movements.  Every other aspect of my life is much improved."
