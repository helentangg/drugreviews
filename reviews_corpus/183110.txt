"I been on Cymbalta for 9 years this has been a miracle for me. It helps with anxiety, my chronic pain, my fibromyalgia, my bipolar now just find something to help with anger I&#039;d be perfect. The only side effect I have had is nightmares if I forget to take it that&#039;s it. I love my medicine."
