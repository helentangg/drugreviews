"For the last 4 years my PMT has lasted 2 weeks of the month. Common symptoms fatigue, anxiety, no motivation, depression and anger/rage. Screaming at my little boy. (This wasn&#039;t the sort of mum I was going to be!!). Took a while to persuade my Dr to let me try this. I take 20mgs from day 15 of my cycle for 14 days and I feel like a different person. Mostly the rage has gone. I feel like me again. It takes about 2 doses to kick in so I usually start taking it on day 13. Only side effects was indigestion so I don&#039;t take it before bed. Wish I&#039;d known about it years ago."
