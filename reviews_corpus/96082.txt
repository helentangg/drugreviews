"I first took Zoloft (50mg/daily) after my Mother died in 1995. I was on an emotional roller coaster worse than anything I&#039;d ever experienced.  I was devastated, deeply depressed, angry, irritable, suicidal, (all of which run in my family) and didn&#039;t care about my usual interests, hobbies, or job anymore.  In combination with 6 months of weekly cognitive therapy, Zoloft quite literally saved my life.  I stayed on it for about 8 years with good results. 

Fast forward to 2010: I was diagnosed with Stage 3 lymph node positive colon cancer, and in the last 18 months I&#039;ve been through 2 surgeries, 6 months of chemo, and all the usual horrible side effects. Another emotional roller coaster.  My friend, Zoloft, came to the rescue again. "
