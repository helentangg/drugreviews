"I have had random panic attacks and anxiety since I was 21 years old. I had a bunch of problems and couldn&#039;t figure it out. Randomly one day I looked up anxiety. I was put on Venlafaxine which is Effexor. I would recommend Effexor or Venlafaxine for people who have anxiety. Yes every medicine has its downsides but there are more upside to this medicine then there are down to me. But one thing I will agree with everybody else is that the withdrawals are completely hell compared to anything that you have ever seen. But on the upside it help for the lot of problems that come with anxiety. Also it is hard to sleep on but that&#039;s fine I would rather not be able to sleep so well then be freaking out all the time."
