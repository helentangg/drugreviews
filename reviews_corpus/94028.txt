"Lots of nausea after moving from 5mg to 10mg. Days and days of headache and nausea, did get a zofran RX and I feel much better! I believe this med is doing a good job at helping with my depression and anxiety. Just came off of Prozac after 10 years and I&#039;m pretty happy with the results of Trintellix so far, 3 weeks in!  Had to work the much hated job at work today - front desk.....easiest day I&#039;ve had up front in years, I believe due to new Trintellix....very promising!"
