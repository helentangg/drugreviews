"I was put on citalopram when I was 9 years old, and I am now 25. It was prescribed to me to help with panic attacks, OCD, and a phobia. According to my parents, the medication was effective within a week. I am not really sure if I have ever experienced side effects because of how young I was when I started. Citalopram greatly helps suppress panic attacks and intrusive thoughts for me. Instead of having panic attacks every day, now I only have them once every few months.
Along with this medication, I also spent over a decade in therapy.
Attempts to stop taking this medication caused anxiety, intrusive thoughts, and panic to interfere with my daily life.
Citalopram works well for me, but results vary from person to person."
