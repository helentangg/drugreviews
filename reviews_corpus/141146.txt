"I was on 100 MG of zoloft for 5 years, and went through a stressful point in my life. I became depressed, crying every hour and wouldn&#039;t leave my house. I went to the doctor and he said the zoloft wasn&#039;t working anymore and wanted to switch me to lexapro (escitalopram). The withdrawal from stopping zoloft was brutal, but my lexapro started working within a week. I am now on week two and feel amazing. I am going places, and not as tense as normal. The only downside is I&#039;m very irritable but hoping that goes away soon"
