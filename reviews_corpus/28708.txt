"I am a 53 year old female.  Fell into a deep depression 1 year ago.  Couldn&#039;t sleep, eat, had severe anxiety and almost couldn&#039;t function at all.  Feelings of hopelessness, even suicidal at times.  I was frightened.  Psychiatrist tried several medicines.  I am VERY sensitive to medication.  Celebrex, Celexa made me sick.  Tried 5mg of Lexapro.  Felt jittery and a little nauseous but stuck with it.  After 2 weeks, went up to 10 mg.  After 4-5 weeks started to feel normal again.  Side effects got better.  Sex drive is fine and no weight gain.  It&#039;s been a year and we are thinking about weaning me off in a couple of months.  I am so happy I stuck with Lexapro.  It saved my life. Don&#039;t give up."
