"I have been taking this off and on for 13 years. It greatly helps with my depression and mood. However, I&#039;ve developed anxiety and this does nothing for it. If you are willing to take the meds and wait for your depression to get better, it will help. Usually takes 4 weeks to kick in to full swing. I don&#039;t think I&#039;d still be here if it weren&#039;t for these medicines."
