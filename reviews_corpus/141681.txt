"I was very much against taking medications but I am so glad I stepped out of my comfort zone.  Lexapro saved my life and my sanity.  I was suffering from very bad anxiety which just got worse and worse.  I didn&#039;t know what it was at first so I spent a lot of time and money going to all different doctors trying to find out.  Finally after researching anxiety and enough people telling me that is what it was I gave in and took this pill.  The first week is horrible and the side effects are bad but luckily my doctor warned me and said just make it through the first week and you will be okay.  By the second week the side effects faded and I was back to my old self (before anxiety) but even better.  Don&#039;t hesitate to take this, I wish I took it sooner!"
