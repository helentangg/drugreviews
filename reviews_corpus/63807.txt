"I&#039;ve been taking 50mg of Sertraline for a few months now. My anxiety tends to worsen in waves (crying randomly, constant stress, suicidal thoughts, insomnia, and panic attacks). Since I can go for weeks at a time managing fairly well on my own (aside from persistent self hating thoughts), I didn&#039;t think the medication was doing much of anything. I didn&#039;t notice any immediate changes or side effects. I am wondering now if I am having  a worsening urge to self harm? It  is worse at night and keeps me awake. I think it has to be due to the meds."
