"Went on 60mg Cymbalta. Was amazingly good for about a year. Minimal side effects except for some reduction in appetite which was a bit of a problem and causing tiredness at work. It got my life back for me for a while at a time when I thought only of death. I began socializing and getting into hobbies, etc. I then had to work on issues I had created while in depression such as drinking. At about 1 year however some strange effects started occurring. I would for about a week per month become fearful and could not leave the house. Eventually went to a psychiatrist who suggested stopping cold turkey. That was okay, no problems."
