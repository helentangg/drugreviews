"I just started taking Sertraline a few days ago. I&#039;ve had a difficult past month. I had an episode with Afib, acid reflux, my sister who I was very close to passing away. A diabetic ulcer, and more.
I&#039;ve had several trips to the ER in the past month with all with the same outcome-anxiety. I&#039;ve been off work for most of this past month which adds to stress.
I have problems when my wife is at work or away. 
As you can see, I&#039;m a nervous wreck!
No improvement yet as they say it takes a couple of weeks for any improvement.
I will let you know how things are going."
