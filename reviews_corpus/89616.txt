"I guess perhaps a rating of 1 is unfair, but I&#039;ve ramped up from 20 to 60MG daily, and I feel nothing. 6 months ago I was taking 40MG/Day and I felt amazing for about 3 or 4 weeks, then it just pooped out on me overnight. Suddenly it was all gone. Very frustrating but my original prescription was from a GP, now I&#039;m seeing a psych. His theory was that I should try something that worked for me previously, but at a dosage level my GP wasn&#039;t comfortable with. Anyway, so far I don&#039;t feel a thing. Thanks in advance - the info on this forum has been fantastic."
