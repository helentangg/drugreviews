"First day I took the first 20mg capsule...thought I was going to have a seizure and was having a full blown panic attack. She had given me this for anxiety and for pain (didn&#039;t help either: in fact made BOTH the pain and anxiety worse) I couldn&#039;t sleep that night. I was supposed to try it for 3 weeks before she upped my dose but I said no way. I threw the bottle away and don&#039;t ever want to put one in my body again. It almost strangely reminded me of being on a stimulant (adderall or vyvanse) but it wasn&#039;t pleasant or made me focus. I was extremely distracted and panicking so much. I cried for hours."
