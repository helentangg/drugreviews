"I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia in March 2008 and immediately put on Lyrica.  I went up to 100mg and over the course of 6 months, gained 40 lbs.  I tried natural remedies with no help so I went back on the Lyrica.  I was blessed to be a part of a Fibromyalgia group at University of Michigan and got to meet and be examined by the head of their Neurology department who advised me to try Cymbalta.  He sent a detailed report to my doctor and I began on 30mg at night.  That was 4 months ago.  I have my life back- without the crazy eating binges!  I just recently had to bump up to 60mg daily. What a great drug!  I had mild itching the first two nights, but now I don&#039;t experience any of the side effects.  The only problem is losing weight."
