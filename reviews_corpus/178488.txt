"It is difficult to wean off this medication. I missed one dose and the next day was planning on picking up my prescription and I actually had to leave work early because I became so sick (after only one missed dose). Vertigo, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting. I was on 90 mg, then went to 60 mg, then 30, 20, 15, and now 7.5 mg over the course of a month and I am still sick. Vertigo is the worst. I am nauseous every day.
