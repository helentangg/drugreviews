"My 1st anxiety attack was in 2000 I didn&#039;t know what was going on then I saw my doctor and said I had an anxiety attack he placed me on Effexor XR 37.5 mg for 2 weeks then 75 mg after that. I was on it for 14 years then I got off all medication only took Xanax 1 mg. when needed. I lost my job about 5 mo. ago &amp; now having severe anxiety attacks even when I wake up!! I get sweaty, chills, diarrhea, and rapid hear beat. I went to see my doctor he put me back on Effexor 37.5 mg &amp; I&#039;m on day 4 but still having attacks. I hope this gets into my system &amp; soon because it helped me before and I know it will again. No one knows why I get them but I&#039;ve tried hypnosis, etc . &amp; nothing helps they keep on coming. Plus going to menopause doesn&#039;t help"
