"My son was born toward the end of October and I&#039;ve been taking the medication since then. It&#039;s been working great up until about a couple weeks ago, with family oriented drama and moving to a better location (packing everything myself then unpacking when we got settled in) all the while taking care of my son. Just seems like i need a higher dose. I had a moment when me and my bf were arguing and our son started crying and all I could do was laugh. I couldn&#039;t stop. Also noticed I&#039;ve been spacing out more then normal... Gonna talk to my doctor and see if a higher dose would be better."
