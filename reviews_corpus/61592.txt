"I have had diverticulitis for year&#039;s, have been in the  hospital 3 times with it. Doctors told me it was the foods I ate, I tried to tell them I watch what I eat and don&#039;t eat anything that would bring a flare up. Then the last time I was in the hospital the ER doctor put me on Citalopram for anxisty, I had no side affects, things didn&#039;t upset me as much anymore. I have been on it for over a year and no flare ups of diverticulitis. I can eat anything now with no problem, this drug may not work for everyone. But for me it saved my life."
