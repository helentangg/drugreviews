"I started on 10 mg of Lexapro in October 2014. I stayed on that dose for 2 months and felt horrible the whole time. Nausea, dizziness, diarrhea, severe gas, and more anxiety. I lowered to 5mg and finally started to feel like myself. Long story short, I raised back up to 10 mg in April 2015 and haven&#039;t felt this good in years. Most all side effects gone. I have it a 10 because I couldn&#039;t hardly leave my house before. I&#039;m finally living again. It is a process, but don&#039;t quit and don&#039;t give up. Its worth the results to stick with it."
