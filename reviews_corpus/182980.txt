"I took this for both anxiety and pain.  It did not work as well as Effexor for anxiety but it helped keep away the bad anxiety attacks.  I had to take ativan several times a week where as on the Effexor I took it once or twice a week.  I changed to the Cymbalta hoping it would help with my chronic pain and it did significantly.  The only bad side effect I have had is higher body temperature and sweating.  I am currently researching other medications just because of this side effect.  If you anxiety is mild to moderate and you have chronic pain I think this is a good option if you dont experience the sweating.  My anxiety was a little to much for this drug to handle alone and I cant handle the sweating and &quot;hot flashes&quot;"
