"I&#039;m am 35 years old. My CVS showed its ugly head when I turned 21. Now I look back at my childhood and I see some signs. Took me a long time to get diagnosed but was pretty much confirmed when 10mg of Amitriptyline compleatly stopped my cycle. I had been on and off it for years. Recently after moving to a new state it seems I am now always on it. In 7 years I went from 25mg to starting today 100mg. This drug really is a life saver but I&#039;m getting concerned I&#039;m going to get to the max dose and have to find something else. I also take 5mg lexapro for irritability. My side effects have been dry mouth and weight gain. Which I don&#039;t mind for getting my life back."
