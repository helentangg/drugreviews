"I have been on Cymbalta for about 3 months for anxiety. Started at 30mgs for the first two weeks then up to 60. My doctor also prescribed me Lorazepam for the occasional &quot;melt down&quot;. Before Cymbalta I was anxious about everything, whether it made sense or not. Had &quot;melt downs&quot; at least three times a week. I have noticed a huge change, my family has as well. I feel like myself, not afraid or anxious.
But I missed two doses (just two) and am now experiencing some not so fun withdrawal symptoms. I&#039;m extremely nauseous, dizzy, brain feels muddled and I&#039;m feeling a bit depressed/emotional. Now, I seem to be questioning this &quot;miracle drug&quot; and think I may need to find another way to deal with my anxiety issues."
