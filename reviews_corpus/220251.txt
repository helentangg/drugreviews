"I was on Lyrica for several years to manage chronic referral pain in my foot from several back surgeries.  Lyrica efficacy was wearing off and I was fortunate enough to change pain doctors, with the new doctor putting me on 30mg of Amitriptyline.  I&#039;ve been on it for about 5 weeks now and my pain level has come down substantially....I&#039;m now sleeping much better and it&#039;s cheap compared to Lyrica too.  Only 5 weeks, but I&#039;m loving Amitriptyline."
