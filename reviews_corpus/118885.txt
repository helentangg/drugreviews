"I started Zoloft 2 weeks ago for obsessive compulsive disorder. At first I hated the thought of being on a medicine that controls your mood at the age of 19. Anxiety went up like crazy when I first started at 50mg, and I was thinking this is not going to work, and that I should just get off the medicine. I stayed on strong with hope and 2 days ago I woke up feeling like my old self! I had a lot of energy, I did not have any anxiety at all, the racing thoughts in my head were gone to the point where I felt awesome! My old self is back within 2 weeks because of Zoloft. If you are concerned about this medicine, try it for at least a month if not longer, it gave me great results so far with no side effects, and it can do the same for you."
