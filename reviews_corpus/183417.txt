"My new pain doctor put me on Cymbalta a few weeks ago.  I took 30 mg 1x per day for a week, then increased the dosage to 60mg 1x per day.  I have post thoracotomy pain syndrome (nerve and muscle pain) and pain from scar tissue from major abdominal surgery. The Cymbalta works beautifully. I am pain free for the first time since 2006! My next step is to gradually stop taking the opiate pain medications. Two &quot;cons&quot; about Cymbalta--side effects (these have gone away finally after about 5 days)--including nausea, waking up in the middle up the night, sweating and unable to go back to sleep, and some cold sweats in the morning. The second not so great thing is that since there is no generic, I pay a lot for it. My insurance covers it, but still."
