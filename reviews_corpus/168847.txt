"I am a 45 year old male who has has been diagnosed with GAD that has been bad for about three years. I have tried Paxil, Prozac, Effexor, and one or two other drugs that I could not tolerate. The side effects were worse than the anxiety I was trying to help. Seven weeks ago my P doc suggested trying Viibryd. I reluctantly started it. I am highly sensitive to medicines af any type, so my doc started me at 5 mg and moved me up to 10mg at 4 weeks. The first two weeks were great with marked improvement, and then my anxiety spiked up pretty bad. My doc encouraged me to continue and that this can be normal. I had a rough time until week 5 when things started to level off. I&#039;m now into week seven, and I feel great. Stick it out!"
