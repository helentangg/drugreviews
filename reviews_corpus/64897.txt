"I&#039;ve suffered from OCD for about three years. It was pretty bad but still manageable, but then two months ago it became unbearably horrible, my life was a nightmare. I would spend almost every waking hour ruminating about my obsessions while feeling intense anxiety. Then I began taking zoloft. I was started on 25 mg and I noticed some improvement within 5 days, and there was massive improvement within 9 days. I&#039;ve been on it for a month now, and I&#039;m at 100 mg. The OCD is definitely still here, but it takes up much less time and I am able to ruminate without feeling intense anxiety. I didn&#039;t have any major side effects. At the beginning I was yawning a lot and I felt more irritable. There&#039;s also lack of appetite, and I&#039;ve lost 4 pounds."
