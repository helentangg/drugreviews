"I have to say that Zoloft saved my life.
I have been on it for over 10 years but about a year and half ago I switched to another pill just to try it. WHY I don&#039;t know, should have never left Zoloft.

I then started to take a muscle relaxer for a sore shoulder, BE VERY CAREFUL in taking other medications with any antidepressants.
The dread, the worthlessness the crying all came back. Back on Zoloft for about a week and I can function once again. THANK YOU ZOLOFT."
