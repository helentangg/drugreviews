"Just started my 3rd month on this medication and I have never been so happy in my life. I struggled with major anxiety and periods of depression that had affected my school work and social life, I would never want to go out with my friends. I also felt as if everyone was talking about my issue and was trying to avoid me as to not get involved. I would like to call this prescription a miracle because it has helped me in ways that I cannot explain. I was feeling so helpless and felt like I had no control over my life. After the second week or taking the medicines I started to feel like the normal me. I did experience some slightly unpleasant side effects such as dry mouth and insomnia in the first 3 or 4 days, but they got better."
