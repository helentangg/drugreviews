"Stats:  26 year old. Female. 110lbs. Struggling with anxiety and panic attacks. 

I started Effexor 2 months ago when my panic attacks and anxiety got out of control and I tried to overdose on pain medication.  I am extremely against drugs and it took a lot of convincing on my doctors end to get me on them. I read reviews and got scared away. I wish I hadn&#039;t. 

I started off with a 37.5 dosage. My initial side effect was losing weight/ my fever appetite. I&#039;m a petite girl but I love to eat. I supplemented this by drinking protein shakes and started working out. I am back to my normal weight now.  A month later went up to 75mg. Absolutely no side effects. Anxiety is much better and no more panic attacks. Also, my sex life wasn&#039;t effected at all."
