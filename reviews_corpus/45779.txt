"I am a 46 year old male. In 1988 I was going through a very serious bout with anxiety and depression. Luckily - there was a place called Freedom From Fear on Staten Island that was able to counsel me (free of charge, as was affiliated with Columbia University), and a doctor there prescribed for me a new drug that was just approved and available...Prozac. I took it for eight months or so and recovered - so much so that it helped me deal with the tragedy of my mother dying only a year later. Yes, this medicine saved my life. This is are the reason I am here right now. I only took the medicine for that eight months, and slowly got off it. Here I am 20 years later, totally fine!"
