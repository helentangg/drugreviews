"Overall, Zoloft is a good drug. I have taken it for a few years now and have had no side effects. It helps with my depression, but still struggle with an occasional panic attack. I am on a higher dose than most people, 100 mg, and might have to go higher or switch to something else, I would recommend it for mild anxiety and depression"
