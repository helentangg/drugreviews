"I switched from Lexapro to Zoloft when we were trying to conceive as it&#039;s preferred for breastfeeding. Although I actually stopped cold turkey when I got pregnant and was fine. I didn&#039;t experience any major side effects from this though. I don&#039;t think it worked quite as well as Lexapro for anxiety but it did the job."
