"It&rsquo;s now six months since my psychiatrist switched me to 150mg daily of this drug from 40mg Escitalopram, which had worked for me but quite suddenly ceased to be effective - so much so that I became intent on suicide. Instantly, I became a zombie &ndash; constantly exhausted, irritable, unable to concentrate, loss of sexual function and basically subsisting from day to day. Whilst I now felt too lethargic to even contemplate suicide, my doctor thought these side-effects were unusual and so we tried halving the dosage, but 75mg proved inadequate and just made me feel wired. Since adjusting the dosage to 112.5mg, however, I feel so much better and all of the initial side-effects have since abated, so for me, getting the dosage right was crucial."
