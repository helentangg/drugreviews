"I suffered from Chronic Tension Headaches that occurred at least once a day, usually more, and lasted over an hour each, as a result of extremely tight neck /shoulder muscles. No amount of physio or chiropractor visits had helped and I was at a loss as it was genuinely ruining my personal and working life. I was prescribed amitriptyline by my GP due to its muscle relaxant capabilities and ever since then the headaches have been cut by nearly 90%, to the point where I now notice if I have one compared to before where I noticed if I didn&#039;t (!). If you suffer from the same, I would suggest talking to your doctor about their use for treating chronic headaches."
