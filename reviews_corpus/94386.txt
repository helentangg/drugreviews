"I have been taken 10 mg for 3 weeks. I have taken other anti depressants before with very little to no help. With this one I feel a lot better, I have more energy, I can focus and concentrate better. My mind is clearer than it has been for a long time and I am happier. So far I have no side effects besides I am a little constipated."
