"I had my 2nd baby 5 months ago and was having postpartum depression symptoms that turned into extreme anxiety. I was always irritated and very short tempered. My 8 year old had to hear me screaming and fighting with my husband and I felt so bad for her. 
I finally made it to the doctor and was prescribed prozac. It is literally saving my life!! I feel happier and less stressed. I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s making me tired since I have an infant and I&#039;m tired anyway. Although it&#039;s been a short time that I&#039;m taking it, I definitely feel the difference!"
