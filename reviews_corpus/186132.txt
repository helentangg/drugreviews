"Fixed one problem, made another worse! My 14 years old child, has had seasonal depression and social anxiety. Her doctor said it would help with the anxiety too but it has left her always shaking uncontrollably and feeling more jittery and anxious than ever! It has helped the depression, she can go to school with a bit more ease and it&#039;ll keep her from throwing herself out a window. But her general ability to function is about the same because now she is too anxious instead of too sad."
