"I started at 50 mg because of post partum depression and at first, I didn&#039;t experience hardly any side effects. After 2 weeks, I went to 2 of 50 mg and felt more energized. However,  after a couple months my dr switched me to 100 tablets and I became extremely irritable, jittery, had alot of mood swings and ended up in the er for trying to commit suicide. The dr told me this was normal and to just stick with it. She even wanted to have me go up to 200 mg. So, I tried to wait it out. It continued to get worse.  I started having rage towards my husband and acting out with agression which Is not the kind of person I am.I ended up having tests done which showed I have a vitamin D deficiency and began taking vitamin d3. I&#039;m so done with zoloft"
