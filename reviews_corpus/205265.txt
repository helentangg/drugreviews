"I have been on pretty much every antidepressant that is out there.  Nothing has really helped and the few times I felt a slight improvement in my condition, the side effects outweighed the benefits.  Pristiq has been totally different.  Within a week of starting it I see a positive change.  My overall mood is better, I have more energy, and I am more productive.  Also, when my mood does take a dip, it seems that the &quot;bottom&quot; has been raised.  In other words, the lows aren&#039;t as low as they once were.  I have only been on it a couple of weeks and I am told that I still may not be experiencing the full benefit, which is great considering how much better I already feel.  No side effects whatsoever.  Very grateful for this medication."
