"I havent had a single panic attack since starting this drug which has been a MIRACLE. It was rough to get on it, like having the flu, but so worth it. I had GI side effects for about another two weeks but then those disappeared too. I have no bad side effects now. My default mood has returned to pretty-happy and things I couldn&#039;t do because of OCD, I can do now. I think this might be the one! I only gave it a 9 because I&#039;ve been picking my scalp nonstop since about a month on it, but not sure if its because of effexor or not."
