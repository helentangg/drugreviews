"When I started Zoloft I had tremors.  My initial dose was 100mg, but after a few months I still had issues with anger and sadness.  My dose was increased to 150 mg and I seemed to be doing better.  My sad thoughts went away.  I had no desire for sex at all.  I still felt like I could sleep all day and all night every day.  I just recently switched to Wellbutrin XL.  It was hard on me coming down from the Zoloft.  I became more sad, depressed, angry, hostile.  A couple of times I had suicidal thoughts (didn&#039;t have before or while taking Zoloft).  Pros no weight gain with Zoloft.  Cons had to cut back on my caffeine, no sex drive at all, and just didn&#039;t quite work good enough for me."
