"I fired my doctor for switching me to Brintellix and saying it had no side effects. I don&#039;t know if he was outright lying or just believing whatever the drug company said. Either way he proved himself incompetent. Brintellix has terrible side effects. I was only taking 5mg a day and it&#039;s the worst drug I ever took."
