"I was prescribed 50mg of sertraline due to panic attacks and general anxiety. The first 2-3 weeks were almost unbearable (increased anxiety, insomnia and nausea) but slowly but surely after about a month I started to feel like I could finally relax. I would not recommend coming off this medication instantly-I tried it and I had horrible withdrawal symptoms so now I&#039;m on 25mg every other day and it&#039;s worked out great for me! Stick through the bad times because it&#039;s so worth it!"
