"I have been on citalopram (generic of Celexa) for just under two months now. At first, my anxiety was worse which my doc said was to be expected. After about 4 weeks, I started to notice a slight difference. The only side effects I have noticed are that I am fatigued and loss of appetite. It is a huuuuge struggle for me to eat. I make myself so I don&#039;t starve and mess up my metabolism, but it&#039;s a chore. Other than that, I really like the rx and would recommend it. I have tried zoloft and prozac- of the three, I like citalopram most."
