"I suffered depression and anxiety at a young age due to a stuttering problem but I never knew at that time what caused it.  I went to a Dr. at the age of 22 and he put me on Pamelor.  I was afraid to take it but I did.  The first few days it made me feel weird.  I felt like a zombie at first for maybe 3 days but then it went away.  In 6 weeks my depression was gone and I felt like a normal person.  I was normal.  I think my does at one point was 100 which is moderate.  People need to know that this type of med takes 6-8 weeks to work and when it does its like a fog has lifted, for me at least.  You  have to be careful with weight gain because it does increase your appetite. It helped me sleep at night.  6-8 weeks to work."
