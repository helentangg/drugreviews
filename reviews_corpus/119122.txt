"I have been taking Zoloft for two weeks now and feel remarkably better. Very mellow. I am also sleeping much better and waking more refreshed. In conjunction with the Zoloft, I was also prescribed Clorazepate.  This combination is working very well for me. I have even had a few giddy moments and that has not happened in a very long time."
