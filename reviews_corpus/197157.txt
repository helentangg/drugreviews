"I have only been on this medication for 3 days. I have had really bad nausea, however I can&#039;t believe the difference I feel so quickly. I am about to be a father and I&#039;m really hoping that this medicine will work for me as I haven&#039;t had any luck taking other anti depressants. I got to the point where I didn&#039;t want to go to work and I would make excuses but actually it was because I was too scared, working as a teacher for young children this would surely brighten anyone&#039;s day. I am writing this review so early because last night I had some problems that would usually put me in a terrible state, however I was fine. I have had problems sleeping however as it has only been a very short while I hope these symptoms will disappear soon."
