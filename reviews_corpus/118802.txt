"The stress from my job causes me to question my decisions and while I am usually right 99% of the time, I still have self-confidence issues that result in panic attacks.  These attacks cloud my thought process and at times have resulted in some pretty stressful presentations.  Therapy, 0.25 mg of Xanax prior to a key presentations (maybe twice a month) and 100 mg of Zoloft daily for the past 6 months have been amazing! I think more clearly, I am much more articulate, don&#039;t worry about my decisions, and sleep at night.  Very few side effects."
