"Worked well when I started the 25mg, but then after a few weeks (maybe 2) I went back to be bring anxious as ever but only now with tons of side affects, caused me to gain a ton of weight and increased my appetite, causes excessive sweating, and a bunch more. Basically I&#039;m on medicine that causes a bunch more problem&#039;s and I feel like it makes my anxiety worse. And no I haven&#039;t just been on zoloft for a few weeks I&#039;ve been on it for at least 8 months already and I&#039;m now on 150mg. And still no change. It works for some people and not for others, and it did not work for me."
