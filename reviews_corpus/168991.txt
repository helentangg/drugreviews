"I wish I could echo the positive reviews, but Viibryd is not working for me.  I have been taking it for three weeks now, as I wanted to give it a fair chance.  But it has increased my desire to escape all my troubles (thoughts of suicide).  I do not feel better except for that I am less &quot;snappy&quot; with my kids and husband.  My usually high sexual desires are completely gone &amp; I don&#039;t want to be around anyone at all.  I barely want to be around myself!  I was taking Pristiq - which I absolutely loved - but it stopped being effective for me.  "
