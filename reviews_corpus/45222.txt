"I was prescribed 10mg of this medication for the first month and felt okay, but I still had my bad days. On my 6th week, my doc upped my prescription to 20 mg, and in the week I was on that dosage, my anxiety was through the roof. I went back to my doctor with my symptoms and he put me back down to 10mg with the intent of weening me off of it. 

Plus, this makes you kind of emotionless, like a zombie. Even on my good days where I wasn&#039;t anxious, I just didn&#039;t have the motivation to do anything. I really don&#039;t recommend this to anyone. But if it helps you, that&#039;s good."
