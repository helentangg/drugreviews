"I was put on Pristiq for postpartum depression.  I had already been on Zoloft but had to stop due to severe fatigue.  I only stayed on Pristiq for 1 week and it was the worst week.  I had horrible headaches, nausea and was suicidal. I had fatigue with this medicine as well.  It definitely did not work for me.  The only good thing is it decreased my appetite significantly."
