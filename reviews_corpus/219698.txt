"Worst experience I&rsquo;ve ever had on meds. The first 3 days of taking it I was a complete zombie. No exaggeration, I did not talk for an entire weekend. It basically just turned my brain off. I had no interest in saying or doing anything. Once that wore off, the worse side effects trickled in. I started feeling weak and tingling everywhere. This got worse to the point where my husband and I had to walk out of a restaurant because of the symptoms. the tingling got so bad that I thought I was either having a stroke or entering Paralysis. Stopped the meds and all symptoms went away almost instantly. It did help my migraines but frankly I&rsquo;m used to dealing/managing/living with those so I&rsquo;d rather have them than than these awful side effects!"
