"I loved the effects this had on me, however my kids said it made me crazy and mean. I first began taking it to regulate my sleep pattern when I had a third (overnight) shift job. Several years later I went back on it for depression while trying to raise 3 kids on my own. It helped me to lose weight but It made me very moody. Some 13 years later I returned to it but got no symptoms relief. Just weight loss, again."
