"Great for anxiety. I find that I like life a lot more - I like people more. Finally got off Klonopan, which I couldn&#039;t live without. The problem is major lethargy.  I&#039;ve tried taking it morning and night, but the tiredness is still there.  I&#039;m hoping that goes away with time.  I have been on it for 5 weeks."
