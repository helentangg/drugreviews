"I&#039;ve had chronic depression/dysthymia since early adolescence and have tried Prozac, Wellbutrin and Serzone in the past along with periods of CBT therapy mixed in.  Each of these medicines petered out eventually and the CBT seemed a bit superficial alone. Still in therapy and see a psych nurse who prescribed Pristiq - my life has completely turned around. I&#039;ve been on it for about a year now. I started at 50mg/day then upped to 100mg/day taken in the evening. CBT is much more productive now and personal/professional life has become not only manageable but fun. No one drug is for everyone but this one has changed my life."
