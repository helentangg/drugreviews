"I have chronic headaches from a head injury and I am Bi-polar.  I have a wonderful psych doc and a brilliant neurologist.  They have always worked in conjunction with one another.  I let them know that this was the last drug I would be trying as I feel I have done every drug and combination possible. 

As most of the reviews have stated, the nausea is significant and the itching intermittently.   I find it similar to Cymbalta without the profuse sweating. It really helps with anxiety and doesn&#039;t seem to have sexual side affects (happy hubby).  Because of the nausea and tummy trouble, I don&#039;t eat much and when I do it is because I am craving something.  For me, the stomach ache is worth it as it is keeping me stable and productive."
