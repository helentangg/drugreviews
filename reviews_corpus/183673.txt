"I am on 120mg of Cymbalta to treat my chronic depression, PTSD and anxiety (severe child abuse survivor and adult sexual assault survivor), and chronic pain (spinal disorder required fusing all but one vertebra in my neck and the vertebra in my lower back; plus severe arthritis in my knees, hips, and both AC joints). I have been on 24hr narcotics, Ativan, and many antidepressants. Of course narcotics work, but they caused me to have heart problems. Ativan is great, but doctors are reluctant to prescribe long-term. I thought the panic attacks, insomnia, hot flashes, obsessive worry and dread, gloom, weepiness and loss of interest in everything would be forever. Cymbalta helped me get my life back."
