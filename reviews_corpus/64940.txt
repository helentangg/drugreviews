"From bad to good. 
Wk1, great. Obviously placebo. 
Wk2 was a low week. SO tired all day long. I struggled to concentrate. Work performance was affected. I learned that alcohol brings you right down. DON&#039;T DO IT! Some anxiety
Wk3 Another low week. I felt zombified. Tired all day. I could barely stay awake in meetings. I couldn&#039;t pay attention for more than a minute. Noticed my hands are shaking. Some anxiety.
Wk4 Better but still tired. Small up but still zombified &amp; shaking hands
Wk5 Less tired but still shaky. Mood is lifting. Strange confidence. Loving it!
Wk6 Confidence &amp; mood grows. Little anxious
Wk7 Definitely better. Small wobble due to alcohol.
Wk8 Feeling great. There is hope! 
Avoid too much alcohol &amp; coffee. 2 or 3 per day is ok."
