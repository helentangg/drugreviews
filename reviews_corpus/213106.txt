"Nardil saved my life. I have used 60mgs a day for 30 years. I have no plans to withdraw. Several attempts to reduce the medicine and eliminate it. Met with very difficult psychological and physiological disturbances. I am now 73 and am committed to Nardil for the rest of my life if they keep making it.
