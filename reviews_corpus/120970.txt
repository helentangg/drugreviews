"Been on Venlafaxine for 3 months now. I suffer from complex PTSD and BPD. Love it so far! Much more effective than SSRIs. Started on 75mg a day, taking 2 tablets. Felt better regards to my anxiety in just a few days. Side effects were insomnia to begin with, shaky hands, random sweats and constipation oh and of course lack of libido (I now take viagra as needed).

My doctor then changed my dose to 150mg extended release, this is much better regards to side effects no more sweating or shakey hands and can sleep much better. So yeah the side effects are horrible to begin with but stick with it! I have yet to miss a dose but I&#039;ve heard it&#039;s pretty hell so I try to take my medication everywhere I go. 

Overall great medication!"
