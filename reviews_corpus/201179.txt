"I switched from Pristiq which was keeping me up at night. My initial dose was 50 mg. it was hell the first week: crying spells panick attacks but my doc promised it will improve. After I bumped it up to 100 mg the hell got worse; panick attacks&amp; anxiety were unbearable but I kept telling myself to stick with it. So, I did until the end of week 2 on higher dose when I was hospitalized with seizures due to serotonin syndrome. Still taking Ativan 1 mg every 5-6 hours for seizures. Not a good experience."
