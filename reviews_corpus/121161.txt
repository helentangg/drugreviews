"I&#039;ve read that this stuff isn&#039;t as bad as some of the others. This is my first time on anxiety of meds, and I&#039;ll admit, I do not like it at all. The only pro for me is it helps me sleep better at night. But theres been more cons for me. It makes me nauseous with hunger which makes me more irritable. Once every few day, I&#039;ll be sent into a tunnel vision spell which varies on its length of time. And its reduced my ability to perform well in bed. All in all, its not the worst of the side effects, it still feels like hell to me, so I&#039;m going to work on getting off of them"
