"I was on Zoloft for about 5 years. Before that I was on Effexor and Paxil which I did not tolerate well due to the half life. Zoloft was good but after several years I developed side effects. Tremor, jaw clenching, weight gain, sexual dysfunction...I weaned myself off of all meds which was really hard. It&#039;s been nearly a year and I&#039;m ready to go back on something. I&#039;ve tried natural therapies for SADD, PMDD, depression, anxiety and it&#039;s not working."
