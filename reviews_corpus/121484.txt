"I was given Effexor after Lexapro stopped helping me.  I was on it approx 1 year.  But what I know now, that I wish I would have known then.....the withdrawals are horrible!!!  I am dizzy all the time, feel like the room is spinning.  Pharmacist said this could last up to 3 months.  I went off of it very slowly!  I have been without it for about a month now.  I have never been an addict of any kind, but I feel like one with this.  I know that taking more will make these side effects go away, and I think about this pill all day every day.  PLEASE research before you start this medication.  I would not wish this on my worst enemy!!"
