"I have been taking Lexapro 20mg daily for 4 years now. Works great on my anxiety. Side effects: better concentration skills for work, lower sex drive but still works, normal appetite, if I miss to many days I lose some of my word memory abilities and a short vocabulary until I get my doses back on a daily regimen. I do have trouble going to sleep but sleep well when I finally get to sleep."
