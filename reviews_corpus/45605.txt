"I am extremely sensitive to medications, even over the counter herbal supplements, I can&#039;t take them. I had a lot going on in my life and started having anxiety attacks. I started taking 5mg of Prozac (cutting 10mg tablets in half). I noticed a change almost immediately. I feel much more relaxed, happy, I don&#039;t dwell on things that I might have in the past, I let things roll off my back more easily, and no more anxiety attacks. I&#039;m more outgoing (I have somewhat of an introverted personality), I&#039;m more patient and enjoy getting out and doing things more. I was afraid of gaining weight so I put off trying an antidepressant for a long time. Its been a month and a half and I&#039;ve never felt better in my life."
