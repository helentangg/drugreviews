"I have been depressed and not getting sleep at all. After I had my first baby I took Xanax didn&#039;t help finally I told my doctor I need some medicine at least for sleep and he prescribed Elavil and it works for all of my symptoms, depression, anxiety and I sleep like a baby. 50mg at bedtime, try it - it is old medicine but it helps."
