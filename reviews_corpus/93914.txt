"After trying just about every other medicine out there, this has, by far, been the most effective from an emotional, cognitive, and mental standpoint; however, I am sad to say that I have made the decision to discontinue due to weight gain (15 pounds-ish).  I gained weight when I first started the medication at 5mg (also had a severe rash on my stomach), with the weight-gain increasing almost immediately after jumping up to 10 mg.  The weight gain is the only reason that I am discontinuing.  (Some FYI&#039;s.  I must take this medicine with food or I will be sick.  I also take it right before bed as it makes me tired, and also take Lamictal, Trazadone, Buspar, and Ritalin)."
