"I have tried all the atypicals, tryciclics, SSRI&#039;s, SNRI&#039;s, and anything else they threw at me. The ONLY DRUG that helped was Parnate. The Walgreen&#039;s sheet said it would kick in within 1-24 hours. After the first pill I thought my mind had snapped. The abrupt cessation of all pain was so intense I was stunned. It has been ten years and I am still in love with this drug."
