"Im 22 on Day 5 of 25mg Zoloft.  tried Prozac before and it made me feel numb kind of zombie like.  Zoloft is helping my mood, but I cant sleep at all, if I do manage to fall asleep I wake up an hour later.  I clench my teeth and constantly need to move my legs at night.  feel slightly confused at times. im hoping these side effects go away"
