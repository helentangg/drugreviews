"I have had a good experience with Paxil thus far, and I wanted to put it out there because I think it&#039;s usually the bad experiences that prompt folks to write these reviews! I&#039;d tried other SSRIs (Wellbutrin, Lexapro, Celexa), with bad results, so I was hesitant. I started on 10 mg/day for two weeks then went to 20mg. At first I didn&#039;t notice much, but by the third week my obsessive compulsive disorder and anxiety were greatly quelled. I feel a general sense of well-being and satisfaction with life, yet I&#039;m still productive/creative/ME. No ill side effects whatsoever. I hear the withdrawal is a bear, and I&#039;ll cross that bridge when I get there, but, so far so good."
