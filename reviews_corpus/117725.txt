"For several years I have lived with spine and disc-damage. I have been on a controlled narcotics program for quite a while. It saved my life. Chronic pain scrambles the brain. I was already on fluoxetine, but felt I was losing ground. Then my docor put me on nortriptyline. GREAT results. I feel better mentally, and the medicine somehow &quot;soothes&quot; inflamed spinal-cord areas. NOT my imagination-over the years, doctors tried several medicines for this, none worked. This one helped both the depression AND nerve-impulses at the discs/spinal-cord."
