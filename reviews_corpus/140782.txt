"I&#039;m currently on Remeron 15mg mostly to help me sleep and also taking lorazapam to help me through. I recently tried Effexor, Paxil and Tritellix with no success.I started at 10mg of Lexapro about 8 weeks ago and so far it hasn&#039;t done anything for me. I&#039;m actually experiencing for fear but a little less anxiety. My doctor wants me up to 20mg but when I try to increase I get wicked side effects like nausea, runny nose, increased anxiety, abnormal breathing, pounding heart etc. I&#039;ve been on 15mg for 5 days now and yesterday and today I began to feel nauseous and sleepy. I also woke up feeling depressed. I&#039;m determined to stick it our and jump to 20mg on day 8. I&#039;m encouraged by some of the reviews but some of the others scare me."
