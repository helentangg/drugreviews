"I have ALWAYS suffered from anxiety and depression.  It has been my experience that meds often do not act &quot;typically&quot; when I take them, so I was wary of sertraline. I started out with 25 mg per day from my psychiatris.  When he prompted me to increase to 50 mg, I did so, and experienced the &quot;zoned-out&quot; feeling of unreality--not scary--just distracting.  When I stay at 25 mg per day, I feel normal.  Anxiety is at a minimum, and depression is manageable.  I feel fortunate and  blessed.  I just wonder why such a low dose for me has such a huge positive impact.  Anyone else experience this phenomenom?"
