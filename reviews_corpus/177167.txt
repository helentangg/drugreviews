"I suffer from chronic pain, depression and anxiety for the past 10 years and I&#039;m 30.  Football ruined my life, but cymbalta has made it worse.  Not only did I NOT receive any benefit from cymbalta but I gave it the a serious 2 month try and I&#039;m not spending 90% of my time withdrawing from it.  I cannot imagine if I was on this a year, let alone ten.  If this medicine helps you, I would weigh the benefits seriously- because either you&#039;re going to the grave with this medicine or you&#039;re going to have to feel the &quot;benefits&quot; of coming off of this poison. Beware.. because no doctor will tell you these things.  Worse than 2 years of clonazepam, alcohol, or opiates... no joke.  Hope this helps someone!"
