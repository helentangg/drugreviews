"I started taking Effexor XR about 10 years ago, for those last 10 years I have struggled with IBS-D. I would like to go off this drug but it has terrible withdrawal symptoms, and I&#039;ve read the withdrawal can last for years after getting off this drug. When I read that people were taking the medication I think is causing my IBS to treat their IBS I was shocked. I&#039;m glad if it works for them, but I wish I had never taken this drug."
