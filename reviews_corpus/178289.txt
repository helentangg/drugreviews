"I have Stage IV Met. breast cancer with about 2-3 years to go. I got into a bad suicidal depression about dying so I was prescribed Cymbalta. Been on it for three weeks. Also doing chemo so I am not completely sure what symptoms are what. Good news is that after two weeks of starting this drug I did feel better. The side effects in the beginning were feeling flat and zombie-ish. Then I began to feel calmer and less obsessed with death. I did feel like sleeping a lot in the beginning. I added a 5mg Ativan at night to help sleep. I also take a half Percocet at night too. That does the trick as you can imagine. Lately the only adverse is an uncomfortable feeling of being very full after eating."
