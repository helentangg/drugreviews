"I&#039;ve been taking Cymbalta/Duloxetine for two years. I suffer from chronic pain due to what doctors and specialists call &quot; I don&#039;t know .&quot; It helps me when used with diclofenac, tizanidine and hydrocodone. It lessens my symptoms so that doctors and people who never suffered from pain, stop nagging me about a possible addiction to hydrocodone because i take less now. The unexpected bonus is that I function much better in everyday life. 
Without knowing, the constant pain put me in a severe depression and i missed a couple of years of my life. Also without knowing, I went my whole life ( I&#039;m fifty one now) suffering from anxiety even though highly functional.  Cymbalta  brought me back to the world and my family with only mild side effects ."
