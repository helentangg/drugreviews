"I am taking 20mg of Paroxetine a day. I have only been taking it for one week but I am starting to feel a lot more positive. I don&#039;t feel as tired, I&#039;m not comfort eating and I find myself in a better mood. I understand it has only been a week but I haven&#039;t felt this &quot;up&quot; on other SSRI&#039;s, my previous one being Sertraline which did not agree with me. My side effects have been a headache (for the first 3 days), constant dry mouth, trouble sleeping through the night, my jaw feels tight and lack of appetite. I also suffer from Trichotillomania, I have still found myself pulling eyelashes. It has only been a week so I hope I continue to improve."
