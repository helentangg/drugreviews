"This medication can&#039;t be rated hastily.  It can take up to 6 weeks to level off.  My first days of Pristiq 50mg were terrible.  My first dose at night caused insomnia, jitteriness and dizziness, dilated pupils, nausea, sweaty, and a racing pulse.  The following week I felt great with NO ANXIETY!  I still felt nauseous however, ate very little(lost 7 lbs), and had a headache daily.  The following week my side effects continued (  insomnia &amp; TMJ flare up), but my benefits diminished. My Doctor then increased my dose to 100mg.  Since then most of my side effects are gone except the dilated pupils &amp; TMJ issues.  I&#039;ve taken Zoloft(ok) &amp; Lexapro(zombie) in the past.  Please give this medicine time before you decide you hate it!"
