"My doctor put me on this medication when I could no longer afford the other one that I was taking. I was very apprehensive about switching since my other one worked well for me. Since taking this, my husband feels like he has the wife back that he originally married and I have been feeling wonderful. I had my first baby in May and was finding normal day to day living difficult. Like I said, I couldn&#039;t afford my old medication and this was definitely an affordable choice. The only side effect that I have noticed is the diarrhea."
