"I have suffered from panic disorders for eight years. I have taken everything there is and nothing has seemed to work. Zoloft helped take the edge off but it gave me sexual side effects and kind of made me numb. Pristiq is the best thing ever. I noticed almost immediately that it was working. The first week was rough and I felt a little more anxious. The only side effects I have are like at night I sometimes see halos around lights and I urinate a lot more often. But I feel great I have only had two panic attacks compared to having one everyday. I have only been taking Pristiq for a month. Thank you to the makers of Wyeth I have my life back."
