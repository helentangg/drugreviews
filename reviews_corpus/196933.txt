"I have been using Paroxetine for about 5 years now.  Before starting to take it my hot flashes were very severe, more than 10 a day, to the point of exhaustion. I had night sweats and it was difficult to sleep. My social life just disappeared. I did not want to be around people when I was having my hot flashes. Recently I just ran out of Paroxetine and thought nothing about it. I skipped it for about 3 or 4 days. My hot flashes began to appear very strong, as I had not experienced them in a long, long time. I had forgotten what I was taking Paroxetine for.  I am back on my 20mg a day, and I don&#039;t think I will ever forget to take it or the reason why I am taking it. For me, Paroxetine is a life saver!"
