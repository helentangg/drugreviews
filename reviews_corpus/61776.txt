"I started Citalopram to treat GAD and Major Depressive Disorder. I&#039;ve now been on it for 3 years. I took a week off school and don&#039;t really remember any major side effects at the time. It was my first anti-depressant and made a pretty big difference. Definitely helped with my anxiety and low moods and suicidal thoughts. Bumped up my dosage a few times and I&#039;ve been on 40mg for about a year now. However, loads of symptoms are still present, mental fogginess, lack of motivation/concentration, near constant fatique, lack of emotion for long periods until I reach a breakdown state of panic. Panic attacks around biweekly, which is improved from 3 years ago, but much worse than it&#039;s been in a long time. Switching to a new medication this week."
