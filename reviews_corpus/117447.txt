"I was prescribed this stuff for insomnia and the first and only night I took it I had a massive nervous breakdown. About two hours after taking it and still not able to sleep I began to feel slightly nervous and sad. I couldn&#039;t stop thinking about killing myself. I had to wake up my husband at 2 AM to help snap me out of it and I never did get to sleep that night. Needless to say I will never take this garbage again."
