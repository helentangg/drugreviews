"At the moment I am having an episode of severe depression and anxiety which has been extremly debilitating for the last 2 months. Im unable to work, socialise or even speak to anyone at the moment. As this is the worst ive ever felt I decided i now need medication. I have been on 50mg setraline for almost 2 weeks. I take it in the morning. I have had trouble sleeping some nights as I just feel wide awake. It has stopped me sleeping through the day which I was doing a lot of. When I do eventually sleep it is a bit hard to get up in the morning but once up im fine. Ive had a couple of good days and bad. I sometimes feel a little &#039;wired&#039;. Ive invested in a herbal tablet to help me sleep at night. Im hoping I will feel &quot;normal&quot; again soon!"
