"I suffered from acute anxiety and panic disorders my entire life and had no idea of how much it was crippling me until my late 30s. I have been taking Escitalopram for about a year now and I am a new person. Small challenges would throw me into a tailspin of constant thoughts and hyper-anxious reactions and I would end up just wanting to stay in bed. I am a new woman and take 20mg *faithfully*.  What I love about this medication is that I still have the same concerns but they do not &quot;spin me out&quot; - I handle them and move on.  I am not hamstrung by my thoughts and fears being out of control anymore."
