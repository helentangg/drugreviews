"I have been on Cymbalta for at least 4-5 years.  I took it with lamactal also as it did not seem to help or put the anxiety/depression.  I now am doing acupuncture and going off both drugs.  Horrible!!!!!!!!  I tried to tell my doctors that I still felt crumby on cymbalta but they just upped my dosage.  I think there are other ways to deal with anxiety and depression.  At the very least you should find out if a certain drug works well with you by checking it out with a pharmacologist, so you can be matched.  Good luck to all who are suffering, it is not much fun."
