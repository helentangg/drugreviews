"I&#039;ve been taking Celexa for a few weeks now. I&#039;ve gained alot of weight.. so much in fact we thought I was pregnant! AND I&#039;M NOT! I&#039;ve been feeling nauseous, and having cramps. I dont want to have sex anymore and when we do I can&#039;t have an orgasm. My period is down to just barely anything (I have an IUD that I&#039;ve had for 3 years). Celexa does make me a happier person. I&#039;m playing with my kids now, which before I wouldn&#039;t. I just wanted to be left alone and wanted to play my computer. Now I do things with my family, I feel happier. "
