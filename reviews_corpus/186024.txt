"After 5 years of altering my life to avoid anxiety and panic attacks and having tried many different types of medication I finally was given pristiq.  I started 5 days ago and talk about a HUGE and almost immediate difference!   Initially there were headaches (few days off and on) but instant energy and stable mood without anxiety!  It&#039;s weird but things actually seem visually brighter and my sense of smell has increased. Appetite is down as smells are making my stomach churn so sticking with very bland foods and tons of fluids.  Wide awake at night but that&#039;s normal for me.  I am so grateful for feeling normal again!"
