"I have had severe lower back pain for many years. I have 2 bulging disc, 1 ruptured disc which causes paralysis and severe pain in my left leg, degenerative disc, arthritis and a small deformity on my lower spine and I&#039;m only 40 years old. I&#039;m on the couch and unable to walk a lot of the time. The pain was so severe. The doctor put me on Cymbalta and referred me to a neurosurgeon. The neurosurgeon finally said they would do surgery to fuse my lower back. I have been on Cymbalta for a little over 3 months now and I&#039;m pain free. I have canceled my surgery.  I have my life back. Love it."
