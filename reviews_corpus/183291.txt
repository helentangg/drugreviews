"I had developed occipital neuralgia as a result of Tourette&#039;s syndrome.  The pain in my neck was very severe so I went to a pain management clinic where I was treated with methadone, Lyrica (caused serious side reactions), injections of steroids and some other medications, and finally by radiofrequency ablation.  All this took three years and I was out of options.  I read that Cymbalta was good for neuropathic pain so I got a prescription and started taking it.  After about 6-7 weeks, I was pain free.  I found it hard to believe.  I later switched to Wellbutrin and remained pain free."
