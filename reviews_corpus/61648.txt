"I started this medication exactly 4 weeks ago.  I started Citalopram 20 mg and noticed something the very first day.  I stopped taking it at night as at first, I couldn&#039;t sleep.  It helped the irratability and I didn&#039;t feel depressed, however, I felt like my head was under water a bit. In the third week I noticed a major amount of fatigue and my depression again, into the fourth week as well.  Right now I am still very tired and considering taking it before bed again.  I know I should talk to my doctor because the fatigue is just too much, I could sleep another 4-5 hours during the day if I could. I wonder if the dose needs to go higher now or if there is something to help the fatigue. I&#039;ll probably stick with 20 mg for another 2 weeks."
