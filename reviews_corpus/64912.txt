"I&#039;ve tried several medications and so far this one has been the best anti-depressant that prevents panic attacks. I used to have at least three a day, now I only get them in extreme circumstances like when a family member passed away. 
It used to be dangerous for me to drive since events on the road would trigger a panic attack. Life is a lot easier on Zoloft."
