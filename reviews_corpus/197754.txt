"I was on Cymbalta and had side effects so I changed to Pristiq and within a few weeks I was finally feeling normal. I had some major mood swings so my doctor upped the dose to 100mg. I have been on it for a few months now and it seems to be doing great. It&#039;s amazing what a little pill will do."
