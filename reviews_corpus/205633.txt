"I have been on Pristiq for 3 months. Before this time, I have been having severe bouts of rage and anger due to PMS. For 2 weeks a month, I was not able to control myself. On this medicine I am under full control! No more screaming or fits of rage. No more shaking from such anxiety. I am on 50 mg. I would highly recommend this medicine. My only side effect is weight gain. I have gained 15 pounds. I&#039;m dieting and exercising to combat this affect. I&#039;m not going off this medicine for that reason. It&#039;s the only one that has worked for me."
