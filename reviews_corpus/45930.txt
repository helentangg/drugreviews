"I have Bipolar disorder. I just started 10mg of Prozac 3 weeks ago and I love it. I needed an antidepressant to work with the Lithium I was taking. And I feel terrific. So far I haven&#039;t gained any weight. I gained 30 lbs because my thyroid stopped working and 20 of it has come off and I&#039;ve lowered the lithium and I attribute this to the Prozac. I have Wellbutrin as a stand by if the weight starts coming on but I really don&#039;t want to change. I am in control and for someone with bipolar that&#039;s a hard place to get to. "
