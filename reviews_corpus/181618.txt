"I have been taking Prozac (fluoxetine) for about a month now. I&#039;m 15 and I am taking it for anxiety disorder and depression. So far it has been working. I have not been at all depressed for a while. It took about a week and a half for it to start making a difference. I noticed that I&#039;m more calm when it comes to stress. I like it. I&#039;m taking 10mg at the moment. The only complaint I have about it, is that I have noticed an increase in appetite, which I hate."
