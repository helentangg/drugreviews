"My mom has been trying to get me on meds for my severe anger,due to my pmdd, but I am so antimeds. Finally decided to give it a try (10mg) and it is amazing! Usually around 11 days before my period i would be a raging maniac but since taking prozac its completly subsided. Initially,  I also (as someone else stated) had trouble having an orgasm so i stopped taking it. But when the anger came back I gave it another try and stuck it out and miraculously that side effect went away, YAYYY!"
