"I had been taking Venlafaxine for over 3 years for bulimia and severe depression. For two of those years I took 300mg a day (4 x 75mg tablets), two in the morning and two in the evening.

Just 2 months ago I decided to stop taking this drug as everything in my life felt fake and I felt numb to all emotion.

 I tapered my withdrawal from this drug and just over 2 months in, I seriously angry and crying all the time.  The initial withdrawal (first  few weeks) was horrendous, but now 2 months in and I think this stage is just awful.  Loved ones and friend don&#039;t want to be around me as I get angry at the slightest thing.

I just pray I get through this, but it is so hard and I feel for everyone else out there in the same boat as me."
