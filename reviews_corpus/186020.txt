"I started on zoloft over five years ago when I had uncontrollable mood swings then changed to pristiq.  The zoloft stopped the mood swings and I fairly quickly changed at the Doctors suggestion to pristiq and the improvement in my functioning continued - far better than I was before.   About 4 months ago things were going so well I thought I could stop taking it and after speaking to the Doctor slowly reduced my dosage until I wasnt taking any.  I then experienced a strong return of depression, anxiety and lack of drive.  I am now one week into taking pristiq again and havent experienced any change yet but didnt expect to as it can take six weeks to work. On my previous experience with pristiq I highly recommend it."
