"I had terrible hot flashes so my doctor prescribed Venlafaxine 37.5mg. They worked great for about a year and a half until about one month ago. I&#039;m again having hot flashes so I don&#039;t know if increasing the amount will help but I need a solution. I think there has been some change in my hormone levels which is causing the problem."
