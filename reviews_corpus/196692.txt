"I was prescribe this medication for anxiety, and it worked. I had panic attacks on the nyc subway before taking the medication but when I was on it really helped me to gain a normal life. I was on it for about 8 months then my doctor decided to take me off it cause my life became organized. That was the worst experience ever, coming off paxil was the hardest thing ever, and I recommend when you come off it to taper down very slowly because it just was absolutely hell. This drug does help but it&#039;s addictive and hard to come off. Also I gained about 30 pounds on it. I&#039;d recommend the medication if you are having panic attacks, but for general anxiety disorders I would ask to try something else before paxil."
