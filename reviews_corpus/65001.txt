"I&#039;m 58, I have GAD (General Anxiety Disorder) I&#039;ve been taking Zoloft/Sertraline 50mg, for 15 years. I &#039;ve had no problems. 3 months ago I experienced a dizzy spell with vertigo, lasted 3 hours. 2 days later my ear(s) started ringing. For 3 years now, I&#039;ve been under the stress of personally caring for my mother who is 84. I have a full time job and have had for 20 years. 2 weeks ago, I slipped into anxiety/depression. Feelings of confusion, shaking, heart racing, no appetitie, not sleeping well or sleeping to much. My in control attitude got up and went. Doc (of 34 years) says raise the dose 100mgs. It took everything I had to take 50mgs 15 years ago. I still believe in Zoloft, wondering if 75mgs will help? Thoughts on ringing, vertigo?"
