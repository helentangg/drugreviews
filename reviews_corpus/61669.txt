"I started taking this after resisting medication for acute depression. I&#039;m going through a life changing situation that won&#039;t last forever so I am hoping my time on this med will be limited to just a year. This is day 3 of 10mg. My only complaint is that I seem to have to poo constantly (not diarrhea). I&#039;m worried about the libido issue and not enough time has passed for me to know if it&#039;ll become a problem. I seem to take longer to fall asleep and feel that I&#039;m sleeping much lighter than before. Every little sound or movement from my husband wakes me. Other than that it&#039;s been positive. Yesterday I was actually a little bit giddy. I haven&#039;t been like that in over a year. It felt nice."
