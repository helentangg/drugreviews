"Absolutely changed my life. I am a 20 year old female who has struggled with depression and irritability since roughly 13. I tried meditation, I tried the &quot;power of positive thinking&quot;, I tried listening to podcasts, I tried counseling. Nothing helped me until zoloft. 

I&#039;ve been taking zoloft for 5 weeks. I had minor side affects for the first couple days (looser stool, headaches, stomach aches) but nothing I couldn&#039;t handle and they went away after 2-3 days as I got used to the medication. I&#039;m currently taking 50 mg and don&#039;t plan on increasing. 

I feel overall happier. I&#039;m not as irritable and things that I used to hate (going to work) are no longer even bad. I feel more myself, and like I&#039;m not afraid to be outgoing.

Highly recommended"
