"I had mild anxiety and was having a difficult time controlling it. I felt overwhelmed and out of control, although I looked fine on the outside. I was prescribed Xanax for panic attacks, but was having to lean on it too much to curb my anxiety so my doctor put me on Lexapro. It&#039;s fabulous--my Xanax is practically untouched since the Lexapro kicked in. It took about three months, but then I looked back and realized I hadn&#039;t been anxious in months. I feel like the &#039;old me&#039;. Side effects - had jaw clenching the first few weeks, which was really weird. But it went away. Now the only thing is if I forget to take it, I&#039;m a mess! I feel very confused and the world doesn&#039;t feel real to me. Take it at the same time each day and always have some on you."
