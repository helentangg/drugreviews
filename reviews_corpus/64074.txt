"I was prescribed 50mg for postpartum after the birth of our 2nd. I suffered from a few anxiety attacks during pregnancy but never had them prior. I was leery of medical but did not like how I was feeling. It took about 2 weeks but I really never felt better and have not had any anxiety or side effects! So happy it helped me get my life back."
