"I suffer from depression, anxiety and a bit of obsessive compulsive disorder. I just started taking this medication and in less than two weeks I feel a huge difference. Before the medication it seems I was crying about any and everything and at times for no reasons. Then the simplest things would irritate the heck out of me. Things as simple as popping gum. Now on the medication, I finally feel at ease and more calm. I even feel very upbeat and happy. Its a wonderful thing for me to even be able to say I even feel this way. I will come back after a while longer on the meds and give another update."
