"Just wanted to add more now that been taking longer. 
Positives - it&#039;s still working and at the low dose of 10mg. - Weirdly, I have lost weight although this seems like fluid and bloat loss but has amounted to half a stone. 
Issues - beginning to think I&#039;m indestructible and after having tea and wine, I had a flare. However, the flare only lasted a day and I wasn&#039;t crying in pain.
- changing brand from Actavis to Accord. Still working for IC but weirdly more unpleasant side effects, drowsiness, dry mouth and zombified feeling in morning. The difference was pretty immediate so I&#039;m sure it&#039;s that. Perhaps other users should take note of brands. I will return to Actavis as this had no side effects whatsoever."
