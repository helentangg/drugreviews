"I am a 35 year-old female. I&#039;ve always been a melancholic person (given my family history of anxiety and anger issues) but when I was younger, I have been able to experience some happiness. As I got older and had two kids, it got worse. I would get angry or sad at a drop of a hat, after which I would sink into depression. It also became more difficult to manage stress and anxiety. I began seeing a therapist who suggested that I get a physical with my primary care physician and ask if I can get a prescription for anti-depressants. I was put on 10 mg. of Lexapro. During the first few days, I was light-headed, groggy, and aware of every sensation in my body. I was also very thirsty. After a week, I felt the benefits. I feel happy again."
