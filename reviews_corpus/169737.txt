"I have been on this for 6 weeks. The first 4 weeks 25mgs at night and now the next two weeks 50 mgs at night. I have multiple herniated and torn discs from an accident and could not sleep. I have tried many other sleeping aid (Ambien ETC.) and none of them are even close. This medicine is amazing. I sleep through the night now(6 -9 hrs) amazing. Once in awhile a little groggy in the morning for about 20 minutes but that&#039;s it. Unbelievable. In a league of it own for sleep."
