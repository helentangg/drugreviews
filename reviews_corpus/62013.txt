"I&#039;ve been on and off for 9 years and I&#039;m 25. I have been on 10mg before and am currently on 5mg. I went off it for a while and I find that I am able to laugh harder but also feel deeper sadness without them. They stabilize me. I get to a very dark place without just that 5mg to keep me level. I would rather be a bit unable to express emotion than over emotional. I struggle with anxiety, paranoia and low stress tolerance. It helps me live somewhat normally. Higher doses make me feel robotic, unable to process my own emotion. I am sensitive to meds and so 5mg (half of the minimum  dose) helps me! The therapeutic dose is 20mg, and for me that would lessen the quality of my life as I would be unable to feel emotion. I love it celexa. Try it."
