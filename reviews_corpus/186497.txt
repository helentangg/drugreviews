"I&#039;m a 20 yr old female with anxiety, panic disorder, and attention deficit. This was my first day of Pristiq, but I noticed a huge change today already! I took a 50mg in the morning before work and had no problem dealing with customers or talking to strangers in general. I had a few short moments where I felt nervous, but I was surprised to find I was very relaxed all day. I really had no idea I was so anxious all the time! I would definitely recommend this!"
