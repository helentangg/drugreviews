"I was prescribed Cymbalta for anxiety, it has had a major positive impact.  I was a competitive distance runner for about 25 years and sprained both ankles and wore out my knees.  I was so achy in my joints all weekend and realized I did not take my medicine Saturday or Sunday because I put my pill case away when the cleaning lady came--HA HA.  It helps anxiety and joint pain.  I am very pleased with the results."
