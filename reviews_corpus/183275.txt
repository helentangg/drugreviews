"Cymbalta saved my life. I have tried dozens of antidepressants, mood stabilizers, you name it. At 19, to treat anxiety, depression and post traumatic stress disorder, I was finally given Cymbalta. I had very few side effects, maybe a few days being a bit dizzy. And then, after a week or so, I realized I wanted to get up in the morning. I no longer regretted having to breathe. A few months in, I no longer needed anxiety medication. I could sleep all night. I was normal and happy. I would not have lived if Cymbalta didn&#039;t exist. The only drawback is if for any reason you have to go a few days or longer without it, the withdrawal will be bad."
