"I fully understand it&#039;s hard to work through initial side effects, especially when you may be at one of your lowest points immediately prior to taking medication. It may not work for everyone, but this medication has helped me immensely. I don&#039;t feel like a permanently happy robot or anything, I still feel sad and upset when it&#039;s warranted. but I feel like I can process problems like a high functioning individual, and I don&#039;t feel like I&#039;m going to crack under every little thing. The side effects DO get better!"
