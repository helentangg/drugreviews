"I&#039;ve been on Cymbalta for almost 6 months.  I started off with the 60mg doses and I felt great (first 3 months).  The first few days I was sleeping constantly and felt completely out of it (giddy, glazed over etc).  Side effect outside of the first couple weeks was limited to orgasms taking forever.  My depression still seems to be up and down but my anxiety levels and ability to control OCD related thoughts has been wonderful.  Feels good to have less &quot;noise&quot; upstairs in the brain department. I&#039;m currently on 120mg and asking my Doctor to adjust as I&#039;m still feeling depressed.  Sleep wise I get up extremely early but fall asleep fine and seem to be much more motivated than I used to be."
