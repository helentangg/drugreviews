"I was on Zoloft for a few months. I honestly felt it takes effect within hours. Although, things would still upset me or give me anxiety, it was definitely accompanied by way more rational thinking then previously. The only side effects that I noticed, is that I find myself being tense from time to time. I would have my toes curled tightly or be making a fist... something like that, not really a big deal. I also had some sexual effects, but again, nothing I couldn&#039;t get past. I still had a sex drive and could ejaculate. It just took a little longer. I would have to say that it was the best medicine I have ever used for treatment of my anxiety and depression.  For insurance reasons, I had to change medicines. I am now working to switch back."
