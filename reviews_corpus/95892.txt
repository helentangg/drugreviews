"I was prescribed Sertraline (Zoloft) 200mg by my psychiatrist to treat Body Dysmorphic Disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder.  I&#039;ve tried in the past Fluoxetine, Citalopram and Velafaxine.

Sertraline was the very worst medication I have taken to treat Body Dysmoprhic Disorder.  It simply didn&#039;t work.  My mood was worse from day one of starting Sertraline, and remained that way right up to 200mg.  Unlike Fluoxetine, Sertraline did nothing to relieve the symptoms of Body Dysmorphic Disorder.  It did not take away the obsessional behaviour regarding my physical appearance.  The major side effect I had from Sertraline was constipation and even taking laxatives did not work."
