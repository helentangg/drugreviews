"I was on this for 5 days for anxiety, it gave me the worst panic attacks and ended up in A&amp;E because they were so bad. Everyone reacts differently to medication and this just didn&#039;t agree with me. If it was my choice I would have come off after day 1, but doctor made me stay on it until day 5 until I broke down and couldn&#039;t cope. Now trying fluoxetine and seems much better so far."
