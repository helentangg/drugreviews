"I was on Cymbalta for 9 months and from an overall mood perspective it was incredible. I did suffer 2 noticeable side effects. I had some insomnia as well as difficulty with an orgasm (I am male). I then went to Wellbutrin and that did nothing. A year later I am back on Cymbalta and the MUCH better mood is worth it. The withdrawals of stopping were absolutely horrible (nausea, dizziness), but only lasted a couple of weeks as I lowered my dosage.  I will deal with those when I stop the next time."
