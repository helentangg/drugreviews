"I was prescribed this for restless leg syndrome which was affecting my sleep. I&#039;ve now been taking it for 3 years, 10mg initially. It allows me to slip into sleep if taken about 2 hrs before I go to bed. If I do wake it allows me to get back to sleep easily. The initial dry mouth etc soon went and I am delighted with the ongoing ease with which I can sleep."
