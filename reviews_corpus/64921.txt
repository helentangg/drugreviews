"I had what was called depersonalization and derealization from my severe anxiety. I tried every natural thing i could think of. Exercise, eat right, distraction etc... but i lost hope because i couldn&#039;t push past this feeling. So i tried zoloft as my last hope and started with 25mg and i had some side effects but not bad. I will say it was worth it. My dr upped it to 50mg which gave me the most benefit. It was a lifesaver! Im so glad i tried it. I took it for 6 months and weaned from it 6 months and it was perfect. However 3 years later i have bad anxiety again due to stressors in my life so im willing to try it again but as far as dissasociating still very minimal. Hope this helps."
