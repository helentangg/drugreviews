"I was put on Elavil to treat sleep deprivation and for pain relief.  Took it for four days.  It did not help with the pain and it kept me up instead of putting me to sleep. For the first two days I slept for maybe 3 hours total (slept for one hour, woke up for about an hour, fell asleep for an hour, up again, etc.) then the last two days I went for two days straight with no sleep.   Very frustrating."
