"Wow. This medication really works with very few or no side effects for me. I finally feel normal. I am balanced, have appropriate emotions and healthy relationships. After being on Lexapro for a year and experiencing every side effect, Viibryd is a miracle to me. I used to feel numb, flat, disinterested, boring, no sex drive, etc. while on Lexapro. I talked to my doctor about Viibryd and I feel like I&#039;m back to my normal self. I&#039;m on 40 mg. Just remember to take it every day at the same time and never run out. I ran out for a few days while traveling, and the withdrawal symptoms start to kick in after the second or third missed dose, and I felt terribly hungover, cranky, tired and dizzy. Highly reccomend talking to your doctor about Viibryd"
