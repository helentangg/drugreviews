"I started taking this medication to help with my bad migraines and nausea. It helped for awhile but in the past 6 months has stopped working almost completely. The major side effects I noticed were increased emotions (I cry at everything now, and I&#039;m not a sensitive person) and I&#039;ve developed serious anxiety and stress.  I&#039;m currently weaning off this medication to try something else, but it did help for awhile."
