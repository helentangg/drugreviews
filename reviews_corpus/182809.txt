"It didn&#039;t help depression or low grade chronic pain AT ALL. I had better depression relief from Celexa and Wellbutrin.

But the biggest reason I caution against cymbalta is because of the extreme withdrawal symtoms I experienced. I followed the doctor-recommended protocol to wean off. Weaning seems to mean prolonging misery. The nausea and dizziness I have endured for the last 5+ weeks with no end in sight is debilitating.

I urge you to please research your options thoroughly before even trying cymbalta."
