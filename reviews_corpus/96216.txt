"I suffered from anxiety which turned really serious and ended in a 5-6 month depression. I never believed that depression or anxiety existed but now I really know. It is a medical tradition that needs treatment. I was on lorazepram and Abilify for awhile and it didn&#039;t do a thing for me except for make me really tired. I was hopeless and finally told my therapist how I WAS really feeling and she worked with my psychiatrist to prescribe my Zoloft. It didn&#039;t work for awhile. I started on 50mg and then was moved up to 100mg. I remember about a month later I was driving home and actually felt happy for the first time in a long long time. I felt like my old self before my anxiety and depression happened. This medicine along with counseling worked."
