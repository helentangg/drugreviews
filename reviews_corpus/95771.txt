"It saved my life.  It was the perfect medicine for me, except for chronic constipation.  Went to the hospital for the constipation (I did not know it was caused by Zoloft at the time), and they found I had appendicitis, which ruptured while I was waiting at the hospital, and also that I had kidney cancer, so got 2 surgeries, 1 for the ruptured appendicitis and 1 to take away my left kidney.  Had it not been for the Zoloft, I would be dead.  I of course had to change medicines and go the second choice prescribed by the psychiatrist.  It works, but not as well as the Zoloft, unfortunately.  Zoloft is excellent, and if it was not for chronic constipation, I&#039;d be back on it.  Good luck all."
