"I have suffered with irritable bowel syndrome for over 15 years. In the last two years it got so bad I could not continue working. Seventeen months ago my GP gave me a prescription for 100mg to take at bedtime.  The first night I slept 14 hours and woke up high as a kite.  The following two nights I took a half and the next night a quarter with the same results and decided this medicine was not for me and returned to suffering.  Three months ago in desperation I took another 100mg pill and had the same experience for three days on just the one dose. After reading reviews stating that IBS patients were taking 10 to 20 mg I started on lower doses with success. I am now trying to determine my best dosage."
