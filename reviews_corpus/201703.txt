"I have struggled with panic disorder off and on for 11 years. I was previously on Lexapro but built up a tolerance after 4 months so I switched to Zoloft. After week four I am FINALLY getting some relief from the anxiety. Started on 12.5mg due to sensitivity to SSRI&#039;S. The reason Zoloft does not get a 10 is because of terrible side effects: increase in depression and anxiety, nervousness, de-realization and insomnia. I could care less about my sex drive right now. Word to the wise: BE PATIENT, IT WILL GET BETTER."
