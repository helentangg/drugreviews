"Soooo I was prescribed this medicine back in August of 2016 after I was in a horrible car accident in may and I was afraid to take it. I lied to my doctor saying I was doing fine while I was issuing my Ativan as a daily help for anxiety... finally after my final attack 2 weeks ago I realized I needed to do something.. Living with constant anxiety is debilitating and anxious about car accidents and being around people and having an anxiety attack was not helping. I feel fine taking it!!! I started 25mg first 7 days and I&#039;m on 50mg now and the only side effect is nausea but it&#039;s very low and goes away with bread or yogurt. I seriously would recommend this to anyone. Deff happy to get my life back on track."
