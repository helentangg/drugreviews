"Have dealt with GAD anxiety most my life. Started taking Effexor for a Major Depression episode.  Doctor stared me slow.  33 mg for 4 weeks, then 75 mg for 3 weeks, then 108 mg for 2 weeks and finally 150 mg.  Been on 150 mg about 6 months, some side effects along the way.  Just basically feeling &quot;weird&quot; was the worst side effect.  Wanted to quit many times along the way, but stuck with it.  It doesn&#039;t work overnight. 
Sexual side effect is hard to have a orgasm, but I can deal that if I feel better.  Depression
is NO fun.  Good Luck All.  Tomorrow&#039;s always can be a better day.  GOD Bless."
