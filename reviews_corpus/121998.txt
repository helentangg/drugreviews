"I was only on venlafaxine for a few weeks and it didn&#039;t help much then I read all these reviews about the weight gain and blurred vision and terrible side effects. So I decided to stop taking the medicine since I had the lowest dose possible and only been taking it for a short short time. The withdrawals are almost unbearable. I cry for no reason. I can&#039;t sleep I vomit everyday and I can&#039;t judge distance with my eyes. I feel like my eyes are just floating in my head. Every time I stand up I get severely dizzy and feel like I can&#039;t move. "
