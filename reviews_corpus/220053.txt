"I have been on Ambien for many years and it stopped working for me. My dr. has tried some other meds, but so far nothing seems to work. I&#039;ve been on Elavil for about a week now and it seems as if I&#039;m taking a sugar pill. It&#039;s just not working for me I wish it did work as well for as it has for others."
