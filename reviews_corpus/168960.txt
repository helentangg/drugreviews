"Day one, nausea, stomach pain, and when I woke up, horrible body pains, muscle pains and gas and bloating in the stomach.
I am now on day 8 and the body pains are still here. My stomach looks like I&#039;m pregnant at all times. I can&#039;t sleep at night, I wake up 3-4 times a night. Nausea is gone, stomach pains are rarely there. Still have dull headaches. Don&#039;t know if I have gained weight. I seem to have slight trouble with my breathing. I do seem to be calmer and a bit less depressed but I don&#039;t think it has helped my bipolar systems as of yet."
