"I&#039;m have been taking Lamotragine and have started on escitalopram for bipolar 2. What an amazing turn around. Where I used to be extremely reactive and explode in to a rage at any little thing I now feel calm and at peace with the world. I have actually started to feel happy. I always suffered from hypo-sexuality and it was so exhausting to be fighting with sexual thoughts and tension constantly. It&#039;s such a relief that since being on escitalopram this too has stopped. I now see everything from a much more rational perspective. I&#039;ve even begun to really &quot;feel&quot; in love with my wife. Sure, it&#039;s one big drawback is that it is an orgasm killer, but I&#039;m finding this is a small price to pay compared to all the benefits. It&#039;s given me my life back"
