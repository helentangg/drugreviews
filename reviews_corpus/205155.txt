"Feel down and nervous on higher dose. Stick with 100mg or less for a while. Over 100mg might be too much, for me it is. I take klonopin, prazosin for PTSD, and latuda for mood swings. Don&#039;t give up unless it makes you horribly sick to your stomach or other side effects, but talk to your doctor first."
