"Do not give to people under 18 the black box warning is true I was put on this when  I was 16 (i&#039;m 19 now) and it made me want to kill myself to the point of hospitalization. Even though that side effect may be rare it does happen. Do not think it won&#039;t happen to you or your child because it&#039;s so rare. Im blessed to still be alive today. It makes you messed up beyond words. Should never be given to young kids. It ruined my teenage years. It ruined it!!!I am dead serious too!!!"
