"This medicine was a blessing. I was put on medicine for severe anxiety as well as helplessness/depression which was situational. Only side effect was tiredness which was fine and my sex drive is more active than before.  I am now off the medication but it definitely helped during the hard time in my life.  Because of a good doctor that listened and a combination of counseling...I am better!"
