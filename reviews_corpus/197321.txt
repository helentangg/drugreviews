"I was prescribed this medication initially for depression and then along with another medication for atypical depression and panic disorder.  I had to give it some stars because it did help with the anxiety.  Problem was I had no life.  No sex drive.  Emotionally flat.  Slept 12-16 hrs a day (I craved sleep all the time) and ate non stop eventually gaining 80 lbs.  Finally my husband encouraged me to go off it.  I tapered the dose and experienced brain zaps and generally weird feelings for several weeks.  "
