"This drug worked within a few weeks to alleviate panic attacks, stress, and anxiety.  I still get stress and anxiety but not about everything like before.  The overwelming stress and anxiety I had before taking the drug caused me to be depressed as well...crying a lot etc.  It helped with that too.  I am able to cope better and don&#039;t emotionally eat causing me to lose 25lbs pretty quickly.  I have been on 75mg for almost 2 yrs  now and don&#039;t plan on going off it anytime soon.  The only thing that is a little scary is when I miss a dose there are almost immediate side effects.  I get cranky and get weird electric like zaps in my head (hard to explain until you experience them)."
