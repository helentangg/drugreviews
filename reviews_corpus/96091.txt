"Started taking Zoloft after weaning off Tramadol for torn ACL in left knee. Zoloft saved my life! I have tried coming off Tramadol several times with no success I had to keep getting back on it because the withdrawal symptoms were so severe, that&#039;s even with my DR weaning me over 4 weeks down to 1 - 50mg tab a day! Zoloft kept me from having suicidal thoughts and anxiety along with the hot flashes and made it to where I could function and live a life again. The best advice is to start the Zoloft while you wean then it will be in your system when you completely go off the Trams, the side effects are less noticeable as your body gets adjusted. The only side effect that was annoying was yawning all the time but after a couple of days that went away."
