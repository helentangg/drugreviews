"I had terrible side effects from taking Tamoxifen.  I was diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome, acid reflux, could not sleep due to hot flashes, cried all the time, often just felt like I had the flu.  My oncologist suggested I try citalopram.  My world is wonderful!  I feel better than I ever have.  Not only did it help tremendously with the side effects of Tamoxifen, but it has also taken care of anxiety and depression that I had been living with, but never did anything about it.  I have no side effects from the citalopram, except weight gain.  I am working on that, though. All my family and friends are amazed at the difference in me.  I have been taking 20mg for over a year."
