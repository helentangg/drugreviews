"I&#039;ve been on Lexapro for 2 weeks for generalized anxiety disorder and mild depression. I do feel better and have had no side effects to speak of - the first two days felt like I drank 8 pots of coffee, but it leveled off after that and now I feel fine. My appetite is a little decreased but that is no crisis at all. Overall I am feeling better and more positive."
