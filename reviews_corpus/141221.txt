"I have suffered through depression most of my life (I am 16 now) and I have gone through many anti depressants but most left me feeling even more depressed (due to weight gain which is one of my triggers with depression). Lexapro is the only anti depressant I have been on that has not caused excessive crying, weight gain/loss, suicidial thoughts, etc. the only thing I noticed is I sleep a little more than normal but hey, sleep isn&#039;t bad for me."
