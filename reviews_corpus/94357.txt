"Day 9 of Trintallex. Have seen glimpses of normality but have still been highly unstable and dysfunctional. Side effects include: little bit itchy skin, headache, ringing in the ears, agitation/hyperactive at times. I know I&#039;m early in the process.... This is extremely difficult. I&#039;m considering getting the DNA testing to find a more suitable med if I don&#039;t see harsh improvements in the next couple of weeks."
