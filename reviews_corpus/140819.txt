"I was suffering from obsessive thoughts, anxiety, and depression.   I wasn&#039;t functioning very well in my life.   I was put on 20 mg of Lexapro.   The first 4-6 weeks were hard.  I had severe side effects and not sleeping.   I stuck it out and am so happy.   Lexapro has changed my life and the relationships I have with friends and family.   I am also taking Trazadone at night to help my insomnia and depression."
