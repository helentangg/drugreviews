"The first two months of Effexor Xr 37 mg were great, I felt good. But that apparently is just the start up. The first couple days of taking it I felt an awesome  euphoria and a high like I was on cocaine.  I was a little restless,  had a hard time getting to sleep, had  diarrhea . The doctor bumped me up to 75 mg one week ago, the first day was awesome I felt like I was on cocaine again. after that first day I felt nothing  other than an overbearing fact that I wanted to get off of the shit. I feel like complete trash.  I feel emotionless but reaally down  I don&#039;t know if I can make it another week on this medication . I&#039;ve been on 4medications and none of them have help so far. This was my last hope for medication"
