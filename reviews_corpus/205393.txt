"I have been on Pristiq for about a year now, and it is brilliant. Those who have only given it a few days need to give anti-depressants a few months for the drug to work properly, it doesn&#039;t metabolise like paracetamol or other common meds. 
The best thing about going from escitalopram to this is that I have emotions now. The worst side-effect is dizziness, which isn&#039;t the same kind of dizziness that you have after you spin around or get up really quickly. I feel like the term &quot;sparkly&quot; is more appropriate, because it is quick to go up and down in severity. I feel like I also have a  bit of photophobia with it too. Be careful with missing your medication, not taking it at the same time everyday and alcohol consumption."
