"Started Lexapro 10 mg 11 days ago. At first the side effects were very obvious. 1st day dry mouth, dizzy, tired.2nd day, fuzzy feeling, dizzy, tired.Each day got better &amp; Better. By day 5 I wasn&#039;t napping anymore. Before Lexapro, I was having serious sleep problems, probably half my depression problem. Well I am sleeping like the dead! Waking up feeling completely refreshed &amp; awake! My anxiety is gone. No more crazy thoughts and negative self talk! Feeling happy for the first time in a year. Try not to read all the negative reviews. Remember a lot of people have other things going on mentally, physically, etc. Some people also combine other medicines with Lexapro. I&#039;m only on Lexapro. So far the only thing is that I can&#039;t orgasm. Hoping that goes away."
