"I am a 23 year old male suffering from extreme MDD and GAD i have been taking 150 mg of Efexxor XL and 15 of Remeron for two months. I have tried Celexa, Lexapro, Wellbutrin XL, Zoloft, Paxil, and Prozac and this is by far the best medication! I have been lifted from the darkness and have had no side effects including sexual dysfunction. Yay!"
