"What can I say? This works. I had constant anxiety mixed with bouts of depression after a lot of trauma, constant palpitations and massive digestive problems from stress that had built up over years. The palpitations are now gone (after 15 years!) &amp; I&#039;ve reduced my stomach meds by 75% - all this in two months. I&#039;m able to rationalise my thoughts. People keep commenting on how &#039;laid back&#039; and &#039;reasonable&#039; I am. I feel like me for the first time in years. I&#039;m on a low dose (combining with therapy - the idea for me is to take the edge off of the emotional pain, not numb it completely so I can work through it).  Anyway, my point is that even on a low dose, it&#039;s effective. Side effects were annoying so that is why it gets 9/10 :)"
