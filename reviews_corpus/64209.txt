"Reading the comments on this forum I have come to a conclusion that a lot of people do not give this drug time to work! It&#039;s an older drug than many on the market and has come very much the choice of doctors in the U.K. Again as it&#039;s range of doses is long example 25mg to 200 mg so it&#039;s not a massive heavy drug, and to many people read all the negative comments on forums regarding not just sertilne but other ADs, as my doctor has said many times there is no true happy pill in the world."
