"The generic medication does not help my hot flashes. I&#039;m taking 37.5mg twice daily.  The brand worked so much better, but the price went up dramatically. I really don&#039;t want to up the dosage, but these hot flashes are happening too often now.  So, it&#039;s higher dose or live through the hot flashes. Hot flashes will not win."
