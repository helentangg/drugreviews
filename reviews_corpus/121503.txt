"I had been on cipralex (lexapro) for about a year when I noticed I was feeling too tired all the time for my liking. I asked about SNRI&#039;s because they tend to give more &quot;energy&quot;. I got switched to Effexor and didn&#039;t have a good experience at all. I couldn&#039;t stop thinking about terrible things, I had bad anxiety, excessive sweating at night and my heart would race too much too often. I had to get off after 9 weeks because it was not working for me at all. It made me really appreciate the escitalopram I was taken before. 

Clearly different antidepressants work differently for others. I&#039;m just sharing my own experience. Some may do really well on Effexor, unfortunately I didn&#039;t."
