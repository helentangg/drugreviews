"Initially, my doctor started me out on 20mg, but increased the dosage to 30mg after I complained of occassional bouts of anxiety.  I started the medication about six months ago.  I&#039;m 23 and not on any additional medication.  Now, I feel like I can balance college, family and work.  I&#039;m not experiencing anxiety and panic attacks like I was prior to the Prozac.  The first three weeks of the medication involved sick feelings, but I&#039;m glad that I stuck with it.  I also started to visit with a psychologist once a month. This has been very beneficial.  Makes me wonder why I struggled with this for years before getting help."
