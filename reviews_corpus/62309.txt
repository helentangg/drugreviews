"I suffered from depression for about 3 years after a bad breakup that caused me to have low self esteem. I lost myself and didn&#039;t know who I was anymore and became suicidal. After that I knew I needed help. I&#039;m now on Celexa, I don&#039;t stress like I used to. I&#039;m just a happier person I never have suicidal thoughts anymore. I&#039;m not 100% yet but I way better than before. I&#039;m about to graduate college in 2 weeks and I feel like I have a purpose now. Celexa saved life."
