"I&#039;ve been taking Zoloft for over a year (100mg tablets) for my SAD and depression. before Zoloft I was engaged in self harm, overly complicated fear, panic attacks, depersonalization, no motivation, and missing school at least once a week from lack of motivation. Now that I&#039;ve been on it, I&#039;ve been less involved in those problems, though I wouldn&#039;t say it&#039;s 100% from the Zoloft, but rather just some life choices, though the Zoloft did still cater into those choices. I&#039;m still depressed and have anxiety, but I have improved since I started taking it, and I thank it for helping me. I would say that my panic attacks and motivation have improved and I&#039;m having less problems, I can finally say I&#039;m even just a little happy with life again."
