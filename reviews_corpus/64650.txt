"I am 20, almost 21, and I have been on this drug for a month. I started taking half a pill for 2 weeks then took a whole one. While on half, I noticed that I was SO tired. I had very little emotion and didn&#039;t want to do anything. I even noticed that I had issues in the morning(when I took the pill) that it made it harder to hold my urge to go to the bathroom.Then on a whole pill I had the same symptoms but doubled. I even noticed that my current metal state is worse. I am definitely feeling emotions, negative ones. I feel like everything I do is wrong and would rather run away from my problems instead of face them. Even my twin sister is experiencing the same thing, could be since we share the same DNA.So this is not the drug for me or her."
