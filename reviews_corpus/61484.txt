"I take this for depression and generalised anxiety; I do suffer from social anxiety as well, have done for 12 years. Had pretty much no side effects, started on 10mg, up to 20mg, then up to 40mg for 10 days before my period due to suspected PMDD. Then 40mg daily. 
Have recently dropped back to 20mg, without discussing with doctor, as my depression is still going strong, anxiety is better but still visits and socially? The last few weeks have noticed a big change in my head, for the worse; everyone is &#039;out to get me / hates me&#039; type thinking, plus I&#039;m starting to depress-eat after finally losing 10kg (yes it was anxiety related stress, but silver lining, I lost 10kg!)."
