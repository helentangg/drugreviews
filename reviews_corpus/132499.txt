"I had hives for over a year since moving to a new environment.  After trying almost every antihistamine and taking 7 cycles of prednisone, I went to see a new allergist.  She started me on xolair injections and doxepin to help with the any breakthrough itching.  I started at 25mg at night and ended up at 75mg.  I haven&#039;t had a hive since starting on the xolair and 75mg of doxepin.  I am hesitant to decrease the doxepin because I have had the best solid sleep since I started taking it.  Seriously if you have hives I would definitely recommend trying the doxepin - it is amazing."
