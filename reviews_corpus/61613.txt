"I have struggled with bouts of depression my whole adult life. Now that I have 3 children, I realized how my depression spats could and was affecting them. Short fuse, drinking too much in the evenings, inconsistent parenting responses. I am also high strung and type-A, and have a dormant eating disorder. Gave citalopram 20 a try and for 2 weeks, I felt like everything was worse...I was nauseous, extra tired all day (even though I took it at night), crying jags and lack of stamina or enthusiasm. Then, everything changed! Life is good, chaotic and full. I am my best me. And I love sex! There is peace now in my head, which makes me more productive, less self-deprecating, and much more patient."
