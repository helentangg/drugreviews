"I am an addict and have had chronic insomnia for 20 years, so as you would imagine I&#039;ve tried everything and abused everything. Doxepin is a miracle med for me. I take 10 to 30mg depending on how sleepy I am. I have no side effects, no weight gain, no sleepiness the next day. Want extra help? Read up on Magnesium. Just added that with amazing results. Depression and anxiety...well haven&#039;t found the miracle for those yet."
