"I&#039;ve had generalised anxiety for years as well as fairly mild depression. This as the 3rd SSRI medication I&#039;ve been on and most definitely the WORST. I would give this a minus score if I could! I&#039;m putting this review on here as a warning to others.

Within a week of being on this med my depression went from mild to severe. I was not in a good place. I came off this med as fast as I could and even that was very unpleasant. 

I mentioned this to my GP and pharmacist and both seemed to not believe me..please be wary of this devil&#039;s concoction."
