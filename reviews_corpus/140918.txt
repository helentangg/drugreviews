"Was on fluoxetine for 20 years. Initially I thought they wouldn&#039;t help me. At first I felt worse, but then one day, three months later I realised I felt like my old self again. It was wonderful. The only time I had anxiety was whenever I tried to stop taking my tablets, otherwise I was completely &#039;normal&#039;. Then the most awful  thing happened. I had surgery this year ( not the first time I&#039;ve had surgery) and when I woke up from the anaesthetic I was suffering from severe anxiety. I was terrified. I increased my dose of fluoxetine but after 4 months of severe anxiety, I reluctantly asked to try another SSRI. I noticed a difference almost straight away. Now after taking them for 5 weeks I&#039;m almost back to my old self."
