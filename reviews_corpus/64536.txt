"Been taking 50mg of Sertraline a day for about 2 months now and can honestly say I feel like a new person. I feel more able to be myself and problems don&#039;t get to me as much as they did before. I&#039;ve experienced ongoing dreams at night (each dream picks up from where the last left off) but that&#039;s probably the only odd thing I&#039;ve experienced and it&#039;s nice to have dreams again anyway, gives you a chance to think about what your subconscious mind is telling you."
