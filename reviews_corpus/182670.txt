"I was put on this for a while.  It made me very depressed, anxious and withdrawn.  It was only when my friends told me how bad I was that I realised I was having a real &quot;breakdown&quot; on it.  I went to see my doctor who changed me to Sertraline which suits me a lot better.  I was depressed before I took Duloxetine but I went in to a very dark place that I had trouble getting out off.  We are all different and different medication suit different people."
