"Been on this stuff for like almost two months and I haven&#039;t felt better. In fact I&#039;ve been feeling more aggressive and sadder. I have crazy mood swings (didn&#039;t have them before this med) and I feel extremely angry and sad all the time. This didn&#039;t work on me. Worst antidepressant I&#039;ve tried"
