"I have IBS and am trying to following the FODMAP diet which is very difficult and limiting.  I began to take just 5 mg. of Desipramine a week ago, and haven&#039;t had any IBS symptoms.  
Are other people using the FODMAP diet????  If Desipramine quiets the symptoms of IBS, I would love to get off the FODMAP diet because of the strict limitations.
Thanks for any feedback."
