"I have been taking amitriptyline for 2 weeks for irritable bowel syndrome. Until now I was taking Buscopan 3-4 x a day. They were really good and helped my problem with diarrhea but on the odd occasion I&#039;d still get a flare up and had to watch what I eat. I now take 10 mg of amitriptyline each night and am pleased to say, I&#039;m now able to eat whatever I fancy without getting the gurgling tummy, bloatedness and urgency to use the loo. "
