"I had been depressed for many years and tried just about everything out there, nothing worked. Then my doctor put me on Pristiq. I am now feeling like a new person. I have been on it for 2 years now and never want to go off it. I have however forgotten to take a dose and the next day was awful. Mood swings in the snap of a finger, tears over minor things etc. Great medicine."
