"I had IBS so bad I was living on 8 Imodium a day, just to be able to function. Any less than 8 tablets, and I would be on the toilet all day. I even switched from working days to working a low stress night job as a caregiver because my stomach was calmer at night. I also had really bad migraines. I was averaging 12-15 migraine days a month. Finally, I went to the doctor and told him about both of my problems. He suggested amitriptyline to control both issues. Within a month I could tell a major difference. I&#039;ve been taking 50 mg every night for about 2 years now. My stomach still gets mildly sensitive occasionally. But I rarely get diarrhea and never have to take Imodium anymore. My migraines are down to about 4 or 5 a month."
