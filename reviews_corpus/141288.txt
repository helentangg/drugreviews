"It really has changed my life for the better. Before lexapro i&#039;d taken wellbutrin, paxil, cymbalta, and zoloft. None of those worked. Paxil completely took away my sex drive. Cymbalta gave me horrible night tremors. Wellbutrin I just felt like a zombie and it didn&#039;t take away any anxiety, and the same with zoloft. Just felt like a zombie. Lexapro just gives me a feeling of being confident around larger crowds of people. Anxiety is little to none most days. I feel better. The only reason I didn&#039;t give it a 10 is because i&#039;ve been taking it for 3 months, and I still have the &quot;tired&quot; feeling. No matter what time of the day or night I take it, I still feel tired. But it&#039;s worth it to feel normal."
