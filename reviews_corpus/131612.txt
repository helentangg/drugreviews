"Hi, I&#039;ve been on Effexor for 2 weeks now.
I feel a lot less anxious and generally happier.
I&#039;ve noticed some side effects, which I was expecting. So I thought I&#039;d share my experience.
Sweaty hands, blurred vision, nightmares, stomach ache / head ache, loss of appetite, weight loss, trouble sleeping, major increase of the the effects of alcohol. Those are just some of them."
