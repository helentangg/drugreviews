"I have been on Viibryd for about 3 months with mixed results.  I started on 10 mg, I saw little improvement and increased my dosage to 20 mg.  The pros:  it took me out of a suicidal depression; my anxiety is lower, the physical symptoms of anxiety have decreased too; I have more energy, no more afternoon naps.  The cons: sexual side effects are present, not as bad as other SSRIs but still bothersome enough to keep me from increasing my dosage; diarrhea in the beginning but it does go away, be sure to take it with food; same with insomnia; vivid dreams; has done nothing for OCD and besides alleviating my suicidal idealization it&#039;s done little for my depression, I feel flat and unmotivated.  Going up to 40 mg may help but I&#039;m ambivalent."
