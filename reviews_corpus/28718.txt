"Was given Lexapro for mild depression, during the 18months I was on it I suffered hot flushes, constant tiredness, severe carbohydrate craving with a weight gain of approximately 2kg per month, all in the upper body, especially the abdominal region. No sexual desire and complete apathy. My GP put this down to depression and kept increasing the dosage. My family intervened when my liver bloods started to be abnormal. I came off Lexapro from 20mg per day over a 2 month period. Since being off it, I feel amazing, 8 hours sleep is sufficient, whereas on Lexapro I was sleeping up to 14 hrs daily and still constantly tired. The abdominal weight gain has vanished without any change in my routine and most importantly the hot flushes are gone. 32yr female."
