"I&#039;ve suffered from anxiety my whole life. It was exacerbated 11years ago when I gave birth to my daughter at 17. I&#039;ve tried so many different medications with horrible side effects. I&#039;m diagnosed with PTSD and hypervigilance so no side effect, no matter how minuscule, slipped by me. During my last bad episode of depression/anxiety, I reluctantly agreed to try sertraline. My dr started the lowest dose possible, 25mg (lower than she had ever prescribed) in the hopes it would ease my anxiety about side effects. I&#039;m now on 75mg a day and so happy I finally found the medication that works for me! My only side effect is night sweats and vivid dreams. Don&#039;t give up! Sertraline is med #4 I&#039;ve tried and the first one that really worked for me."
