"My son was prescribed 75 mg venlafaxine by his physician for anxiety and depression. He had many of the side effects for 18 months without realizing it was from the drug. Excessive burping, yawning, insomnia, mood swings, and tremors. He stopped taking them and after 8 days had a manic episode from the withdrawals. He was hospitalized in ICU for 4 days. It almost killed him. Do not take an anti-psychotic or anti-depressant drug without a diagnosis from a psychiatrist. This type of drug must be monitored weekly by a professional. After follow up care with a psychiatrist said he has probably never been depressed but had situational anxiety disorder from the pressure of college. He now has PTSS from the experience getting off the drug."
