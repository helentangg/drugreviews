"Suffer from depression, anxiety and panic attacks, first I was given sertraline, 3 days I felt sick and just rubbish after 1-2weeks I felt like I could move around,  do what needed to be done, there were side affects, felt a bit like a zombie, but I was managing and coping and living my life and did stop after 6months wanting to tackle it on my own and try and manage, after 7months off them I found symptoms slowly getting worse and felt I should go back on 25mg - Like others have said stick with it, its better to manage and live then feel trapped in your own body."
