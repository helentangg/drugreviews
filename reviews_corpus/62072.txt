"I am now 31, degree graduate, with an addictive personality (GP diagnosed). This lead to a period of depression in my early 20&#039;s, including the use of LSD, that made me very withdrawn. It was around this time, I was first introduced to Citalopram by my GP. Finding I also had a hereditary depression, I was prescribed 20mg of Citalopram. This worked over a 1 month period, beginning with an initial 2 days of increase anxiety, dry mouth, feelings of dizziness, this was followed by a &#039;plateau&#039; effect after 2 weeks, full recovery 1 month. I have since been on and off for 10 years now, with excess use of alcohol. I am calm but want to remove alcohol from my life. I intend to use Citalopram for this as advised, to help me adapt to an alcohol free life."
