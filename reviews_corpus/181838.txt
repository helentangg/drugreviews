"I have been on 20mg of Prozac daily for a month now. I also take 0.5mg of Xanax for break through panic/anxiety attacks. I have never felt better. After 20 plus years of struggling with depression I have finally found something that helps without all of the yucky side effects. I&#039;m 34 years old and am finally enjoying my life. My family and friends have also noticed the difference this has made. I love it."
