"I&#039;ve been taking Pristiq for 2 full months now.  It helps me get up and out of the house and I don&#039;t feel as hopeless.  People aren&#039;t getting on my nerves as much either. Continuing side effects for me are sleepiness, headaches and a rise in blood pressure.  I&#039;m seeing my doctor to taper off as the side effects are too much.

In the first few weeks I noticed a dramatic loss of appetite which has unfortunately gone away.  I have some weight to lose.  For a while there I was eating like a &quot;normal&quot; person, which was really nice.

I&#039;ve been on everything, most recently Prozac and Cymbalta.  Just don&#039;t know if there&#039;s anything left to try."
