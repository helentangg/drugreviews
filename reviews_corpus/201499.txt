"Zoloft. You made me REALIZE, I&#039;ve been locked out of HEAVEN for too long (I&#039;ve been dancing and cleaning on this Bruno Mars song all morning). That&#039;s how I feel on my medication!
I&#039;m on day 4 of 50 mg and I&#039;m supposed to increase it to 100mg after 10 days.
I have been having side effects since the first day such as shaking, abdominal pain, insomnia but nothing too major compared too what the &quot;Beast&quot; (yes! I call my anxiety the beast hehe) had me endure before. So I really don&#039;t mind those side effects because I know what&#039;s ahead of me is going to be spectacular. I&#039;ve never had so much faith in my life before, at least not that I remember."
