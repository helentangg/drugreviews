"I am currently in rehab I was addicted to benzos and prescribed methadone . And coming off these two h ve uncovered anxiety and depression.  I have suffered from anxiety many times before but I hadn&#039;t really had depression in years I really  think it was  drug induced . I started citalopram 10mg 3-4 weeks ago and it wasn&#039;t cutting it,  so started 5mg trintelix two days ago, so far so good,  I feel more alert, the only side affect is slight ringing in my head,vit&#039;s not really bothering me hoping it passes .   Take care.:)"
