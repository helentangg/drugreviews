"While this med is fairly effective in the treatment of chronic pain, unless you plan to stay on it for the rest of your life you should not even consider taking it. Discontinuation of this medication has to be done under the supervision of a physician and the withdrawal is horrific, leaving one unable to function in a normal capacity for weeks, or even months. Most doctors don&#039;t mention this. Some aren&#039;t even aware of it. I urge you to be cautious in your decision to take Cymbalta. Google &quot;Cymbalta withdrawal&quot; first!"
