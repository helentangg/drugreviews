"I&#039;ve been suffering for 15+ years with migraines. I prefer not to take prescription medication but had tried homeopathic remedies, adjusted my diet and lived a very regimented lifestyle but would still have 8+ migraines a month. Was prescribed 10 mg in the evening. I started taking 5 mg to slowly start my body on it and minimize side effects---been on 5 mg for the last 6 weeks and have had tremendous success. Side effects: sleepiness in the am--so I take the pill about 6:30 in the evening and have minimal sleepiness in the morning. I was worried about weight gain but haven&#039;t seen it (I&#039;m 110 so it would be noticeable). Dry mouth--I just drink more water. Other than that, minimal side effects."
