"Had a major depressive episode out of nowhere (no stressful life circumstances). When I started on 10 mg I stayed awake 40 hours straight and had panic attacks. Went off it. After horrible Effexor side effects I started on 5 mg of Lexapro again (I was absolutely desperate) and gradually increased. For the first two weeks this drug made my anxiety/depression way worse and I became delusional, but once I took a very small dose of seroquel I became progressively better each day and I have no symptoms of mental illness whatsoever anymore. Completely healed me of depression."
