"I honestly can&#039;t praise this medication enough. I had previously been on fluxeotine which sent me into overdrive and in turn I had what I would class as a breakdown. I needed to come off them and I didn&#039;t have high hopes for much else. Citalopram did everything I wanted it to. Stopped the tears and allowed me to get back into a sleep pattern. Yes after a year or so I think I may have became somewhat numb to some things but this was far better than what was happening previously. I stayed on the medication 8 months after the symptoms disappeared as advised and have now been off meds for a year and still feel very positive. I have my down days and tears but handle situations far better. I must state that medication alone will not work."
