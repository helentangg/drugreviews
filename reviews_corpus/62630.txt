"I&#039;m a 27 year old female. Took Celexa for anxiety that wouldn&#039;t let me leave the house and caused my face to flush with any social interaction, also for depression that debilitated me to the point of almost losing everything.  Celexa was a miracle drug for me.  I used it for approximately 2 years. I loved it until the night sweats (Drenches) started. I woke up 3-4 times a night completely drenched with sweat.  My knee&#039;s would even sweat.  Switched to Zoloft, am now depressed and anxious again, and plan to go back to Celexa and be dehydrated. It&#039;s worth it."
