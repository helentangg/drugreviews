"I have experienced moderately severe depression for my entire adult life, and have taken a variety of SSRIs and SNRIs on and off for 20 years, as well as a few drugs in trial stages and not yet on the market. None of them did a whole lot for me, though Brintellix actually did improve my mood, sleep patterns, appetite and social functioning. I hesitate to call anything a wonder drug, and I fully acknowledge that there are a ton of factors in play and everyone responds differently, but Brintellix is far and away the best antidepressant for me, and the only one that works as desired. To top it off, it does not produce any noticeable side effects, for me. Now if it were only off patent or better covered by my insurance, I&#039;d be happy!"
