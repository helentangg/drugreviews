"I have been unemployed for going on 3 years and at age 58 after lay off I see no end in sight. Its been constant rejection or no reply to my hundreds of resumes sent.
Not 1 interview-not 1 call of inquiry-dead silence.
My severance and $401K long drained and no health care for 2 1/2 years with wife and 4 kids so you get the picture of high stress and depression.
My Dr prescribed Citalopram. I noticed pretty immediate results in calming me down and have to say about 2 months later it has worked.
But at times I still feel a bit jumpy and take things personally so it could be that I just need to up dosage from current 20MG. It works- that&#039;s all that matters."
