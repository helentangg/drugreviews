"Cymbalta saved my life 2 times.
I&#039;ve been taking those pills (60 mg) for both cases of depression. Everytime this drug worked like a miracle on me. It made me come back to normal. I have felt almost none side effects. First week, just diahrrea, some ticklings and a bit of tinitus. Nothing annoying at all. Then, everything went to normal again. I&#039;m here in part thanks to Cymbalta."
