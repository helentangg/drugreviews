"I had suffered with panic attacks since I was around 14 years old. There came a time when I had shock treatments because back in the 60&#039;s not much was known about these kinds of illnesses.  Later on, I became completely housebound for 8 years.  I heard about Tofranil and decided to try it.  Within 3 weeks I was able to not only get out of my house but go about 3 blocks away.  It takes time, but if it had not been for Tofranil combined with Xanax I would still be home bound.  It works, no two ways about it. When nothing else did.  The only side effects were sleepiness until it gets into your system (2 weeks for me) and dry mouth. But for me that was nothing to getting my life back."
