"I was on both cymbalta dueloxetine and I would swing in and out of black moods and get very angry and uncontrollable. I&#039;m a small girl 5&quot;3 114lbs at the time and it took 3 full grown men to get me held down several times. We&#039;re now trying new medications after we discovered I was having seizures for months before starting the meds, It is a great medication to be on if it fits with you and your current medications. Do your research thoroughly"
