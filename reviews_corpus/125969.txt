"Viibryd has worked extremely well for me. I haven&#039;t taken any other antidepressants in the past. 

One of my main concerns was the loss of sexual arousal. I&#039;m in my early 20s and that scared me a little. I was informed Viibryd doesn&#039;t reduce your sexual arousal as much as others do. 

My Psychiatrist did tell me this medicine is more expensive than other anti depressants right off the bat, even with my parents insurance plan.

I&#039;d say one side effect of this medicine for me is that I need to take it every day. I notice a crash effect if I miss a day or take it later than I usually do in the morning. 

For some reason the 30MG tablets were more expensive than the 40MG tablets."
