"I&#039;ve been on Zoloft for a few months and I haven&#039;t had an anxiety attack the whole time. It&#039;s a great med, my only few issues were feeling VERY fatigued, barely have a sex drive, short term memory is horrible, and sometimes feel foggy. I have tried Paxil and Prozac and they had the same effect on me...bottom line,  Zoloft is an amazing SSRI for anxiety, with no weight gain for me. Unfortunately I&#039;ve switched to Lexapro, only because I&#039;m hoping I won&#039;t be as tired and maybe get my sex drive back a bit. If this doesn&#039;t work, I&#039;ll definitely go back to Zoloft and probably add a small dose of Wellbutrin. That combination made me feel the most normal but my doc wanted me to try Lexapro 1st."
