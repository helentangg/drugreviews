"I started at 5 mg and after the first week it worked. I then upped it to 10 mg per the doctors orders but am gonna ask if its okay to go back down to 5mg since it was working. I went from not eating, can&#039;t get out of bed, can&#039;t take care of my kids, depressed, horrible thoughts, can&#039;t make dinner, bad with money, just all around sloppy to my normal self. I&#039;m able to think clearly, clean my house, make dinner, enjoy my family. I was afraid to take it but am now thankful . The only side effect for me is sleepiness at night, which is good, and urinary tract infection. Hopefully it was clear up with keflex and a lower dose. I&#039;m okay with it because my life is back."
