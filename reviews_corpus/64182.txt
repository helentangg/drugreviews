"Side effects 1st couple of weeks, tingling fingers, shaking hands, insomnia &amp; nausea...All of which ceased thereafter.  Felt a lifting of mood day two &amp; incredibly better from weeks 3 to 4.  Suffered from depression &amp; anxiety, both of which are much better.  Easier to cope with everything, keep things in perspective &amp; enjoy life.  Noticed lately issue with short-term memory, to the point where I forget the end of my sentences which is tricky...Believe is a likely side effect so will discuss with my GP.  Overall am very glad I started with this as the improvement is fab."
