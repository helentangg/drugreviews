"I started Amitriptyline for Fibromyalgia, with hopes that it would also help with depression &amp; anxiety. My max dose so far is 40mgs @ bedtime. Initially, it was extremely sedating, but less so as time went on, &amp; when I started taking Wellbutrin for fatigue, I had no residual sedation or daytime sleepiness at all. Ami was a life saver to me in regards to pain relief. As for depression &amp; anxiety, it wasn&#039;t helpful until I combined it with Wellbutrin. I would highly recommend the combo for Fibro fog/fatigue/pain/anxiety/depression. It&#039;s like taking an SNRI without the side effects! I increase by 10mgs as needed when my pain begins breaking through. I also found if I&#039;m really stressed or anxious during the day &amp; take 10mgs, it is very calming."
