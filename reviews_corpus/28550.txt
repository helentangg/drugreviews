"Lexapro is awesome.  Before lexapro I would overthink about everything.  When I was in a relationship I would just think and think and think about if they were cheating, if I was too ugly, if they were thinking about leaving me blah blah blah.  I would just feel really stressed out and would cry a lot.  Now I feel fabulous.  The only negative is it makes me pee in the middle of the night- so annoying and I want to make out with strangers less often.  I haven&#039;t gained weight but haven&#039;t lost any either.   At first this medicine gave me wicked insomnia but now I take it first thing in the morning.  Good luck!  Remember being sad isn&#039;t necessary and most people who talk bad about being on antidepressants spend hours at the bar."
