"I have been on Cymbalta for about 4 months now, and finally can say that it is worth going through some of the beginning side effects.  We must be careful though, to listen to our bodies first.  Side effects can be bothersome but should not be unbearable, so if this is your case with Cymbalta or any other medication, you must consult your physician.  When I first started Cymbalta, (which I did twice before finally staying on it) I could not sleep, had headaches, and could not even drink a cup of coffee without feeling as if I was hyper.  Eventually, things got better and I was able to stop the additional medication that was prescribed to help me sleep.  Switching Cymbalta to bedtime helped tremendously!  No pain and/or anxiety."
