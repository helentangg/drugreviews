"Took it for about five days and haven&#039;t been able to eat or sleep. Had pain in my chest so I stopped taking it this morning and I&#039;ve had an extremely high heart rate all day. Doctors were worried but the ECG looked ok they said. I still had racing thoughts and anxiety, Just didn&#039;t work for me."
