"I have bipolar. This was brought in to control the depression. It did that too well and sent me into mania. Very irritable an constant feelling of anger. I was very scary to be around.
As for the nausea, that lasted about 2 weeks and i could live with that. From that point I started to have severe gastrointestinal issues. I have been off it for 9 months. I am still seeing GI specialists, as anything even slightly acidic causes immense pain.
If brintellix works for you, that&#039;s great.  But if you start getting stomach cramps you should run and get off the damn thing.
It has literally ruined my life."
