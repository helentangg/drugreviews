"I began taking Sertraline in November 2015. I struggled with major depression for years (age 15) I am now 23. I never accepted the fact I had depression and didn&#039;t want to &#039;depend&#039; on a tablet to make me happy then I reached a horrible point in my life, in a dark cave for no reason at all, all I was doing was crying and I couldn&#039;t understand why and I was scared of myself so I had to do something before I done something stupid so I went to the docs and she put me on these (other tablets I&#039;ve been on in the past were useless in my opinion) and I&#039;ve been on sertraline for a total of 10 months now and I&#039;ve only had a bad episode of &#039;being in a dark hole again but only for 2 days thankfully&#039; but none since (that was in February)"
