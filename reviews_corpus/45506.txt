"Started taking Prozac for bulimia/depression about three weeks ago. The first week I was on a low dose (10mg) with no positive or negative side effects. The second week I was on 20mg and was less depressed but still not a positive effect for my problem. I&#039;m at the end of week 3 and on 40mg and I can really see a difference now. Haven&#039;t had the need to binge/purge in 5 days and my appetite has decreased to where I only eat the regular 3 meals/day. Because of this I&#039;ve actually LOST 3lbs. Also I&#039;m more motivated to do things now with this medicine. I&#039;m very happy with this medication so far. Only negative is I&#039;ve noticed it&#039;s been harder to go to the bathroom. Not sure if it&#039;s the medicine, but it&#039;s the only thing I can think of."
