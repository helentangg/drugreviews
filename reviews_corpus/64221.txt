"Hi all, after reading mixed reviews online on antidepressants I was apprehensive the drug could actually work. I was experiencing panic attacks that lasted all day, I was started on 50mg straight away and experience increased panic for the first 4 days but no other side effects. From day 5 panic attacks are almost non existent, it really is a wonderful  drug, just stick to it and remember it will get better with time."
