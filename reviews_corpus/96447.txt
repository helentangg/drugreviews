"I&#039;ve been on 75mg for 5 months. I slowly started to feel normal and before I knew it, within 2 months. Had a huge breakthrough. I was no longer having panic attacks. What I like about Zoloft is that it makes me feel like me. Not a drugged up version of me. I had a few side effects like loss of appetite, insomnia but all in all, I feel a lot better."
