"I am currently 16 y/o &amp; have been taking nortriptyline for about 6 years to treat migraines. I have been getting migraines since I was 8 or 9 and it eventually got to the point where migraines were a daily thing for me. After seeing a neurologist &amp; trying out 2 or 3 other perscriptions, my neurologist prescribed nortriptyline. It worked for a while then my dosage needed to be increased, however I still take it to this day, once before bed every single night. The only time I get a migraine now is if I&#039;m sick, skip two or more doses, or encounter a trigger, such as prolonged sun exposure, dehydration, large caffeine amounts, etc."
