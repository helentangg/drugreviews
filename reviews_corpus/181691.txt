"I didn&#039;t realize how stressed I was until I&#039;d been taking Prozac for 6 weeks and compared myself to what I was like the previous month. I&#039;d been stressed for a really long time. Now, less stressed, I&#039;m more focused and productive in work! I didn&#039;t think that was possible. I&#039;m also creative again. I feel I have a chemical imbalance that needed redressed. I always thought having to take anti depressants was a sign of failure but now I realize it&#039;s just a chemical imbalance. Good luck!"
