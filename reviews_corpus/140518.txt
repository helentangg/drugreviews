"I have always had slight anxiety my whole life, then in my early 20&#039;s it got very, very bad. Off and on. Last winter was the final straw for me, after many stressful situations, I broke down badly. It was constant. Though by the spring it eased up, during the summer I finally sucked it up and started Apo-Escitalopram. I was prescribed 10 mg but refused to take the whole pill. I only take about 2 mg a day, and have for 6 months. However, that small amount worked well, surprisingly. I noticed after 2 months, situations that would bother me previously only mildly bugged me, if at all. It felt great not to care. Only the past few weeks I have felt it may not be enough, now that it&#039;s winter. Considering a small increase."
