"I am so happy I tried this miracle medicine.  I am 32 and was diagnosed with OCD, anxiety, and depression when I was 18.  I have been on and off Zoloft since I was diagnosed. At first Zoloft helped with my diagnosis but I had a lot of side effects including; NO sex drive, being tired all the time, and feeling flat(not happy or sad).  I also tried Paxil, Wellbutrin, and Buspar.  This is the only medicine for me.  I have only been on Pristiq for 5 days but I already feel happier and best of all hello libido!  I thought I was going to live out the rest of my life on a roller coaster of being on and then taking myself off of the Zoloft and on no medicines, just so that I could feel closer to my boyfriend.  You do not have to choose between happiness and a libido!  Thank you Pristiq!"
