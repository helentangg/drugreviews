"I started Prozac after a bout with anxiety and depression with insomnia.  I had probably depleted myself nutritionally and emotionally after a really rough year.  Lost my Dad, on-going struggles with eating disorders, chronically ill husband, etc ... what a difference.  I have been on it for almost a year and I am fine.  I feel  great - like myself.  Just need to give it time in the beginning.  I think the medication and eating healthy and exercising has helped greatly.  My stress level is just as high -- just able to take the problems now with normal reactions."
