"My first psychiatrist misdiagnosed me with depression, panic disorder, and anxiety disorder and put me on Lexapro.  He continued to increase the Lexapro amount from 20 mg/day up to 60 mg/day.  Great for depression; however, as I said, I was misdiagnosed and I&#039;m bi-polar.  The Lexapro triggered a manic episode.  The episode also was extremely severe, and my new psychiatrist diagnosed me correctly, took me off the Lexapro, indicated that this class of drugs can amplify bi-polar issues, particularly at the high level I was on.  It nearly cost me everything because of the severe manic episode."
