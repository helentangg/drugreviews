"I am 74 years old and have been suffering from spinal stenosis and osteoarthritis for over 12 years. I had 2 lumbar and 2 cervical surgeries with a total of 8 laminectomies and 8 fused joints. The pain clinic had prescribed a regimen of morphine for a couple years which helped a little. After my 4th lumbar surgery I suffered lower back pain for over 2 years. I stopped morphine treatment last year and have started 30 mg duloxetine, twice daily now for less than a week and  can&#039;t believe the results. Almost immediate relief of most lumbar pain, and I am walking without a cane. The side effects are minimal, and I will gratefully cope with them if this relief continues."
