"I was on cymbalta 60mg for 18 months. I&#039;ve been on many different antidepressants throughout the years. My issue is not when you take it but when you go off. Please do not take this medicine. I&#039;ve gone through hell the last 12 days getting this drug out of my system. Google cymbalta withdrawal or cymbalta discontinuation syndrome to learn more."
