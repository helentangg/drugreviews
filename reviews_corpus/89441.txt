"Celexa has been a life-saver for me.  Ever since I was a child, I&#039;ve had bad anxiety and depression, and I would have attacks where I would completely break down emotionally over something so silly, like a lost T.V remote.  I would talk to my mother about my anxiety, and she said it was something I just needed to get over.  Finally at age 23, I&#039;ve confronted this problem medically, and Celexa has changed my life entirely.  I don&#039;t experience the depression I used to, my anxiety has decreased incredibly, and my attacks have almost disappeared. I don&#039;t feel a hovering weight on my shoulders anymore like I&#039;m constantly letting people down, I&#039;m just living my life like I&#039;m supposed to."
