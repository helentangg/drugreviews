"I had a car accident two and a half years ago.  It damaged my shoulder and gave me severe back pain.  Last year I eventually had an operation to resolve the problem of a chipped bone and a release but it did not help me with the constant stabbing pain which I was told was my nerve and tendons being in a knot.  After numerous attempts through physiotherapy, massages, pain killers and injections, none of them worked until I was prescribed nortriptyline.  What a difference, I am hardly in any pain now and feel much better."
