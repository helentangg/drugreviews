"Generally speaking, I don&#039;t like anti-depressants.  I&#039;ve taken Zoloft, Paxil, Effexor (which was the horrible one for *me*), Lexapro, Prozac...seems like I&#039;m forgetting one.  They&#039;ve never made me feel &quot;better&quot; or &quot;happy,&quot; just &quot;numb&quot; and &quot;flat.&quot;  
With Brintellix, I started off at 10mg for 6 weeks.  I go for my checkup tomorrow and will be increasing to 20mgs.  YES, I DID get nausea in the mornings for a couple of hours after I&#039;d taken it.  Taking it with food helped.  That is a side effect that, for me anyway, went away within a couple of weeks.  I expect the same with increasing to 20mgs, but I think it&#039;s worth it in the long run.  I actually feel HAPPIER! More energetic, want to do things, etc.  Has been miracle so far for me."
