"I am a 43 year old mom who&#039;s struggled with bouts of anger and anxiety. I felt so agitated by everything, I didn&#039;t want my boyfriend to even look at me and it took a toll on our relationship. I&#039;m a grad student and an HR manager with a high stress work environment. I have ADD as well so I began taking a small amt of aderall with the zoloft and I am a &#039;sweetheart&#039; now as my boyfriend says. In fact, we are ring shopping now. The zoloft does have the 1 sexual side effect for me which makes it difficult for me to &#039;finish&#039;...but overall I really like this medication."
