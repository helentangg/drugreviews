"I&#039;ve only been on 50mg Zoloft for about a week and I feel like I&#039;m in a way better mood at times and haven&#039;t felt as depressed as I was before taking it. However I&#039;ve lost a lot of sleep because of it, lost my appetite, getting confused at times, and absolutely no libido even if I tried. At times I feel like a complete zombie and it gets difficult trying to work because I feel so numb. I also feel a lot slower mentally but that may be because of lack of sleep.Before zoloft  I was having a suicidal thought every other day and cutting myself almost everyday and now of zoloft I am NOT thinking of hurting myself and 1 suicidal thought in a week. I&#039;ve been a lot happier on this medication."
