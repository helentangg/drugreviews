"I developed fibromyalgia recently. I had been on low dose of a similar medication (Doxepin) for long time, mainly for a sleep disorder. The neurologist I saw for my fibromyalgia suggested switching from Doxepin to Amitriptyline. Overall, I am glad I made the switch, as my fibromyalgia is now much more manageable. I take 35 mg of amitriptyline nightly. Initially very sedating, but now less so. It has also helped my irritable bowel syndrome. On the negative side, it has led to constipation problems, and my irritable bladder (bladder urgency) is now much more chronic, which is surprising because amitriptyline has higher anticholinergic properties. But my pharmacist feels that Doxepin must have helped me more with that. NOTE: Beware of combining amitriptyline with Detrol LA (for bladder urgency)."
