"I tried taking Celexa for 1 month. The main reason for choosing this medicine over others was the cost - very affordable.  However, I was taking it for sadness, fatigue, irritability and anxiety and Celexa only made me more tired.  It did work well for the stress and anxiety, but I slept a lot.  I often fell asleep when I didn&#039;t want to.  I am now trying another medicine that does not make me sleep, but it is very expensive and does not knock out the nerves and stress like Celexa does."
