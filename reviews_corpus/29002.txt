"I&#039;ve been on Lexapro for over a year and have noticed that I&#039;m actually not &quot;freaking out&quot; about everything.  I&#039;m happy for every day that I&#039;m here and thankful for every moment I have.  I only wish I would have approached my doctor before to ask for help.  This little pill made a huge difference."
