"I was really suicidal before I started this and its helped me a LOT. I take this for my anxiety also and I don&#039;t find that it helps but it does help with my depression. I had problems with self harm and ripping my hair out before I started lexapro and I haven&#039;t relapsed on that. This medication has also helped a ton with my anger issues."
