"I have been taking 10 MG daily for just over 3 weeks now. My doctor said it usually takes 4-6 weeks to work, but I swear I started feeling better after only TWO doses! At first it made me feel lazy but that is going away now. I usually have a bit of anxiety and depression all month long, but I am legitimately emotionally unstable and mentally INSANE right before and during my period. In the past three weeks since being on this medicine, I have had a few small bouts of depression but I haven&#039;t felt any &quot;deep emotional pain&quot; like I usually do. My feelings of intense desperation and loneliness are gone! I did get angry at my mother a few days ago, but I was able to calm down MUCH faster than I normally would. I hope this continues to help!"
