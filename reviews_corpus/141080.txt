"I was prescribed Cipralex previously for depression.  After taking it for only one day I was awake for 35 hours and had the worst panic attack of my life along with severe anxiety (way worse than what I was used to) and shaking.  I was so &quot;foggy&quot; during this whole time it felt like I wasn&#039;t in my own body.  I have been on Zoloft now for almost a month and it has been a completely different experience, I&#039;m finally getting my life back now.  Cipralex just didn&#039;t react well with me."
