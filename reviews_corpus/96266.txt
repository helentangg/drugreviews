"I wanted to share my experience with Zoloft because I came to this website looking for reviews when I first started. I had my doubts at first, my doctor started me out slow at 50mg. Now I am up to 150mg. It has taken a good 5 weeks for me to finally feel a change. I actually woke up in a good mood the past few days. Let me tell you I spent a lot of days staying in my sweats all day watching TV thinking I was never going to feel better. For me it just took a really long time to take effect.  The only side effect I have had is in the bedroom dept. Takes FOREVER if at all to have any fireworks go off for me, which was never a problem. Its really weird, but other than that no other side effects. I hope to feel even better each day."
