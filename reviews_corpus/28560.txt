"I am a female, in high school, 5&quot;9 210 pounds. I had been dealing with anxiety for my whole life. I went to a therapist and it helped a little but it wasn&#039;t enough to make a dramatic difference. I finally decided to go to a psychiatrist and got diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, and I also suffer from separation anxiety, some OCD, and social anxiety.  I went on Lexapro 5mg for one week then went to 5mg in the morning and 5mg at night. I have been on that dose for over a month and am night and day from how I was. I am finally the happy go lucky relaxed person my dad says he knew existed deep down. I have no complaints other than wishing I had started it years ago. I noticed a difference after one week. I recommend it 100%."
