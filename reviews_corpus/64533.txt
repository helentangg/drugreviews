"I have been taking Zoloft for panic disorder/agoraphobia for just over a year. Literally best decision EVER!!! I&#039;m on 50mg and had side effects (loss of appetite, nausea, tight jaw) for about a month but they COMPLETELY went away after that. And none of the side effects were honestly that big of a deal to me. It took about a solid 8 weeks for me to fully feel like it was working so hang in there if at the 6th week mark you don&#039;t feel much different! Zoloft has CHANGED my life. I can&#039;t even begin to describe it. I haven&#039;t had a panic attack since I started the medicine. I read so many reviews on so many different sites. All i can say is do not give up. I&#039;m SOO glad I stuck it out. If Zoloft doesn&#039;t work, try another! *But patience is KEY."
