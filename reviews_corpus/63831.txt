"Day 4 if taking a small dosage (prescribed 50mg but from past experience with medication I decided to quarter the tablets to ease into the side effects). First day I got heartburn for a few hours and slight tingles in my face and hands, nothing major. Day two was fine. Day three I had some diarrhoea which settled after a few hours. Day four (today) I feel terrible, I have diarrhoea, stomach cramps, nausea, headache &amp; muscle aches. I feel like a big bag of urgh. I&rsquo;m on such a tiny dose I don&rsquo;t know whether to keep going or stop. My panic disorder stems from a fear of being sick so I&rsquo;m thinking of just stopping unless this settles and I feel brave enough tomorrow to go through the same thing"
