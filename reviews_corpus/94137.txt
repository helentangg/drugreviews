"After trying dozens of other meds with no results, my doctor prescribed me Brintellix.  I was started on 5mg a day and worked my way up to 20mg a day.  Even at the lowest dose of 5mg, I started  to notice my depression lifting and my anxiety reducing.  I became more social on it as well.  The higher the dose the better I got.  It took about a month to feel a major change."
