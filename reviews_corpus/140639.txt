"I tried it for the first time due to anxiety. It made me tired and weak, &amp; I knew was a possibility, so I took it just before bedtime. I laid down but was unable to sleep due to a horrible headache coming on shortly after. It felt similar to blood rushing to the head when hanging upside down. I was dizzy &amp; anxious due to this, so got out of bed to get my partner. I only made it a few steps from my bed to the hallway before I passed out. I only remember needing to get help, then I woke up with him holding me sideways to keep me still from convulsing &amp; choking on my tongue. I&#039;ve never had any issue with fainting, convulsions, or seizures prior. I won&#039;t be taking this again. Ever."
