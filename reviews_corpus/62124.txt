"I started this medication in February for stress and anxiety. I was worrying about anything and everything. I couldn&#039;t sleep, eat or no motivation for months. I was put on 10mg and feel so much better. I am happy again, sleeping and no longer sick on a morning. It took a while with some ups and downs along the way but stick with it because its worth it in the end!"
