Very good and very effective. Taking Lexapro since 2009.  Few problems. Have a very serious depression/minor schizo-psychosis problem. Took generic and am taking Lexapro again. Had a few problems with generic.    

Don&#039;t have same calm reaction with generic. Lexapro puts me in a good mood most of the time.  Feeling of equilibrium mentally.  Am happier/relaxed/calmer. Does make me very sleepy/drowsy, &amp; a few other minor side effects. Only antidepressant I have had few problems with.  Able to be more relaxed. Can fall asleep in a matter of minutes instead of hours. Have had a very good experience with it. Trying to get insurance to pay for it."
