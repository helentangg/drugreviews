"I&#039;ve been on Sertraline for about two years. I was originally taking 50mg and now I&#039;m on 200mg. It DOES help my depression a great deal but doesn&#039;t really seem to do much for my anxiety. When I first started taking 200mg (from 150mg) I did feel slightly manic for about a week but then I calmed down a lot."
