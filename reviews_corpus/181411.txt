"Been on this medicine for 2 weeks now and definitely starting to feel less anxious and I&#039;m not making a mountain out of a molehill anymore!! Also not as afraid in social situations and ocd that someone will break in my house and kidnap me and my kids is gone and I can actually sleep at night now. I hope this continues because living in constant fear is no way to live!"
