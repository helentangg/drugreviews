"For posterity, I&#039;m currently also taking Wellbutrin, Trazodone, and I&#039;ll be starting Vyvanse soon. Past SSRI&#039;s include Prozac and Zoloft; Prozac worked great but then pooped out and Zoloft didn&#039;t do much of anything. My depression and anxiety have easily tripled over the past couple due to being sexually assaulted and the deaths of two very close friends. As a result, I get agitated extremely easily at work and feel extremely low and hopeless at home. I&#039;m currently taking 20 mg Lexapro and I believe I just felt it kick in? It&#039;s like a warm hug for the brain. I&#039;m not feeling irritable, I&#039;m fairly relaxed, and I&#039;m excited for the rest of my day. I feel like it&#039;s only going to get better from here."
