"Went in for a routine check up a year ago and told my doctor something has been up and I don&#039;t feel right.   Asa medical student myself, I knew something was up and wasn&#039;t going to leave without answers. I explained what was going on and what has been going through my head, and she diagnosed me with depression. I have felt the way I&#039;ve felt for 11 years because at the young age of 8 I almost lost my dad in a motorcycle accident and the doctors led me to believe I had. I became a recluse... my emotions took over... I got perscribed Vilazodone, and took it up until recently and realized it did NOTHING for me. It was supposed to balance my serotonin levels in my brain that cause depression and anxiety, but it only made me feel worse."
