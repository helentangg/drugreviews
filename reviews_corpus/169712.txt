"I can&#039;t sleep worth anything so they took me off ambien to this saying it works well..I have to take up 125mg a night to fall asleep and it doens&#039;t work. I get bad headaches and I didn&#039;t take it for two days so I could have some drinks with a friend well it got me mad and sad and all of it almost ruined me relationship. Ever since being on this and paxil has not been good for me it made things worse."
