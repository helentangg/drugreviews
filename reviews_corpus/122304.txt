"I take a 2.5mg tablet of Selegiline with breakfast and it has helped with depression and fatigue. I cut a 5 mg tablet in half.  If I miss the morning dose, I try not to take it any later than noon because it keeps me up at night.  I tried 5mg to start but I didn&#039;t feel right and had insomnia. I also take a 1 to 2 day break after taking it for 5 days straight."
