"I was on Paxil and switched to Lexapro a few years back (3) and have not had many side affects. It really does calm me down so I have become a nicer person, and shrug off things that I would normally go crazy about, less shouting etc. I take 20mg. I do feel it has made me lazier and as a result I have been putting on some weight as I exercise less. It does affect orgasms which are much harder to pull off and takes incredible effort. I tried 3 times to go off the drug cold turkey, with terrible results. I just became depressed. After a few days I just went back on it again and after 15 minutes felt the glow of calm come into my body and I was &quot;normal&quot; again.  It is addictive, to quit, definitely need to decrease dose gradually."
