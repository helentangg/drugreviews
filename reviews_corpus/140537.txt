"I was taking Lexapro for years up until 2013 when I was brave enough to try to get off of it.  I successfully got off after a long and gradual dose cutting process.  I&#039;ve been doing well until a recent bump in the road that sent me down into a hole.  I went to my doctor and took my first dose yesterday.  Holy hell wagon!  I&#039;ve honestly never felt worse in my entire life.  This drug showed me what depressed really means.  My ears were ringing, extremeties felt like they were being electrocuted, lethargic, and a feeling of utter devastation came over me.  All these feelings just came rushing to the surface.  All this guilt I felt about breaking up with my ex.  I reached out to her last night and we might get back together.  Maybe worth it?"
