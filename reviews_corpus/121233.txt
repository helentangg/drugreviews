"Effexor XR didnt change my life... as much as it made me &quot;me&quot; again.  Previously i was on Paxil which &quot;kind of&quot; worked, but not enough.  I started small on the effexor, and i gradually worked my way up to the point where i take 300mg a day and i&#039;ve been taking that dose now for years.  I can now drive a car, hold down a job, hold a conversation, be in a relationship, etc.  I was scared of everything... living really.  Not a drug to stop taking suddenly.  Bad bad bad idea.  I get &quot;the sleeps&quot; still, and if i am lucky enough to get them when i dont have to do anything else... best sleep i ever had.  I&#039;m a 37 year old male, sex drive is still pretty decent.  Only side effects that i feel are vivid dreams, and the sleeps"
