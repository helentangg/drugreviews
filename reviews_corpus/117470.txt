"I&#039;m taking Pamelor (that&#039;s the generic name) primarily for migraine prevention but it also helps my depression. It&#039;s been about three months since I started this and my migraines have reduced a lot.  I rarely get them now.  I&#039;m also feeling much better since my depression. The only side effect I have is sleepiness in the mornings. Other than that it&#039;s a charm."
