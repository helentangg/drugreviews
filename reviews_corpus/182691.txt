"Was put on this for anxiety/pain. Although it did help with anxiety, it made me very weak in the legs.  So much so that I can&#039;t stand it. I am prescribed 60 mg, but I take 15 mg to keep the edge off. Im told weakness in muscles is not a side effect. Garbage ! I see in some comments that few others have it. Doctors act like we don&#039;t know our own bodies. ...So frustrating!"
