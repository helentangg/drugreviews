"I have been on sertraline for 4 weeks now. I started on 6 mg...yes I cut up the pills into 1/8! After 1 day of nausea I felt much better. After 2 weeks I moved up to 12.5 mg. still feeling great. I wish I had done this years ago. While my main problem is anxiety, on reflection I have  been depressed for years. Hope the very low dose continues to work. Life is just so much better, I am not constrained by wanting to go home all the time and most amazing anxiety over ridiculous things like waiting in line, etc."
