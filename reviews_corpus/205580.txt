"I have suffered with severe depression for at least 25 years. I wasn&#039;t willing to admit that I needed help...just kept trying to power through it. The past year has been a nightmare. I went to a family doctor and was prescribed Wellbutrin. Felt like I was on the verge of becoming psychotic within 1 week. I stopped taking the medicine and just gutted it out. Barely hanging on. Barely surviving. My wife convinced me to go to a psychiatrist and I was prescribed Pristiq. Following my first dose, my life has changed! I never knew how bad off I was until I started taking Pristiq. Before I was SUFFERING everyday of my life. I now feel hope. I now feel confident. I now want to do things with my family. I now have renewed interest in my job. Pristiq has changed my life. I can&#039;t believe it. I am so thankful that I have this medicine. I&#039;m kicking myself for not getting help sooner."
