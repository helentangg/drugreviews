"Nardil works very well for my bipolar depression. I had hypersomnia when I was depressed and the drugs I tried (Lamictal, Zoloft, Celexa&hellip;) didn&rsquo;t help at all. I&rsquo;m glad my psychiatrist made me try this medication. 
At first, I took 45 mg, but after a while, it made me maniac. I had to lower the dosage to 30 mg and, surprisingly, it&rsquo;s seems to be working (even though it&rsquo;s not considered as a therapeutic dose).
The diet is very easy to follow, as long as you can take bottled beer. The only downside is the sugar cravings, which are difficult to resist."
