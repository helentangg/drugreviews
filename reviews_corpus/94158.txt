"I have been on this drug for 2 months now. I have had no side affects at all. I am calmer my anxiety has greatly reduced. Hopefully as I&#039;m on the drug longer I will feel like my old self again. The only issue I have is with the cost!!! I have a high deductible plan and my out of pocket cost are around $260.00"
