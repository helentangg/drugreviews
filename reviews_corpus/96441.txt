"Zoloft worked for me at first, but then I had what my Doctor said was &quot;medication burnout,&quot; so it stopped working.  He switched me from Zoloft to Prozac (both of which I am off now).  I took them together for a week so I could taper off the Zoloft.  He told me that taking them together would reduce withdrawal symptoms, but it didn&#039;t.  I had horrible withdrawal from Zoloft.  I have never done crack, but I felt like I had.  I was sweating, my pupils were huge, and I was shaking for a good 10 hours; I also had bad vertigo for a week.  I think it would have been a lot worse if I was just trying to get off Zoloft. My withdrawal from Prozac has been definitely better. "
