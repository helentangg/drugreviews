"This drug literally saved my life, from suicidal to loving and living life again. It was quite quick acting too, my anxiety after a week was way less and each week it just was less and less. After 6 weeks I&#039;m almost high on life, endless energy, I laugh, can love and hug my kids again, and feel like ME again, and realise how many years it&#039;s been since I felt like me.
BUT the side effects :( I&#039;m really gutted because this drug has worked a miracle, but the longer I&#039;m on it the worst the side effects become.  Stabbing aching pains in muscles in arms and legs, feet, massive bladder spasms and bladder leaking (Never had bladder issues before) and sleep is effected badly too, I wake up wide awake a lot and can&#039;t sleep past 4am"
