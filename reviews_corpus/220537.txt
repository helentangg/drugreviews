"I&#039;m 43 and have had migraines since I was 23. I&#039;ve tried everything, even preventatives (Topamax - hated it) and finally found Frova to be really effective. Then I recently got one migraine that Frova couldn&#039;t keep away for more than 12 hours. After 8 weeks of undulating pain, I tried amitriptyline and my migraine finally disappeared after only 2 days. I was also able to get a full night&#039;s sleep. Been on 10mg for two weeks now and feel almost back to my normal self again. The drowsiness subsided after about a week. I will occasionally get the sensation that I&#039;m getting a migraine, but it dissipates quickly. No issues with weight gain yet - I actually lost about 10 pounds, but it could be because I&#039;ve been doing more sleeping than eating lately."
