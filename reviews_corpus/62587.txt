"I took Celexa for the 2nd time today and threw up within 1 hour. The first time same thing. For some odd reason I am yawning more that usual and every time I yawn I want to throw up. It causes severe upset stomach and causes it to come out both ends. I sure hope this stops soon or I would rather deal with anxiety and stress alone because this is far worse."
