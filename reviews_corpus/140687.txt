"I experienced &quot;poop out&quot; after being on Lexapro for 7 years.  I was prescribed 150 mg of Welbutren, which was upped to 300mg.  The Lexapro kicked in after a few weeks, and worked like a charm.  After one year, my anxiety and depression returned progressively getting worse over a period of three months.  Finally realized my insurance switched me to the generic escitalopram. I had been taking it for three months without realizing it! Requested to switch back to Lexapro, however, Tricare insurance would not cover it so had to pay almost 178 per month for brand name.  That was two years ago.  Now pay 294 per month. Tricare still will not pay.  Considering buying from Canada."
