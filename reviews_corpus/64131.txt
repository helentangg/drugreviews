"I started on 25mg for 7 days and had a few good days. Increased to 50mg and have begun yo feel even better. I&#039;m not 100% yet but Zoloft has been the first AD to have a positive effect in such a short time with minimal side effects. I have tried and had awful reactions to Paxil, tritellix, Effexor, Remeron, Trazadone, Wellbutrin. Cipralex worked but pooped after 1.5 years and increasing the dosage did nothing and maybe I was worse. Clonazapam was really awful. Lorazapam worked for isolated anxiety but only made my anxiety even worse after a while due to tolerance and rebound effects. Stay away from benzos but if you have to take them, don&#039;t take them more than once or twice over month. I started taking them daily and this was a huge mistake."
