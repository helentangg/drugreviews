"I have severe Diabetic Neuropathy to both feet, and Neurotin seemed rather ineffective. The pain was a combination of burning, needles and pins sensation, and severe knife stabbing sensations intermittently to both feet. I started taking Cymbalta over a year ago, and it has significantly reduced the sensations and pain,  making them tolerable. I initially noticed a loss of appetite, which was a blessing in disguise for me, and I lost 25 pounds before the anorexia disappeared. I have several severe disorders which require close monitoring of my blood, but overall, Cymbalta has been a God send to me."
