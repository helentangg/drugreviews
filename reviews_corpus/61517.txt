"I was started on citalopram at 20mg.  The first one I took made me feel like I was &quot;high&quot;, but that was pretty much the only side effect I felt that first week, besides a lot of yawning.  I was prescribed 30mg after a month of being on 20mg, to help deal with my social anxiety.  I&#039;ve been on 30mg for about 3 months now and I feel amazing.  I&#039;ve felt anxiety all my life and its only until now my anxiety has lessened to almost the point of non-existence. I feel &quot;normal&quot;, I can talk to anyone, I smile at everyone I meet.  Everything is amazing!  I hope your journey is as great as well! ♡♡♡"
