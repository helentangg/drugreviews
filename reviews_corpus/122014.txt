"I took Effexor XL about a year ago for about 6 months. At first, it worked great. Then, I got sick and couldn&#039;t take it for a couple days, and OMG the withdrawal. I felt like I was going to pass out, and throw up. I was dizzy. It was awful, and it took two more days of taking it before those feelings went away.  I finally decided to talk my doctor about getting off the Effexor. I had to step down at half dose intervals and in turn, go through the withdrawals 3 times over the time frame of three weeks. Just as the withdrawals subsided from one cut, I had to cut again. "
