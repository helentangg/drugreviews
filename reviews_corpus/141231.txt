"I&#039;ve been on Lexapro for two weeks now and I can definitely say that my life has been so much better. I&#039;m on 10 mg and I take one every day. I haven&#039;t had any negative side effects expect on my first day taking it I felt dizzy and a little spaced out but they subsided by day 3. Lexapro saved my life! I use to cry everyday and think so much but now all of that has stopped. I&#039;m feeling better, sleeping better; life is just better. Give it a try if you have depression/anxiety."
