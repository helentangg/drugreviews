"I am 34 years old.  and originally started this for Depression &amp; anxiety. Panic attacks I started this medication when I  was 20 years old. Yes I have been on it that long!! This medication is severely addictive - it should be banned. I feel dt&#039;s so so hard 2 get off. I have tried so many times. I get brain zaps, sweats, panic attacks, hot flushes, dizziness, paranoia, tiredness, anger  to be honest first couple years I felt was a miracle drug as I was confined to my bedroom at home. Once started taking this it did help me to move into my own place.  Over years I have tried to get off it. And in that process I get so down it&#039;s that bad. I be so paranoid can&#039;t have kids around me. Thank god my Dr now helping me and I now take buspirone. And slowly coming of paroxetine. Feel have better support now."
