"I started taking this because of my generalized anxiety disorder that started out of nowhere and led to mild depression. After the first week or two of my head feeling weird, it kicked in and has put me back to my old self, with added benefits like not being quite as socially anxious and an overall better mood. The only side effect I noticed was that when I get drunk enough, instead of just getting super sloppy (not able to walk), I will just black out for a while. Also, I am fine when I miss one day. I have only skipped one day at a time before, so I wouldn&#039;t know the effects of missing more than one dose. Overall, I am very glad I went on this medicine."
