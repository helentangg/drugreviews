"I personally didn&#039;t like this medication as it made me so sick I couldn&#039;t eat lost weight and generally felt weak due lack of energy from not eating. Although my GP told me this was a rare occurrence as the side effects generally stop after a couple of days after weeks they didn&#039;t. Still looking for a medication that suits me personally. Glad it has been effective so many others"
