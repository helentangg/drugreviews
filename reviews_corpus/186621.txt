"I have mixed feelings about this medication. I had taken Pristiq for almost 6 months.  The side effects of a headache daily, nausea, the night sweats, teeth hurting, jaw clenching. The 1st month I was so tired, taking a nap  shortly after the dose.  I have to admit I wasn&#039;t so emotional to the point of crying at the drop of trying situation. I then had Topomax added as well, it seemed okay for a couple of months until I just wasn&#039;t myself at all. I made the hasty action to stop all the medicines which I must say, do not do this.  The withdrawal effects were terrible to say the least. I strongly suggest seeking medical advice on taking this action."
