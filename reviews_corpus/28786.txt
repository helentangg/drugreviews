"This medication has given me my life back!  I had crippling anxiety.  I never could sleep more than 2-4 hrs a night, was constantly fearful, and had daily panic attacks.  My anxious thoughts had become so obsessive, I couldn&#039;t even function.  Within a week of starting Lexapro, my irrational fears and obsessive thoughts started to decrease significantly, and after about a month, I was starting to feel &quot;normal&quot; again.  I have been on it for about 5 months now and I finally feel balanced (and haven&#039;t had a single panic attack).  Only complaints are that it makes me fairly sleepy often and sometimes I have weird dreams.  But the benefits FAR outweigh the side effects."
