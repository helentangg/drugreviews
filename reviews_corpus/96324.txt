"On my first week of using sertraline and so far side effects include dizziness, nausea, and insomnia. On the upscale I don&#039;t have any angry or violent outbursts. About an hour after taking it I saw it&#039;s effects almost immediately. All those little things don&#039;t bother me so much anymore. Have never felt this way so it&#039;s a strange experience."
