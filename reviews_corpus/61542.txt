"My life has been a disaster.  Recently diagnosed with bipolar, spent most of my life aware of something wrong, but unaware of what it was and mostly unaware of how I affected others.  Started citalopram a year ago, and caught fleeting glances of my condition. Then figured out that why my life has been such a bucket of poo, even though on paper I had accomplished a great deal.  No matter what I did, where I went, the sick I was always there.  Have tried other cures but they didn&#039;t work as well as citalopram.  Lithium helped some.  Others left my mouth dry (very bad for the teeth), gave me headaches, and made my heart race.  So here I am,  having to cuddle with a dragon and a psychic one at that."
