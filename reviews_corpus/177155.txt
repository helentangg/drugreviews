"I have arthritis, neuropathy, fibromyalgia and depression. I have been taking Humira for my arthritis which caused heart failure.  I had stopped taking the Cymbalta for a while because I was trying to cut back on medication. And I couldn&#039;t figure out why my arthritis felt so horrible as soon as I started to take the Cymbalta again my arthritis is so much better. It actually works better than the Humira did and better than the Lyrica that I am taking for my neuropathy. So I actually discovered how well it works accidentally. But it&#039;s so nice to be able to walk around again with so much less pain."
