"A little over two years due to a job change and move, I suffered many anxiety/panic attacks.  One of them landed me in the ER.  I was then diagnosed with depression.  I was put on Pristiq and with time it started working.  I took the medication for about 18 months and then very slowly went off.  I don&#039;t like being dependent on medication.  My main reason for going off was my sex drive.  You are very limited as to what you can take while on antidepressants.  I am starting to feel like I am slipping into depression once again so will probably start again.  Pristiq worked wonders for me."
