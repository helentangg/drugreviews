"Being on Prozac was a nightmare experience.  I have something called adjustment disorder with depressive episodes and anxiety attacks.  My psychiatrist put me on 10mg to start with in conjunction with my Wellbutrin.  The first week was fine and then I went up to 20mg.  I started feeling restless and anxious all the time and my appetite was completely gone - I didn&#039;t want to eat at all.  I had to literally force feed myself and I was losing weight rapidly.  Then, over a month later, I had increasingly bad rage episodes where I would scream at people for no reason whatsoever.  I yelled at a total stranger while driving and then had a panic attack .  Stopped the drug and it went away."
