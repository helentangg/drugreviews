"Started on fluoxetine a month ago, 20mg.  Felt very tired the first week and nothing else.  Just started taking 40 mg a few days ago.  My wife swears she notices a difference, says she doesn&#039;t feel like she&#039;s walking on egg shells around me anymore.  One thing I&#039;ve noticed is things I used to dwell on, I can now think about them but now put them out of my mind relatively easy.  Before the meds I would dwell on things, couldn&#039;t escape the negative thoughts.  Things that are out of my control don&#039;t haunt me nearly as much"
