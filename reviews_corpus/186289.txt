"For all of those who are hesitant to start... don&#039;t be. After only one day on Pristiq I became aware of how imbalanced my brain was and how totally irrational my thoughts were. I know it&#039;s hard to admit that you need it, but there is no need to suffer so much. I had almost no side effects (it is day 4 now) and I feel much more confident and calm, no more compulsive crying and victimization. They say it gets better after 3 weeks, if that&#039;s the case and I already feel great, I can&#039;t wait!"
