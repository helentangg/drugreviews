"Currently being 15, I&#039;ve had migraines about everyday since I was 11 and I was prescribed this medication a few months ago. It worked okay for a few weeks, most days of the week I&#039;d be migraine free. Now though, I get my daily migraines regardless of taking it and I believe I&#039;ve been heavily hallucinating for the past month or two and I had a night terror. And because of these hallucinations, I haven&#039;t been able to sleep well. I get maybe 4-5 hours of sleep everyday.
The only positive aspect I can think of is that its helped me socialize better, I&#039;m not so nervous about speaking anymore."
