"I have been taking Prozac for two months.  The first month I did not notice a difference but after 6 weeks I was not obsessing or getting angry and noticed I was more relaxed around other people.  Being a shy person from the day I was born, I am still not interested in anymore social interaction, however I have noticed that I am now extremely tired on the Prozac which is debilitating and frustrating since I have an exam to write in 10 days and have no motivation to study.  I have lots of energy when I am exercising so I don&#039;t think it&#039;s due to low iron or nutritional deficiencies.  Went to doctor today and he recommended I stay on it for another month so the medicine normalizes in my body."
