"I have insomnia and fibromyalgia. The pain from the fibromyalgia is worsened when I can&#039;t sleep well.  My doctor prescribed this medication to me mainly for better sleep. He said that this medication was one of the first non-stimulant medication for ADHD (which I&#039;ve been diagnosed with) and so it may help with my ADHD symptoms as well.  When I first started taking this I felt nauseated all the time, for about 2 1/2 weeks.  Once that passed I felt like I really was sleeping better.  About 2 months in I started having vivid hallucinations and 6 months I started having kidney pain and urinary tract problems.  I&#039;m now trying to ween myself off of it because sadly the side effects are outweighing the better sleep."
