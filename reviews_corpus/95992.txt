"Full-blown panic attack at age 33, prescribed Xanax 0.25 mg for several years. No problems but general anxiety still existed.  Went off medication several times and within one year of each attempt other panic attacks set in; solely prescribed 100 mg Sertraline.  Have never had another panic attack but have gotten close to experiencing one several times. Am now 66 years of age.  What a boon this medication has been for me!"
