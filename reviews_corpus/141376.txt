"Lexapro has been a major positive in my life. I&#039;ve suffered from depression for over 10 years now and taking this pill has solved so many issues I didn&#039;t even know where to begin to diagnose myself. My head became stable and generally positive and happy everyday. Its almost impossible to feel THAT down anymore. Another few positives has been that it has helped me slow way way down on my smoking and I have no real desire to drink alcohol, not that I&#039;m free from stress. My sexual desire has actually INCREASED. When you are so stressed all the time your sex drive normally goes down, so now that I am released from stress because of this pill I&#039;m doing things I was never able to do before."
