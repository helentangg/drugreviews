"I tried so many medications before like prozac and zoloft. I can&#039;t remember the rest but they made me sick or suicidal. I&#039;ve been on Paxil CR 12.5 for 10 yrs and never increased and it is the best one for me. I cannot live my life without paxil. It has made me a better person, mother, sister, and friend."
