"Im 28 yr old male. I was always depressed everyday and hating everything in the world. My girlfriend forced me to get help so the doctor put me on Lexapro 10 mg. This is my third day on it. I have to say I feel better. The only side effects I am having is stomach pains, sweating and feeling very tired. But I am feeling more positive about things now. I am just shocked how fast it has helped me. The only put back about this pill is and not be able to orgasm. I would recommend this pill to anybody that is depressed all the time. "
