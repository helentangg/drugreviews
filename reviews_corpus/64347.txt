"I was prescribed setraline for post natal depression and anxiety. At the start i felt irritable, more anxious, nausea, had severe diahrrea and my insomnia got worse.
Two months on i am getting less than four hours sleep a night. Not a good combination with a lively toddler. I still get diahrrea but not as severe and my anxiety levels have decreased dramatically. However i still struggle with everyday tasks/chores/eating etc. I have also noticed my depression increases drastically for three weeks every month, when my period is due. I am seeing my doctor shortly and hope to switch to something that might allow me to sleep. I can cope with everything but sleep deprivation. Three years of less than four hours sleep a night is not good."
