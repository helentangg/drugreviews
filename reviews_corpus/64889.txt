"This has been a life changer for me. I guess I never realized how depressed I actually was until I started on Zoloft. I&#039;d been fighting it for years, forcing myself to get up and get by each day, but getting worse and worse (avoiding people, having problems talking, having horrible insomnia).
Within a week of being on Zoloft I noticed a major difference. I actually feel optimistic about life for the first time in as long as I can remember. My relationships with my wife, family, friends, and coworkers have all improved dramatically. In short, I&#039;m no longer depressed. 
I had some side effects over the first few days (restless legs, night sweats, a zonked out &#039;zombie&#039; feeling) but they passed quickly."
