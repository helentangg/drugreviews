"Severe anxiety to the extent I could not sleep at night, coupled with depression probably brought on by the lack of sleep.  I have been taking lexapro for 2 weeks now and it has already working.  I now sleep a solid 7 hrs, and I feel improvement with my anxiety and depression every day. I cannot recommend lexapro enough - fantastic. Side effects lasted for approx 9 days, these included very dry throat, headaches , vivid dreams and extreme hunger. Side effects have almost all subsided and I&#039;m feeling great"
