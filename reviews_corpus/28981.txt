"I have had Bipolar disorder since I was 14 and never knew what it was. about 4 years ago I asked my Doc for something to help with depression and he prescribed 10 MG of Lexapro. I couldn&#039;t believe how much it helped.  He bumped me up to 20mg a day (I&#039;m 6ft , 250 lbs).When I went to a rehab where they prescribed a lot more meds wich eventually had very bad side effects so I was pulled off of it and switched to welabutrin.I think this drug works great alone but watch for other drug reactions."
