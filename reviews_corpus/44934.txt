"this drug I rate 10/10 because it wakes your brain up from the dead anxiety isn&#039;t that simple, it slows you from growing mentally and expanding because it becomes apart of your life and you lose focus on everything else. I found this to be a miracle drug for anxiety. Not so much for depression because it can cause suicidal thoughts to some degree. Prozac changed my life and career I could not be more satisfied with the result of decreased anxiety."
