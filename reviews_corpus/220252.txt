"I have been taking 25mg amitriptyline for over a year now. My migraines have almost disappeared which is very good as I was having 2 a month lasting up to 3 days each. I&#039;ve had Migraines since I was 14 and had hoped that I would start to get better after the age of 60. But not so I&#039;m 68 now and will continue the pills though I&#039;m worried about long term use. I get it on the national health here."
