"I was diagnosed with depression about 6 months ago and started with a very low dose of prozac. About 3 months later I was institutionalized and switched to Zoloft. Most of the people there for depression were on it and it worked for them. However, it does not work for me at all. I&#039;ve been on 100 mg for about 2 months and I feel jittery when I sit for too long or when I&#039;m trying to sleep, I get really grouchy and rude (which is unusual for me) , and things that only bothered me before make me really depressed."
