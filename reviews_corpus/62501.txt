"I started taking Citalopram about 3 months ago. I am now on 20mg. I had some side effects within the first week (couldn&#039;t sleep, etc.) however those wore off after a few days and I no longer have any side effects. After 3 months I can say that I can definitely notice the benefits. I feel like the full effects started kicking in for me after 2-3 months. I still feel like myself, but I no longer have extreme anxiety or feelings of impending doom like I previously had. I&#039;m relatively relaxed most of the time and don&#039;t worry as much.

Before I was anti-medication, but after feeling helpless and realizing that therapy was not helping, I can say I&#039;m glad I started taking this medication."
