"I have been living with chronic back and hip pain for 12 years. I have had many surgeries with little to no relief of pain. After being in the pain management program at Kaiser for 2 months the doctor prescribed nortriptyline and within days I felt like a new person.  Even just sitting doing nothing was painful and now I can do my daily household chores with little pain.  Some things are still difficult but my daily life has improved substantially."
