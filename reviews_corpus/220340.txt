"I&#039;m 59 years old and have suffered with migraines as well as hard to get rid of &quot;regular&quot; daily headaches since my early teens. A three day migraine would loose 9 pounds for me. I had been to countless doctors and a neurologist with no triggers found. No one ever tried a preventive medication for me. Finally, four years ago, my VA doctor suggested Amitriptyline. It&#039;s been a lifesaver. He suggested building up to 30 mg per day at bedtime. I developed dry mouth, eyes and throat as well as nosebleeds. I reduced to 10 mgs with good results as far as the headache and migraine relief, but still the side effects. Cut the pills in half with good results. So, now I&#039;m taking 5 mg per day, with virtually no side effects and NO headaches at all."
