"I have been taking 5mg for three days and will bump up to 10mg soon. So far the only side effects I&#039;ve noticed are dry mouth and increased appetite, I&#039;m feeling pretty hopeful about this one. I take it at night because it makes me a little sleepy but I also feel a little energized at the same time, it hasn&#039;t effected my sleep at all. I sleep wonderfully and wake up feeling good."
