"I&#039;ve been on Paxil for about 6 months now. It helps a lot with anxiety, although it isn&#039;t gone completely. I honestly feel like the longer I take it, the more it helps. Even after 6 months I still think my anxiety is improving. I tried Buspirone before Paxil and it made me feel too uncomfortable to continue taking. 

Pros:
Haven&#039;t had a Panic Attack in a long time, anxiety is about 90% better

Cons:
Constipation, harder to orgasm, (These started out bad and slowly seem to be getting better). I&#039;ve gained about 5 lbs so far but my appetite has really picked up. I will probably end up gaining more. 

Lots of reviews say it is very hard to quit. I have not tried to quit yet."
