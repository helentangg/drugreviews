"DO NOT TAKE!!! THIS MEDICATION RUINED MY LIFE IN THE SPACE OF A MONTH! It made me more depressed, agitated, irritable, lose my appetite, anxious beyond belief.... and that&#039;s only on the lowest dose! I cannot believe, in all my experience with depression, that an &#039;antidepressant&#039; can make someone feel so depressed."
