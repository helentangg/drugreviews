"I&#039;ve been on Paxil for 3 days and I honestly can say I&#039;ve been sleep mostly. Jaws are clicking. But I feel calm .. I hope it works out for Me. I also started meditations so I&#039;ve been real spaced out. I can barely live my life with my anxiety. I will definitely post in 2 weeks with my progress."
