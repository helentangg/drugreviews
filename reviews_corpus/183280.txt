"I have been on Cymbalta for 10 weeks now.  I started at 30 then went to 60.  I was feeling wonderful, less negative, less worried, it was great.  However the last 10 days or so I have started clenching my teeth, severe nausea, horrible dreams, weight gain and dizziness.  I don&#039;t want to go back to the way I was feeling before, however I can&#039;t continue feeling this way either!"
