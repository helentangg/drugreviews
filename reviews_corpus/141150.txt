"27 y/o Male in good health and exercise regularly.  I was put on Escitalopram after experiencing a few panic attacks and heightened overall anxiety.  I&#039;ve never really had a history with panic attacks prior to this.  I was going through a big job change and a lot of personal stress.  Then the sudden death of a close family member sent me into a weak and hopeless period in my life.  Blood tests showed low Vit-D and Low-Test as well.  I&#039;ve been on Escitalopram for about 7 months now and am feeling much better.  Although I have experienced an annoying extra 10lbs of belly fat as well as a reduced libido and lower motivation.  I started at 10mg and will be slowly tapering off over the next 2-3 mos.  Took about 6-8 weeks to work in full."
