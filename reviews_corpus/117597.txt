"This drug worked great.I was about to lose my job. At first I had very little side effects that didn&#039;t bother me. It stopped the loose bowel movements and the stomach pain every time I would eat. Had hard lumpy poops still no pain and a lot better than worrying if I was going to make it to a bathroom. After a year and a half not sure if it was cause of PMS (which never had an problem, a little crabby nothing more) I had a severe panic, anxiety, could not think almost psychotic. So cut my dose in half for a week and then stopped taking it and four days later IBS is back. DR is going to try something else but if it don&#039;t work I&#039;m going to go back and risk the mental issues."
