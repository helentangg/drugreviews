"Started taking Celexa on August 14th. Within 2 days I broke out in hives on my collar bone then within a week I had severe hives on my arms and spreading. Within a couple of days I had hives on my legs and back. Dr. didn&#039;t think it was the Celexa so continued it and ended up in the emergency room with worse side effects vomiting!  Emergency room declared I had a severe allergic reaction to Celexa. "
