"I&#039;ve been on it 3 times. For 8 years, then again for a little less than a year 2 diff times. For depression and anxiety.  First starting it I always got nausea and killer headaches. But then they would get better and eventually go away. The first few months of taking it I would feel better. Happier, more energy etc. But then as months went on I would become more numb to things. No highs or lows. Just zombie mode. Very spacy and forgetful. Running red lights, forgetting to go to class or work. No sex drive. Tired. Failed my classes.  The most recent time I was on it it really helped with my depression but it actually caused me to have OCD. I had OCD as a child but hadn&#039;t had it in forever. Thought that was weird it triggered it to come back."
