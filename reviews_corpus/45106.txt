"Tried fluoxetine 20mg for a month.  Absolutely did NOT work for me!!! I lost a few pounds which was water weight but gained it right back and some.  Made anxiety,  obsessive thoughts worse,  depression worse too. Got to a point where I thought I was gonna walk right out of my job.  Stopped taking it a day ago and i already feel better,  maybe even hypomanic.it gets a 2 instead of 1 cuz it allowed me to sleep. I will be starting a combo of venlafaxine 75mg and bupropion 150 mg sr in a few days.  Hopefully I won&#039;t resist this treatment. Good luck everyone!"
