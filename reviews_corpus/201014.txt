"I&#039;ve got severe PTSD, OCD and social anxiety.

I started taking Zoloft to help manage my PTSD symptoms, mainly anger/rage, flashbacks and dissociation.

I&#039;m a small male, I only weigh 125 lbs. I started at 25mg and then jumped to 100mg then 200mg within 2 months because this stuff&#039;s like water for me. I&#039;ve been on 200mg for about 7 months now and it&#039;s helped a lot although not enough. I still feel my symptoms when they hit me, although they&#039;re slightly toned down.

Btw I don&#039;t feel like a zombie at all, I still feel like myself, just more calm. It feels as though I&#039;m not taking anything at all most of the time.

I&#039;ve basically also never had any side effects except the first day or two I had a slight sore stomach but nothing close to bad."
