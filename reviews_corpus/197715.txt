"What a great antidepressant! No side effects and I actually feel happy. My mood swings have improved and I feel calm and happy inside. Things that used to irritate me, don&#039;t anymore. I can tell I have less of an appetite and more energy. I am on 1 x 50 mg a day. If you have had bad luck with side effects and antidepressants, you need to try this. I applaud Pristiq."
