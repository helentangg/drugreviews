"I take 225mg a day.  I experience withdrawal symptoms throughout the day.  I have missed a couple doses and felt like I was relapsing.  The medicine helped me.  But the side effects are affecting me physically and have become more and more of a nuisance for me over the last year.  I experience a tingling in my lips and get a nervous feeling throughout the day now.  Jittery and antsy.  I soon will hopefully start the tapering process."
