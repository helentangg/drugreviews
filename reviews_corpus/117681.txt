"I&#039;m 50 and attributed my pain to chronic sinusitis, having had two surgeries and what seemed endless infections.  My ENT doctor recommended seeing a neurologist to determine if migraines were affecting me.  I&#039;d have 8/9 pain 3 to 4 times a month, 4/5 pain often and 2/3 pain almost constantly. I&#039;ve had it so long that I&#039;d routinely work through it, but it&#039;s taken a toll periodically on my personal and professional lives.  I&#039;m currently taking 30mg nightly and am virtually headache free.  It&#039;s great having relief after so long.  Research in the last five years indicates that migraines are often misdiagnosed as sinusitis also if you know someone suffering with what seems be sinus pain, have them get an opinion from a neurologist."
