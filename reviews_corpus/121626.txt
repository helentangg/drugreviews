"While taking this medication it has helped with my Chronic Migraines. I would have migraines 3-4 days a week, after starting Effexor XR, I only have one every week or two. I think over all it worked well for me as a preventative measure. Topamax, Maxalt, Zoloft, and Imitrex. Only the Effexor XR and occasional use of DHE protocol has worked so far for my migraines."
