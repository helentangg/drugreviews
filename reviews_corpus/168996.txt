"Diarrhea only lasted a day. I was pleasantly surprised how fast Viibryd began working. I felt so much better not even five days into taking it, which NEVER happens with me! I thought I had finally found a medication that worked after six years. About two months into taking it I had gained about ten pounds, my vision had gotten worse, my sex drive had gone from being very very high to literally NOTHING (took three months after I stopped taking for it to return), and my depression and anxiety were back in full swing.  It wasn&#039;t normal depression where everything is just boring and you&#039;re lethargic and what not, it was the angry, scary, unpredictable depression I&#039;ve only experienced from bad reactions to other medication in the past."
