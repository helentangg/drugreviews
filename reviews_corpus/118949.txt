"I have been suffering from depression for 22 years. I am 41. Zoloft has helped me tremendously. I was always angry, tired, frustrated and had a hard time getting out of bed. With Zoloft I&#039;m more sociable, friendlier and appreciative of the things that seemed insignificant. Every story is different, try it for yourself."
