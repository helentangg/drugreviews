"Zoloft is a life saver, I was depressed and suicidal since the sixth grade, and in 10th grade had a suicide attempt that ended me up in a hospital. About 2 months on Prozac,  which is horrible (for me), I was put on Zoloft 50mg and have recently been brought up to 200mg for depression and 1mg twice daily Xanax for anxiety and panic disorder. I was 16 when I started taking Zoloft and am 20 now, I still have some depression and anxiety but it is at a much lower level than before, and can actually talk to people and no longer feel like I am a complete failure and a nobody; I feel like I have a purpose to life!"
