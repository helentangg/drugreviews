"I have been taking Zoloft 100mg for over a month now for my anxiety disorders and panic attacks that have gotten in the way of my peace  and my family welfare.  The results have been positive, I feel less stressful, less jittery and do not snap at my family for anything.  Also, it makes me feel more positive towards life and people.  At first it gave me mild diarrhea for two days, and yes, my sexual appetite has dwindle a bit.  I fully recommend it, it is worth trying some medication rather than living with emotional distress a whole life."
