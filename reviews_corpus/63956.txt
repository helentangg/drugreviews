"I was in the darkest place I had ever been before taking Zoloft. I was on Prozac prior, and I would have 3 to 4 panic attacks a day. I would go to to class and need to excuse myself so I could scream and cry about how I would lose everything if I failed out of university, my family, my fraternity brothers, my reputation etc. I am so grateful my GP prescribed this to me. The first few days, all I wanted to do was sleep. I took about 1 week to get any sort of reaction. I was finally able to focus on school and relax/ play video games. I haven&#039;t had a single panic attack since starting this medication, and I couldn&#039;t be happier! My friends and family all noticed the difference too!"
