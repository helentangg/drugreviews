"I suffered from depression caused by many different things. Before this medicine, I had hit the point where I was horrible.  My marriage was about to end, it was so bad.  The first day, I took one as soon as I picked it up. Within a few hours I was happier.  I had more patience and that horrible ball of tension across my shoulders was gone for the first time in months.  I was nauseated, and dizzy.  I am now on day three, I notice I am handling stressful things better, and am in general happier.  The dizziness has abated, diarrhea, and nausea are still there, and I am sweating way more.  That is worth it though, to save my marriage, and feel this happy again."
