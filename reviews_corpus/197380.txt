"I started paroxetine 20 mg 2 1/2 months ago. First few days I was very nauseous. That went away fast and 2 weeks into it I felt good. I could deal with my small anxieties and stresses. I still can deal with them because I don&#039;t care, in fact I came to find I don&#039;t care about anything anymore. About 2 months into this medicine I started sleeping 12 to 14 hours not good, along with very vivid strange dreams and I don&#039;t care - about anything! My ears ring with a buzz and I was gritting my teeth until a piece of my molar broke off. I was not depressed when I started, but I think that&#039;s where I&#039;m headed. I have recently had suicide thoughts. Last 2 weeks taking only 10 mg (split pills) to taper off, after reading all about the withdrawal."
