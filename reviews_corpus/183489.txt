"I&#039;ve been on many SSRI&#039;s years earlier and didn&#039;t want the weight gain again so I got on Cymbalta. I was very dizzy, sick to my stomach and really really tired. I spent almost 3 weeks in bed. I suffer from low cortisol which causes fatigue and after reading about Cymbalta it lowers your cortisol levels by 40%, so I&#039;m back on Paxil which raises your Cortisol levels."
