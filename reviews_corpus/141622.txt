"Side effects for the first five weeks were unpleasant for me. I would get extremely tired and irritable and it upset my stomach.  Then I started to feel great after about 8 weeks at 20mg and I was always extremely happy. Then at around 10 weeks I leveled off and just felt normal. My moods were blah and still are. But I must say I have come a long way and it is working. Would like to come off of it just to remind myself that I need to be on it."
