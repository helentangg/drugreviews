"I took the generic sertraline for the first time tonight, just 50mg and within 2 hours I was throwing up, having dry mouth, diarrhea and shaking uncontrollably. I&#039;m assuming I had an allergic reaction of some sort, I mean, why would 50mgs of Zoloft act so swiftly as far as side effects? Make sure you know your parent&#039;s or other close families experiences with medicines before you take them. It&#039;s a good indicator of what could happen to you, and at least you&#039;ll be prepared. My mom had the same bad reaction but apparently my doctor didn&#039;t find it noteworthy. I suppose now she will. So be careful. Make sure you weigh all your options appropriately."
