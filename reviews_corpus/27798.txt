"I developed severe panic attacks. I felt like I was dying or going to pass out. Something was seriously wrong with me.  Logically I knew nothing was going to happen but then the panic came anyone I left the house. Shaking, sweating, disorentation, couldn&#039;t breathe etc etc. Starting lexapro was hard. I started at small dose of 5mg and had to adjust to it. Nothing more than I already felt. After about 2 weeks I started to not notice I was taking anything.  And then all the sudden I was at a store and I forgot to panic,  I felt fine.  I do have panic attacks still they are not gone but better.  There are situations I still can&#039;t handle but daily living,  going to work, school function,  dinner etc I can now do."
