"Been taking nortriptyline 75mg for two years.  Went from 2-3 headaches a week to maybe 2 a month. Side effects are loss of balance (yoga practice suffers), urine retention, sleepiness.  I take it at night so I sleep pretty well. I&#039;m reading here that some experience weight gain, that&#039;s good to know!  I was blaming myself for lack of self control. This week had what I think was an afibrillation episode in the middle of the night, I have to now look at whether it&#039;s worth it to have heart issues to keep myself from head pain.  The head pain was pretty awful though."
