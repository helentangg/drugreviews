"I&#039;ve been on 10 mg of Citalopram for 6 months. Honestly, I&#039;ve always been skeptical regarding anti-depressants (SSRIs), but once I quit being stubborn and finally started on this medication...just, thank goodness. Citalopram has essentially saved my life. I feel like the me I SHOULD be; as in, this drug didn&#039;t turn me emotionless/zombielike; it simply enhanced me and has brought me back to life. I&#039;m happier, more confident, and so thankful that I&#039;ve gotten myself out of an abyss of chronic sadness. I have experienced a few side effects such as SUPER vivid dreams and more difficulty self-lubricating before sex, but in the scope of things it&#039;s totally manageable. Also, I did NOT gain weight, so don&#039;t let that possibility scare you off!!"
