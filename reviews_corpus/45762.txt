"Originally my doctor prescribed me Klonopin (anti-anxiety medicine) and I took it for a year and started to feel very slow. I had a very blunt expression on my face and my family started to begin to think I was depressed. I saw another doctor and he prescribed me Prozac. It has relieved much of my depression and anxiety. I smile more and I think a bit clearer now. I don&#039;t worry all the time and I actually feel worth something. The first 3-4 weeks you don&#039;t see much improvement but once you hit 2 months you start to feel a lot better (at least I did). However, there are some sexual side effects, and you can feel drowsy. "
