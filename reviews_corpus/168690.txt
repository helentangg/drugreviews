"Started this in May 2015 and side effects were life threatening. F, 5&#039;6&quot; and 117lbs. I take 75 mg adderall a day. I started to have severe anxiety attacks and the doctor gave me 2 packs of viibryd samples from the medicine room and put me on this devil drug. Background I have Addison&#039;s Disease which is pretty much just your body becoming drama queen and fight or fight responses are skewed and amplified. Normal BP WAS 80/40; 2 weeks in pulse was 150  BP 200/150. Diarrhea all day all night!!I developed Serotonin Dyndrome from my regular meds and this. I was in cardiac arrest and almost didn&#039;t come out. BP STILL HIGH normal is 145/100 now and it&#039;s caused so much more with anxiety so it sucks"
