"I have been depressed and have anxiety for years since i was 6. im 55 now. No one new anything back then why I was a nut case out of control thoughts actions major moods swings and instant anger. no remorse no empathy nothing just hate and pure panic.
I have tried all kinds of different meds for the last 15 years and some were OK but nothing like these. My god I do 60mg twice a day. no side effects, no anger, no mood swings, no depression or anything, its all gone everything. you have no idea the great feeling it is to think normal act normal be polite and thoughtful, caring understanding, just incredible difference. I was taken off them for 5 weeks to try something else to see if it was me or the meds. back to the old me instantly. lifer.."
