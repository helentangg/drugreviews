"Prior to starting this medication I couldn&#039;t drive in the car by myself anymore, I could barely go into the convenient store by myself without having a panic attack. After searching for a doctor that could help me  I landed the best psychiatrist who prescribed me Effexor.  I started with a low dose and was also taken Ativan as a crutch to get through until the Effexor worked.   Before starting this I swore that I would never regain control of my life. Effexor change my life and saved me from the helplessness that I felt.  I am now off the Ativan  and have not needed any sense stopping it.   There is freedom beyond panic and anxiety.  This may not work for everybody but it worked for me."
