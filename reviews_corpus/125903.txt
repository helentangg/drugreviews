"I&#039;m 16 years old and I hav been on several anxiety/depression medications including prozac, zoloft, lexapro, propranolol, klonpin,etc I take 40mg once a day and this is the first medication that actually works for me. All of the other ones made me suicidal or more depressed. I can defintely tell when I miss a dose of viibryd I get sad and very emotional. I&#039;ve been taking viibryd for about 8 months. I have gained 15 pounds but I don&#039;t know if that is because of the medicine or not. It really bothers me though. i have less of an appetite and sleep way too much, sometimes 4 naps a day. I fall asleep during school I&#039;m super emotional I easily get annoyed, sad, angry. I cry alot . I have no idea if any of these are side effects of the meds or not"
