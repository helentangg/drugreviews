"Have MDNOS/possibly Bipolar. Went on Lamictal about 5 years ago which saved my life (awful, terrible mood swings). Was still fairly down so added Celexa after 1 year. This helped but after 2 years it lost efficacy. Switched to Lexapro 18 months ago to combat that and it worked for a while. But the side effects have gotten worse. After  6 months taking it my libido started decreasing and now it is literally gone. I get &quot;high&quot; when I take it then crash and feel like a zombie until I take it again. I have no motivation at work, can&#039;t stay focused, restless, can&#039;t just sit and be content, no emotion. Unless I&#039;m depressed or pissed. It&#039;s not worth it. My new doctor is weaning me off it, thank god, here&#039;s hoping I come out okay on the other side."
