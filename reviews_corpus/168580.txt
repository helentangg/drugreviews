"I had tried everything.  Other drugs affected my sex life, made me gain weight, made me slow.  Viibryd has been a life saver.  The only thing that bothers me is that there won&#039;t be a generic for 3-5 years and without an HMO or Healthcare plan it is about $270 a month.

Viibryd has some &quot;first year&quot; discounts"
