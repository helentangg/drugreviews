"Celexa is very effective in my opinion. I have tried Lexapro and Paxil which made me horribly sick. I have had a few side effects since I am just starting it, but they are not that bad. I can tell they are there but I&#039;m not stopped by them. The only effect I don&#039;t like is the sexual problems. They aren&#039;t kidding about it. Started affecting me on day 1. Getting better is worth it though. Please give it a try, even if you&#039;re nervous!"
