"I have been taking Lexapro for 5 months now and it has really worked for me.  I am a 30 year old working mother of two and got very depressed due to alot of factors which included balancing work and family and trying hard to make ends meet.  I cried alot and suffered terribly from tension headaches.  Since starting Lexapro I have been much better with the kids and better able to cope with what life throws at me.  The only side effects I have noticed is a little weight gain and lack of sex drive (which doesn&#039;t make my husband too happy) but he will get over it."
