"My doctor recently prescribed Pristiq for me when I went to see him for help with my mood swings. After a rather nasty incident at a family dinner, I decided that I needed help. My family has put up with these swings for years, and sometimes I cry when alone.  I did not realize that I was suffering long term depression.  I am only on day four of taking this medication, and already I can feel a difference. I don&#039;t feel as moody or down in the dumps.  I hope this effect continues, as my past self was breaking my family up. I do agree with other posts here that it decreases your appetite.  I do not feel like eating at all.  As for sleeping goes, I have always had a problem in this area due to being a shift worker. I take sleeping tablets."
