"First time taking medication for depression, and so far it has helped. Had some minor symptoms such as diarrhea in the first few weeks, with an occasional restless night but other than that it is fantastic. One word of caution though is seriously don&#039;t drink too much while on Viibryd. I went out for a friends 21st and I was the one who ended up in the hospital after only a few drinks. For depression though, this medicine works miracles!"
