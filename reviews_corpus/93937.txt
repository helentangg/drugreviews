"Life changing experience. I have been on many different medications on and off over the years, and trintellix is honestly the only thing that worked for me. Pros: 
I was able to eat again! My depression and anxiety had caused me to lose over 30 pounds in just a few months, and I looked sickly. After 2 weeks on trintellix, I got my appetite back. 
My anxiety reduced, but didn&#039;t fully subside. I had Xanax for emergencies when trintellix couldn&#039;t control my anxiety. 
I was still able to feel emotions, and never had sexual dysfunction.
It helped me get my sleeping back on track, and I was able to establish a normal sleep schedule.
Cons: 
Cost, thank goodness my doctor had a lot of samples becaue I could not afford the monthly cost every month."
