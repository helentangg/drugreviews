"I tried taking Pristiq for 6 days.  The side effects were so bad I could not function.  I could not work, eat, or sleep and felt nauseous. My vision was blurry. My mouth was so dry and my appetite was non existent.  I only weigh 111 lbs and I do not need to miss a meal.  I have stopped taking this medication.  I was taking 50mg and this is the first medicine I have ever taken for depression. "
