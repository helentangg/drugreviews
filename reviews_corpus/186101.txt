"Pristiq has worked great for me for anxiety and depression two separate times throughout my life when I was put on other ADs and they didn&#039;t work as they should, including Prozac and Cymbalta. Takes awhile to get stable in your system but after about 6 months I was back to myself. Definitely recommend, the only con for me is that if you miss a pill you can definitely tell.  I get wierd dreams if I miss a pill and feel grogy and irritable. When I had been on prozac missing a pill was never noticeable. Also,  it is more expensive as there is no generic. It is worth it to me however to have something that fully works! Good luck to you!"
