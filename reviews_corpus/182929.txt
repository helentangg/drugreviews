"Worked for me at a time I had slipped into suicidal ideations. I have a rheumatological disorder that has no cure, &amp; the treatment is dangerous (steroids most of the time); I have severe anxiety; do not know from a day to the following how I will feel or if I will accomplish small tasks, forget about holding a job. This helped anxiety, suicide thoughts, the horrible feelings of major depression, fear, &amp; pain. It is important to read about the medications you should not take with this. Start slowly &amp; have patience. Appears that more medications tried, the easier this is to get acclimated to."
