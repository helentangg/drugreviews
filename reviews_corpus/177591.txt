"I have been on Cymbalta for my Fibromyalgia since Nov.2014.
I had loved this med,helped some what with my pain and also helped my moods. (I called it my happy pill..lol)
I have been experiencing many months of restless sleep and extreme sweating! I never considered it was my wonder drug.
But it is,it has to be..Cymbalta is the only drug I take and the only change for me in a year. Also I have gained an excessive amount of weight ! I can not handle this extreme sweating,also very fatigued. 
I am starting today to ween off of it..my doc started me on Lyrcia.
I sure hope this helps!
So tired of being tired and in pain.."
