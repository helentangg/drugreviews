"I have dealt with depression stemming from an incident in my profession.  I was initially on Zoloft for about 1-2 years.  It worked OK but after a while not so much and all I got from it was that zombified &quot;what&#039;s the point of life anyway&quot; feeling.  I switched to Pristiq and it was much better.  It cuts the depression but doesn&#039;t give you that blahed out zombie feeling that the SSRIs can do.  I don&#039;t have much of the side-effects luckily.  I have noticed it takes longer to ejaculate (but I think my wife sort of likes that part of it- sorry for too much info). Anyway Pristiq is a great medicine.  I noticed some people here had bad experiences with it.  I think that&#039;s to be expected with all antidepressants. Keep trying and find the right one."
