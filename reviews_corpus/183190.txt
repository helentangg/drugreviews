"I am 58 yo active woman with full time career. I began to obsess about my father&#039;s death. Every thing I saw reminded me of him and was painful. I cried over mishaps at home or thinking about a beloved pet that had died. Work was my relief but as soon as I got home the sadness started. My MD started me on Lexapro, which wasn&#039;t good for me. I suffered through work for a day but was too spacey. My job requires strong concentration skills. Prozac next which made me yawn like a lion. By week 3 I did not feel sad, but felt sick and had yawns like a lion. I then started Cymbalta and felt this was the most gentle antidepressant so far but then my EYES became swollen and DRY. I couldn&#039;t wear contacts! I gave up on antidepressants and started exercising. "
