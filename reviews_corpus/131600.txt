"At first I read all the reviews positive and negative and was like oh hell no!!! I would leave work early, wouldn&#039;t wan to leave the house or even go to the store. So  my DR started me on 37.5 mg XR a few months ago. Only side effect was felt sick to my stomach but that went away after a while. I know people are different but WOW has it changed my life and thinking. I felt like an old me again, not worrying like a nervous nelly about things not in my head thinking about the what ifs, was staying at work and going to stores and people around me noticed the change in me. I was more up beat and less nervous. Now today I started the 75mg XR because my DR said let make you feel even more better. Hopefully this works if not I&#039;ll just go back down to 37.5mg"
