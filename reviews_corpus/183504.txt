"I am 15, about to turn 16 and I have been taking Cymbalta for a few months now. At first this medicine helped me out to sort out a few issues in life but now it seems to me and my friends and family can see that I have gone back to the way I was before I started taking Cymbalta. This is the second medication I have been on for major depression. I can&#039;t sleep properly anymore and in my waking hours I feel so deep in a hole. I also have severe anger snaps that turn out very bad for those around and myself. Its 6 days to Christmas, not excited a bit and only a month till my birthday and still not excited. Cymbalta as I said was very helpful at first but it seems my body has got used to this and now I am on a very big down spiral."
