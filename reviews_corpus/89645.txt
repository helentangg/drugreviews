"I just started Celexa when my doctor put me on it about a week ago. We just couldn&#039;t win with my depression and all that entails for major depressive disorder, and I was feeling really depressed at the time. I&#039;m on a low dose but only for about two weeks until we check it out. I&#039;ve been diagnosed now for about 8 or 9 years, tried LOTS of anti-depressants. Even though I tried to work with them all, as a team me and the medicine, we just couldn&#039;t win with it the depression. My side effects of depression are a huge lack of energy, being angry often, usually at the whole world, so much stress and negativity, So much that I will say thanks to everyone who commented. I hope I have a lot to look forward to now based on all of the positive comments about Celexa."
