"I&#039;ve been taking Citalopram for about a year now for  my depression and anxiety and it has really helped out a lot. I&#039;m taking 20 mg a day and my depression has completely disappeared. It worked good for my anxiety for awhile, but my anxiety has came back a little. When I first started taking it,  I took it at night and it gave me MAJOR  restless leg syndrome, so I take it in morning and it&#039;s better. Just some days it makes me yawn all day and sometimes space out during the day.  But I&#039;m very happy It has taken away my depression."
