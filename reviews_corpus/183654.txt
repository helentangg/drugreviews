"I have Rheumatoid arthritis, Fibromyalgia and restless legs syndrome. I was taking Cymbalta for the FMS symptoms. I started taking Cymbalta about 1.5 months ago and yesterday was moved to Savella.  I give Cymbalta great credit. It does what it says. Within days of starting it, my pain level went from a constant 6-8 lingering to 0-1.  I hadn&#039;t felt so good in years.  My mood improved greatly too. BUT, I had to transition off of it due to side effects including headaches that would come on at the drop of a pin feeling like an axe in my head and throbbing with every beat of my heart. When I&#039;d take my Blood pressure it would be up to 140/85 from a usual 116/64, profuse sweating to the point of having to change clothes, night sweats and anorgasmia.  The doctor reacted to the Blood Pressure elevation with concern."
