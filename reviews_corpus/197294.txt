"On 2 months of 20mg per day.  The first 5 weeks were not bad with side effects at all.  I noticed a slight mood elevation but nothing more.  In week 6 I hit some side effects like insomnia and had 6 hours of bad sleep over 5 days.  Completely miserable time.  Seemed like once that passed, I got the benefits significantly."
