"Prozac is an amazing medicine. I was severely depressed and saw no light at the end of the tunnel. My anxieties and depression were slowly killing me. I couldn&#039;t eat, sleep, or be still with myself. My doctor prescribed Prozac. First 20mg then 40mg. It took about 30 days before I noticed a big change in mood. My situation never changed, but the way I looked at it did and I felt hope and got a warm feeling. The side effects are manageable. My libido has decreased slightly, but I am still able to achieve orgasm. I have not had any weight gain.  I&#039;ve been on Prozac for about 8 months now. It&#039;s been a life saver for me. I just started CBT counseling with a psychologist so I can learn to think and react differently to/about some things."
