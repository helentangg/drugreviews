"I&#039;ve been dealing with depression for a few years recently it had gotten so bad that suicidal thoughts and social withdrawal were really concerning me.  I tried to fight it naturally by taking Super B Complex but to no avail.  Within the last month and a half I&#039;ve tried Lexapro which did not work for me and now Pristiq which I must say is really helping me.  I&#039;m finally having sex again with my husband.  I didn&#039;t know that it was depression that was hindering me and having an orgasm is not a problem at all.  In fact I&#039;ve become quite frisky.  A lot more talkative and beginning to get together with friends again without as much anxiety.  Anxiety is not completely gone yet but it&#039;s only been two weeks.  Loving it!"
