"Started effexor 75 in Oct start feeling fantastic beside dry mouth and a bit of nausea. Doctor up it to 150mg in November. I felt like a whole different person I got my life back but due to some side effects of the drug causing constipation and facial twitching in my lower lip and body jolts doctor tried to ween me off 150 mg taking one pill every second day it was too fast to soon. Wow just as well if I had done it cold turkey. Brain zaps, crying, feeling lost in my own body. Scared tremors.  It has been almost 2 weeks with no effexor and I have got vertigo, felt like I was going to die.  Today I started taking 150mg again today and already feel a difference. This could be my drug huge difference in mood ,zapping  gone and dry mouth is back I can live with that ."
