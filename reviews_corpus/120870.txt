"Every day I take this drug, I feel better and better.  So calm, my ADD is in check and I sleep through the night. I have been on zoloft, celexa, vyvance  and wellbutrin.  Nothing other than benzos have taken away my generalized anxiety and made me feel calm and happy  No menopause symptoms either.  The only thing that scares me now is I hear how hard it is to come off of.  At this point I don&#039;t want to come off of it.  But I have come off zoloft, vyvance and wellbutrin. Why would it be so much harder to come off than those medications.   I don&#039;t suffer from depression just debilitating anxiety and it has literally improved my quality of life 100percent. All&#039;s I hear are horror stories and  I don&#039;t get it. Love to hear from other good experiences"
