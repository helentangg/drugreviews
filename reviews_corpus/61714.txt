"I&#039;ve been on Celexa (actually Citalopram - the generic equivalent) for several years for anxiety attacks.  It made a huge difference at first.  I started having issues with excessive fatigue, foggy brain, and sore joints.  Out of desperation, I tried an elimination diet going gluten free.  After about 6 weeks of being totally gluten free the fatigue, mind fog and joint pain subsided and I started getting the same side effects as I had when first getting on the Citalopram.  I cut my script from 40 mg to 20 mg and was feeling much better.  Over a year later, I&#039;m still feeling much better.  I&#039;m trying to ween myself off the citalopram - dropping to 10 mg was fine, but now, almost two weeks into no pills at all, I&#039;m beginning to feel anxiety."
