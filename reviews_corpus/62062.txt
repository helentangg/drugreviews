"Difficulty urinating and low sex drive side effects took about 2 months to subside, felt really tired for about 4 to 6 months just going to work to pay the bills and sleeping the rest of the time. But now its a lot better, I deal with anxiety better but the combination of physiologist and medicines work better.
I&#039;m not the full on person I was and I take things slowly now. Now I just stop and smell the daises a bit but I took this for me to learn that the happy things in life are sometimes the simplest."
