"Never normally share but I started taking Sertraline after feeling very depressed, emotional and even some thoughts of suicide. I made an appointment with my doctor and he put me on 50mg, after taking this for two months there was talks of putting it up to 100mg. I couldn&#039;t think of anything worse. The first few days of taking 50mg I felt a little better, as the weeks went on I just went down hill and was in a dark spiral, my anxiety became worse than it has ever been, I barely left the house, I couldn&#039;t cope no longer and I lost hope. I eventually realised the tablets were making me feeling a lot worse so have stopped taking them... I am starting to feel a little better already"
