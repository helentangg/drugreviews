"Took this for IBS-C for about 2 months, 10 mg. Worked great for pain, even a bit for my anxiety. Unfortunately, gave me hard stools which was already a problem. Took more miralax and it helped with that. Still made me drowsy after a month. I suggest taking in the early in the evening so you don&#039;t feel groggy in the morning."
