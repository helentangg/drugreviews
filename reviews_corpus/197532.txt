"It worked for me, It worked for me, It worked for me....oops...must have missed this mornings dose (LOL). I have suffered from GAD/OCD for a few years. Most of the time I was worried and anxious and suffered panic attacks and general high-stress feelings before taking Paxil. I take 10mg&#039;s of Paxil once per day for about 6 months now. I am starting to see my previous behaviors that only prolonged and worsened my anxiety disorder. I am able to relax, calm down, sit back and actually make myself relax, even during high stress times. I hope to not be on Paxil for very many years, but it did help me, help myself out of OCD/panic hell. Counselling was just as important as Paxil, and re-learning how to make yourself chill. Paxil Helps!"
