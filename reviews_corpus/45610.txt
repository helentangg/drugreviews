"I suffer from depression which has worsened with the onset of menopause. I have a son with ADHD and a husband with HF Autism so my life can be very stressful.  Fluoxetine has calmed me down and helped me to see positives in my lifestyle.  Drawbacks include dry mouth and initially I put 2 stone on which I have now managed to lose.  I fluctuate between 20mg and 40mg depending on how testing things get. I have come off it several times and also reduced to one 20mg every other day but increased again now. I hope to be able to come off it at some point. "
