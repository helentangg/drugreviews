"I&#039;d been taking Prozac for a few years, but its effects wore off, so I switched to this. I&#039;m very glad I did. It completely got rid of my panic attacks and obsessive worries, and reminded me how good life can be without them. I still feel sluggish, but I always have, even before I started SSRIs. The most noticeable side effects have been weight gain and erectile dysfunction. I&#039;m going to try nefazadone and see if that works for me without the side effects. But if you don&#039;t have these side effects or they&#039;re not a big deal, I highly recommend Zoloft."
