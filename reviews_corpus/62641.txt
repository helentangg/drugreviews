"Last summer I was severely stressed in my job in addition I probably had a sort of post traumatic stress going on as a result of cancer treatment. I had terrible insomnia and probably a mild case of depression. My doctor put me on 20mg Celexa (or the generic) and in about 3 weeks I was much better. Few side effects... some memory issues, slight fatigue but that my be related to my hormone
treatment. 

I&#039;d like to stop taking it sometime in the future but I don&#039;t want to feel like I did before. How does one make the transition?"
