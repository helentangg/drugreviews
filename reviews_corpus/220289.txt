"I have had migraines since I was a child. Tired of living in pain and having many imobilizing days, at 24 years old I finally sought treatment. I have been taking Amitriptyline for a year, starting at 15mg once every night before bed which did not seem to manage them very well, then increasing to 75mgs before bed. It has worked wonders in managing my migraines. I went from 4 migraines a week to now once a week. I will be returning to Dr. to figure out the next step since I have been a year in overall peace but still have the constant one a week. Only side effect I have noticed is slight weight gain but nothing serious. Amitriptyline has been an enormous aid in my migraine prevention and I am extremely glad to have given it a chance."
