"I have been taking 50mg of Zoloft (generic) for almost a week now and have noticed increased fatigue and little to no difference in my mood. I am constantly tired and indifferent to everything, though I do realize it takes time for the medicines to kick in.  I was on Paxil for a month beforehand and felt no effect.  Hopefully Zoloft will do the trick. "
