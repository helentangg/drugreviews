"I had underlying anxiety - constantly wanting to hide in bed - random crying - high intensity job - mind wouldn&#039;t shut off. Told doctor - she said this had helped many clients - by my 2nd day on 1/4 of the largest pill size -  I felt at ease and pretty carefree. My life is 75% easier to take and I&#039;m able to get through life with a smile. Very happy. "
