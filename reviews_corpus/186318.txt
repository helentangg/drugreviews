"This is my third round of starting Pristiq (02/12). First was in 2008. In 2008, I literally had NO anxiety or depression after four weeks and thought Pritiq was incredible (first and only experience with an antidepressant)! I started sleeping better immediately. Discontinued cold turkey after a few months thinking I was &quot;cured&quot; of anxiety...NEVER EVER do that!!! Round two was during summer 2010. The anxiety and depression returned with a vengeance. Started Pristiq again and began to feel the positive effects after two weeks. I gradually discontinued the medicine around January 2011 because my stress (likely diet and job) was out of control. No side effects here and no plans to discontinue. My wife takes it for panic disorder-works like a charm!"
