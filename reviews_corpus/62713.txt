"I started taking Celexa for post-partum depression about 2 years ago. Started at 20mg and have been on 40mg for over a year now. I&#039;m not sure if its related, but the past 6 months or so, I have had increasing muscle/joint pain, with fatigue and insomnia. I&#039;ve been absolutely miserable. I will say that for the depression and mood swings Celexa is great, provided you don&#039;t get the UNcommon side effects."
