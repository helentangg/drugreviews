"My anxiety hit a high in my mid 20s &amp; went from every once in a while to a constant drowning feeling of anxiety. When it became paralyzing, I started therapy. After 3 months of therapy &amp; being against medication, I started to learn more about the illness, how it runs in my family &amp; because the physical symptoms weren&#039;t going away I started Lexapro. For the 1st couple of months as I increased the mg, I became paranoid that I was going to become suicidal. I had never thought about this in my life, never depressed &amp; was actually very happy with my life. I was just so paranoid that I would lose control of my anxiety and hurt myself. It went away and I feel better than ever. I see life differently, more grateful for every day "
