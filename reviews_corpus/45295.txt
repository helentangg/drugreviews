"In about 1996 I started Prozac for 13 years and then it stopped working,  I was on 2 different meds since then but the last one caused excessive body sweating to the point where I could not work as I work with the public.
I just went back on Prozac 3 days ago and I already feel so calm and rational.  When I was on it for those 13 years my doctor said I was the poster child for Prozac as I had no symptoms.  So far I do not have any.
I love Prozac."
