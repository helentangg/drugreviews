"I was very tired the first week, but after pushing through it I felt better.  Headaches took about 2-3 weeks to go away, but they were gone.  I had been having headaches almost daily and they were getting severe.  I felt pain free, HOWEVER, I felt like my IQ had dropped about 20 points.  I couldnt think of things quickly anymore and it was getting worse.  My typing was getting worse and I was forgetting everyday things like family members names.  I pulled backwards out of my driveway one day and with myself turned around looking out the rear window, I couldnt orient myself to figure out which side of the road to be on.  I was on Elavil for almost 2 months.  I took myself off 1 week ago.  Headaches are coming back, but my memory is returning"
