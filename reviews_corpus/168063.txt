"Only been on it about 6 weeks and only up to 30mg. Moods are a little better so far but insomnia hello. I&#039;m lucky to get 3 or 4 hours a nite I don&#039;t get how all of you sleep. I used to fall right asleep with my topamax at nite. Now he has me taking my gabapentin, topamax and imipramine at bedtime optional Ativan too but then I wake up groggy defeating the purpose of great mood in the am. 
Hum maybe my meds don&#039;t play nice together at nite lol. I do get the dry mouth I really hate that but it has improved my morning moods which is what we were going for. I do have anxiety and it doesn&#039;t help with a quick onset. I am hopeful for this med as I have tried just about everything out there!"
