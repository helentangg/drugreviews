"I have been  suffering from GAD for several years now, with highs and lows. I first had Prozac which worked really well until this year, it made me nervous, I was being aggressive with my relatives and fed up about everything, probably because of health issues + my mother being ill + my son being video games addicted, that was too much, my anxiety was constant with some panic feelings sometimes. 

Sleepless nights is my main problem, I would wake up at 2 or 4 am and unable to get back to sleep. I tried Valdoxan but it did noting to med. So my doctor tried Citalopram. 

I started 10 mg per day almost 4 weeks ago and the fist 3 weeks were just HELL but finally it started to be effective and I am quite happy about it. 10 mg is enough for me."
