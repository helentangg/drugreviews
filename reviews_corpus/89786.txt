"This was the first drug I was put on. Starting at 20mg and over time increasing it to the maximum dose of 60mg. It&#039;s not very strong or effective. However, it does help and the side effects are virtually non existent.

These days I use it as a fall back medicine - if I want to come off the one I am on (due to side effects etc). I&#039;ll begin back on the citalopram to keep me ticking until I get another antidepressant to try."
