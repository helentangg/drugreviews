"I have been on escitalopram for 9 months now. I have a 10 year diagnosed history of depression and anxiety and 4 year diagnosed BPD. This drug has helped immensely.

Originally prescribed at 5mg for help with my perpetual anxiety attacks I found almost instant relief (within 4 days of beginning the medication) after 4 months my doctor increased it as I had had no noticeable side effects in hopes to help combat my depression.... 9 months later there is no more cutting or suicidal thoughts, higher productivity, fewer down days and more enthusiasm for life. I&#039;m on a daily dose of 20mg (strictly taken at night as I find taking it in the morning gives my brain doesn&#039;t work properly when I am trying to pay attention at uni or work)."
