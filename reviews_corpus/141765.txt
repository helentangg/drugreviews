"I&#039;m a college student, but ever since high school I&#039;ve been suffering from depression and anxiety. Once I started taking Lexapro my senior year of high school it immediately helped with the depression immensely. I was less irritable and not so emotional all the time but as for the anxiety, it only helped very little. Right now, my anxiety is through the roof and I find myself stressing over every little thing. A lot of the times on the verge of tears. So for depression, Lexapro&#039;s an 8, but for anxiety I can only rank it about a 4."
