"This started out as a great experience. I was on Lexapro but due to the decreased sexual desire wanted to try something else.
The first three months felt great, no improvement on the sexual aspect however.  Then the side effects started and it was terrible. Started with constipation, which I was able to put up with. The legs hurting and cramping was another story. As long as I was active I had no problem. Go on a trip and it was hell. My legs would hurt like crazy. Then at night in bed if I turned over I got leg cramps in my thighs.

OH and the DREAMS! So real, vivid and weird.

Expensive!"
