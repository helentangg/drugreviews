"I started taken Prozac 20mg a day for nearly 6 years! I stopped taking them 7 months ago as I thought I didn&#039;t need them anymore, since I&#039;ve stopped taking them I&#039;ve become really agrophobic, really depressed, can&#039;t stop crying, I&#039;ve just shut my self away. I&#039;m thinking off starting Prozac again."
