"I was prescribed  20mg citalopram for anxiety and depression. It helped out immensely for keeping me calm, never stressed, and it helped me sleep well at night. However, it killed my libido and has made me emotionless. It didn&#039;t help my social anxiety very much. I can go out and not be a nervous wreck, but I can&#039;t enjoy myself. I feel like a walking zombie for most of the day, but my appetite is normal. What bothered me the most is, I can&#039;t hold a conversation with the people I love the most. I didn&#039;t have the enthusiasm to talk to my husband like I used to. I&#039;ve been on this drug for 2 weeks. It killed my libido on my second day of taking it. I&#039;m going to taper down to 10mg and see how I feel."
