"I was started at a low 75 mg. This was a very dark time emotionally for me because I felt like I was taking candy, not medicine. 

As we slowly increased the dose,  the heaviness of depression began to lift, but I also became VERY sleepy. 

Other early side effects was dizziness, insomnia, minor stupor, vivid dreams, stomach cramps, and worsened anxiety. All these are gone except anxiety.

We added a sleep aid and Buspar to take as needed for anxiety and insomnia. But I had to up the venlafaxine XR to my doctors max outpatient dose of 225 mg to get rid of the unmanageable depression. This dose combined with CBT (therapy) has greatly increased the quality of my life. But NEVER FORGET A PILL! Withdrawal is awful! Sobbing, &quot;shocks&quot;, lethargy."
