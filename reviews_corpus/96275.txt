"I&#039;ve been taking zoloft for a few years for ocd, starting with 20 milligrams per day and increasing to 40. It has helped me greatly with my obsessions, but not my compulsions. Of the two, I have always thought the obsessions were worse, so I think it has been a successful medicine for me. And so far, I have experienced no side effects. I also take zocor for cholesterol and have had no negative interaction."
