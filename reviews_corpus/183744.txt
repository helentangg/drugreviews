"I share the same experiences as other reviewers. Fibromyalgia was finally diagnosed 10 years ago. I started taking Cymbalta one year ago and it has been a life changing event. It allowed me to get off the two opiate pain medications I was on. No need to tell anyone the impact it has on my life. It&#039;s a priceless medicine."
