"The first couple of weeks of Pristiq were rough. The usual side effects, nausea, dry mouth, drowsiness. In the second week a lot of rage erupted, and I had another post traumatic stress disorder flashback. But I persisted throughout all of this, and the rewards are finally here. It&#039;s now the end of the third week, and I am feeling energetic, focused and optimistic. Creative ideas seem to flow easier, and I am out there in the world again, taking photos and hiking. This antidepressant is certainly working a lot better than Prozac did, and better than I remember Effexor being. Worth a shot."
