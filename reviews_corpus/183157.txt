"During my  mid 40&#039;s,  I began experiencing excruciating neck pain. I had cervical fusion for a ruptured cervical disk. After the  surgery, I have had extreme chronic fatigue,  bone pain, overall body pain, and paralysis of one vocal cord.  I tried numerous pain medications which had absolutely no effect on my pain. Ultimately, the combination of medications that helped were a low dosage of methadone, Prozac, and Provigil (for narcolepsy). Recently my doctor changed by Prozac to Cymbalta. My  pain is now almost
gone!   (I am still taking methadone, but maybe it will no longer be necessary. (I changed to Nuvigil for extreme daytime sleepiness.) No side effects from Cymbalta except for slight nausea during the first week of use."
