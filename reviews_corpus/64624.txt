"Horrible experience. I was prescribed a low dose of 25mg to start off with for depression but I noticed an immediate negative response from my body in that my mood swings elevated and I was constantly sobbing every night and had constant suicidal thoughts. Other medications I was taking at the time was depo-provera for birth control for about four years prior to taking sertraline for the first time."
