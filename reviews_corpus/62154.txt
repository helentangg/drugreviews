"I have been taking Citalopram for about 2 months now. I was in a horrible state of anxiety, depression and de-personalisation. It had completely taken over my life. This medicine has been a life saver - however it only started to work for me after the first month of taking it. I want to encourage people to persist with it like I did, and hopefully you will experience the same benefits. Good luck to all."
