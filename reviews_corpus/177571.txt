"I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder.  It got so bad I couldn&#039;t function and my Dr took me off work for 5 weeks and gave me 30mg of cymbalta (generic).  By day 10 I noticed a big improvement..about 60% better.  I see Dr in 2 weeks and she will decide if I should take 60mg.  I really don&#039;t want to and I&#039;m hoping I will continue to get better on the 30mg.  I guess I will wait and see how I feel.  I think therapy is a must for people with anxiety so we can learn ways to help stop the negative thoughts and not let them ruminate on a repeat reel in our head.  I have found that there are things we can learn to help with that along with the meds."
