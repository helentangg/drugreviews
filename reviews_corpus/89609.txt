"I have suffered from severe depression and social anxiety for years. After 3 days on Celexa my world felt completely different. Everything feels right again and for the first time in ages I feel happy. The only side effect I have encountered is random bouts of fatigue but I have been told it will balance out after a few weeks. This medicine is incredible and I can&#039;t believe it took me so long to admit I needed it."
