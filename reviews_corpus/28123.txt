"I have been dealing with general and situational anxiety disorder and panic attacks on and off since college.  Tried Paxil and Prozac. Paxil made me gain 20 lbs. and Prozac increased my anxiety.  Lexapro works.

My advice: Try taking Lexapro for at least one week. The first week you will feel tired, dizzy, and mildly nauseated. Those effects disappear very quickly.  Do start at 5mg and slowly increase to 10 or 20mg. Ask you doctor to supplement with Buspar XL which counteracts most Lexapro side effects and further helps control anxiety and panic attacks. I don&#039;t recommend using Lexapro without Buspar.  Anxiety/Panic will gradually disappear over two to four weeks.  Use Ativan or other Benzodiazapines sparingly until Lexapro is working."
