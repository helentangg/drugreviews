"Before I started taking lexapro I had recurring suicidal thoughts constantly. I&#039;ve been taking it for 3 months now and I honestly can&#039;t believe how great the results are. I have zero suicidal thoughts, which is a first. My anxiety has pretty much disappeared completely, which I didn&#039;t even realize that I had some anxiety until the medicine started working. I actually get up and do stuff again! I finally got my life back under control thanks to lexapro. I was afraid to take it at first because I was afraid to gain weight like some people experience, and I actually have gained 5 lbs but it actually looks good on me because I was extremely slender before. I&#039;m on 10 mg btw."
