"After trying Tramadol, Oxycodone and Neurontin, I tried Nortriptyline for chronic back pain due to a herniated disc.  Unfortunately, after only a couple of days on the drug, I had to quit.  It made me extremely dizzy and caused my blood pressure to drop so quickly, that I nearly passed out while taking a vigorous walk.  "
