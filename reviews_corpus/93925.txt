"I have had depression for most of my life and had been taking Zoloft for about 7 years after I had my first child, recently felt it wasn&#039;t working as well anymore so I talked to my doctor and they suggested this.Took it for 6 weeks but had to stop. I know everyone is different, but for me it made my depression worse, I started having mood swings, anger issues, crying over everything, panic attacks, around the 2nd week I developed a cough, No other symptoms. When the cough persisted for about 2 1/2 weeks I went back to doc and they prescribed me antibiotics. Completed those, still had cough, then I had panic attacks 2 days in a row so I stopped taking the trintellix, as soon as I did, the cough was gone. definitely don&#039;t recommend this med"
