"I was prescribed this at a low dose for various sleep problems associated with CFS/ME. Helps tremendously with remaining asleep (used to wake up 4-8 times a night) but basically completely useless aiding someone who has trouble getting to sleep - one of my main problems. Horrific and vivid nightmares frequently occurring since I&#039;ve been taking it &amp; v. dry mouth. Staying on it as GP very reluctant to give me anything stronger for my sleep unfortunately"
