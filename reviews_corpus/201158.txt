"Definitely helps my depression although I still get random bouts of it at times but no improvement whatsoever in my social anxiety. Can&#039;t do any of the things normal people do, talking to people, being in stores, etc. Also every time I increase it triggers me too feel more depressed and suicidal for at least a week then it leaves. It didn&#039;t help the anxiety part for me but I hope it works for someone else."
