"Celexa has definitely helped me get back to my normal self but I&#039;ve only been taking it a week (started with 10mg for a few days and now I&#039;m at 20mg) and it has completely taken away my appetite. I have thrown up every day sometimes multiple times a day but I feel great otherwise. Happiness comes a lot easier so I&#039;ll deal with the excessive vomiting for a while since I need to lose some weight anyway."
