"Have been on Cymbalta for 6 months and no side effects but no help for fibromyalgia BUT wonderful for depression and anxiety (was previously on Prozac for 13 years).  I take 1 x 20mg in the morning.  I recently started using Ultram 100mg SR as well and the combination is unbelievable as I have had fibro for 35 years (only diagnosed 16 years ago).  I have a life, I may be able to clean my house, go out with friends.  I hope this could work for you."
