"I have depression, anxiety, and ADHD. I tried lexapro, prozac, gabapentin, and lamictal for my depression/anxiety, and none helped at all. I was starting to get discouraged, and I was nervous when my psychiatrist suggested on trying Cymbalta, an SNRI, because I&#039;ve heard many horror stories about Cymbalta from brain zaps to emergency room visits. But every medication has it&#039;s horror stories, and I knew that every person has a different experience, so I gave it a try. 
And holy moly, this medication saved my life. I feel finally feel like myself again, and thinking about the difference this med has made is making my eyes tear up. I was in such a dark place for so long, and things FINALLY feel okay now. I&#039;ve been on it for 4 months, 60mg."
