"I&#039;ve taken amitriptyline off and on for 8 years &amp; have had migraines for almost 30 years (I&#039;m 41). 25mg cuts migraines down to 3-4/month (rather than the 5-10 /month I get with no medication), and carb cravings are quite manageable. No weight gain at 25mg, even after several months. When I tried 50mg, I had a hard time controlling carb cravings and gained 10lbs over 2 months; but, I didn&#039;t make much effort to fight carb cravings. I suspect if one exercises moderately and watches carb intake, weight gain can be avoided, even at &quot;higher&quot; doses (25mg+). I&#039;m now taking 40mg. Side-effects from anti-convulsants &amp; beta blockers were intolerable for me- far worse than the dry mouth &amp; carb cravings I get with amitriptyline. A great drug overall."
