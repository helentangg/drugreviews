"I went to my OB GYN to ask about Lexapro for some major depression &amp; anxiety I was experiencing. Lexapro had worked quite well for a friend of mine. I had previously taken Zoloft a few years prior &amp; it made my post-partum depression worse. 
I had great hopes for this drug, but it unfortunately did NOT work well for me. I felt like a zombie. I believe it gave me psychosis. I also experienced my first panic attack after being on 10 MG for 3 days. I then took 5 MG for two more days and stopped taking it all together. 
Still 3 months after stopping I am having panic attacks with some psychotic features.
I&#039;ve pulled myself out of that deep depression though. Still have bad days occasionally, but I&#039;m only taking Xanax as needed."
