"I am tapering off of Paxil and on to generic Lexapro by taking one-third my normal dose of Paxil at night and a half dose of escitalopram in the morning. On the fifth day I will just be taking Lexapro at 20 mg daily, per my doctor. I am doing fine, but back when I first started my Paxil in 2009, I had an initial spike in anxiety; I had upped my dose too soon on the advice of a social worker without checking with my doctor, and I was extremely anxious, so I took Xanax temporarily with the Paxil, and I gradually started feeling better over a few weeks, and over the years Paxil has helped. I&#039;m switching to Lexapro, though, since I have started to gain a little weight, and I hope that I can lose those pounds by swiching."
