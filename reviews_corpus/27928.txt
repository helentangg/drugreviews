"I have been on this drug for about 10 years, I have tried to slowly come off of it, thinking Im ok but it was a disaster, dont let your pride effect your life! I was going through divorce, stress at work, and overall angry thoughts and depression. What it did for me was make the bad moments less extended, I still get stressed and have normal bad days but the lingering of these moments lessened. I never post this type of stuff, but I hope I can help someone, this med may have saved my marriage and my childrens upbringing!!! i did have to incrwase dose after a couple years though"
