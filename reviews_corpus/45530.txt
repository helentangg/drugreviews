"Not happy, not sad, just there. Actually not even there... Everything is kind of like a daze. But it feels alot better then being crazy stressed out all the time and freaking out over trivial things, just I don&#039;t feel like myself. But the good thing is I&#039;m living in the moment instead of the past or worrying about the future."
