"I have been on and off of antidepressants my whole life. I have been on Lexapro for a year and it helped tons. I don&#039;t feel depressed anymore but it seems that I don&#039;t have a range of emotions.  I always seem somewhat subdued, not able to cry, don&#039;t get very excited about anything. I have trouble falling asleep and actually getting good sleep. I guess because of that I am often tired during the day. The sexual side effects are irritating. I gained a little weight but I also quit smoking so that may have had a part in the weight gain.  On a positive note, I am not so overwhelmed with worrying.  I can concentrate much better at school. My irritability has lessened. I feel sane again."
