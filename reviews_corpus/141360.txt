"Before taking Lexapro I would be very uncomfortable around  people and I would become depressed because I continued to deal with mild obsessive compulsive disorder.  My job is also very stressful as I am a manager at an entertainment business and would obsess over my job so I would not miss any details.  I had no time for life outside of work because I would obsess over my job and &quot;worse case scenario&quot;.  I am a 26 year old and when I was younger, around 17,  doctors would treat me with all types of depressive medications.  With negative outcomes, I decided young that I would not take any more medications and &quot;toughen&quot; it out.   NOW with events leading up to me taking Lexapro, I am a new person and I don&#039;t worry about little things any more.  The OCD is GONE!"
