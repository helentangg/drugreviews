"Started Lexapro (Escitalopram) 10 mg taken at 8:00am  2 wks ago for anxiety and mild agoraphobia due to worry over having an anxiety attack-a tsunami of nervousness would overwhelm me and make me fearful and filled with unease. I was always worried about why this was happening to me out of nowhere. And I avoided going to places I once enjoyed. After day 12 a switch flipped.  I felt myself again, happy, easy going, not worried, not anticipating something bad was going to happen. What I cannot handle is the sleep disruption this drug has caused.  Waking at 3, 4 am and unable to get back to sleep.  Dr. prescribed  .50 mg Xanax, which is helping me through this side effect.  Hopefully it will subside when my body adjusts to the serotonin levels"
