"I took Paxil for 5 years. I have been off Paxil now for 7 years, and ...I suffer from OCD and panic attacks. I am 49 years old and have suffered since childhood with my &quot;issues&quot;. I won&#039;t go into great detail.I do not take medicine, but I was in VERY bad shape when I started on Paxil.  Within a few days, I slept, stopped washing my feet, counting things, and those obsessive thoughts were gone.THANK GOD. I did gain weight, and my family described me as being an emtional zombie. I chose to discontinue taking Paxil on my own, which was a bad idea. NEVER. I say NEVER do that. I am lucky that I am still alive. If you choose to quit taking it please do that only under the care of your physician. Today I am not cured, but I am happy and living norm"
