"I am finishing my 4th week of Viibryd.  I&#039;m afraid to jinx myself by saying this, but I feel I have my old life back again.  The reality of being on an anti-depressant (Viibryd) and being MORE sexual MORE quickly is heaven to me!  I have renewed hopes about a future I never thought I&#039;d see.  My last marriage ended because of Zoloft, Effexor, you name it, and hard to date, too, and explain why nothing&#039;s working and it isn&#039;t going to work.  Please keep working, Viibryd!!  My only side effect has been two nights of terrifying nightmares.  I&#039;ll take those any day over not being able to be a complete woman."
