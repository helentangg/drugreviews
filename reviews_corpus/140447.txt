"I was taking Cipralex (a type of escitalopram in UK) for about 2 years and it has to be one of the worst medications I&rsquo;ve been on. At first, it was very useful, I was very suicidal, hated everything about life and Cipralex made me less suicidal by making me numb. I was never happy, I was never sad, I was just constantly living in a numb state. I had stopped eating, lost interest in everything, stopped a bit of my social life but at least I wasn&rsquo;t planning ways to kill myself. After 2 years, I stopped taking it and I actually became happy again. I was able to have more emotions than just nothingness and I was able to get out of bed easier and enjoy life. This medication is good if you want to stop being suicidal but don&#039;t stay on it for too long."
