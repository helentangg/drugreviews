"I am 42 and began taking Cymbalta 4 weeks ago. I started with 30mg for 2 weeks, and am currently taking 60mg a day. I began taking this drug due to the advice of my doctor after approaching him about my uncontrolable anger issues that have plagued me my entire adult life. I have to say that it has been a lifesaver. I have never gone 1 week, never mind 4 weeks without an anger outburst or stress related outburst. My family is happier..I am happier...I have never felt this great...only side effects are some dry mouth at night and occasional tiredness during the day...an easy trade off for a drug that has given me my life back!!!"
