"Viibryd is pretty great. It is strong yet subtle. I&#039;ve tried every antidepressant (SSRI/SNRI/SSNRI) and it is the only one that works well for me. I am having virtually no side effects except for tiredness but it has been getting better. I had diarrhea for the first weak but it was tolerable. It doesn&#039;t dull my emotions. It makes me feel normal and stable! Great medication for me and the only SSRI type medication that works. Maybe this has to do with it being a partial serotonin agonist as well as being a serontin reuptake inhibitor."
