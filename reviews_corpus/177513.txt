"I took 1 30mg and it has made me so sick. I&#039;ve been having flu like symptoms and my anxiety is through the roof. I couldn&#039;t sleep last night and this was just taking 1. I normally take Valium 20mg a day and Ativan 1mg and I&#039;m ok but lately with all meds I think my body after so many years is used to the benzodiazepines they aren&#039;t working as well. I&#039;m still having panic attacks that are disabling. I need help. Every SSRI or SNRI  doesn&#039;t not work at all. I took from my teens until I was 22 ecstasy everyday and when I stopped is when the anxiety started and has never left even though I&#039;ve been quit for 11 years. I don&#039;t want to be on medications any more I just want to live life that&#039;s all :( this medicine ruined an entire day for me."
