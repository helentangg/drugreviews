"I started on Cymbalta 30 mg and it improved my mood so my prescriber increased to 60 mg.  60 mg caused increased irritability and negative thinking so I decided to taper off.  This caused flu-like symptoms and &quot;the shakes&quot; so started researching Cymbalta withdrawal.  Surprisingly, a LOT of people have similar symptoms when coming off Cymbalta.  The only way to avoid it is to open the capsules and divide the pellets to take a gradually reduced dose over several weeks.  My prescriber suggested returning to 30 mg to alleviate the withdrawal symptoms and I have stayed there for the past 2 months.  I am back to experiencing positive effects - I feel like I am coming out of a fog I didn&#039;t realize had been surrounding me for years."
