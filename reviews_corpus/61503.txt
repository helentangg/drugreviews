"I have been on citalopram for 6 weeks, when I started had very few side effects, feeling a lot better, can control my thoughts. started on 10 mg for 2 weeks , and on 20 mg . It seems like it was the one for me , all the other antidepressants gave me bad side effects. This one is working well so far . gets better as the weeks go by ."
