"I was on Effexor XR (generic brand) for about 6 weeks. I am in the process of tapering off (It&#039;s NOT as bad as some people say.) While this medication did help tremendously with, both, anxiety and depression, it had its fair share of side effects that I could not live with: it exacerbated my migraines, made me feel a bit &quot;numb&quot; and unmotivated, and interrupted my sleep/caused me to oversleep, missing many appointments for therapy. This medication WAS helpful but it also caused harm. No major side effects when starting except headache, dizziness and nausea. The dizziness passed after 1 month."
