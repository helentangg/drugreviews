"Prozac has allowed me to enjoy life and handle more stressful situations without the depression.  I am much more focused, have far more confidence and a greater feeling of self worth. I took Prozac approximately 7 years ago for severe depression and gradually stopped within 12 months when I felt I no longer needed it.  Unfortunately this year has been difficult and very stressful and once again I was suffering from ongoing depression, hence my recent return to Prozac to assist me cope.  I would rather find other ways to control my depression but have tried many things and Prozac seems to work. I work full time and have worked in the same job for over 17 years and Prozac allows me continue doing what I love."
