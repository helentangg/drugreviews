"I have been off anti-depressants for about 7 months then I needed to go back on when I entered a very heavy ward (I&#039;m a nurse) because I was becoming very anxious and could not work as well as I was. I WAS on Zoloft but now am trying Pristiq. I have been on Pristiq for 2 weeks now, the first few days I had side effects - increased anxiety, insomnia, nausea and increased sweating but all side effects have now subsided. 

Positives:
- I have not had any anxiety this week and have been confident at work
- No depressive symptoms
- I have lost weight (not meant to be good but I&#039;m happy about it).

Negatives:
- I have noticed a slight decrease in libido which might turn out to be a problem and that&#039;s what I was scared of."
