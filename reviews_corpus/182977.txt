"I have been on Cymbalta for about two weeks. I have severe depression, two failed back operations, and neuropathy in my legs and feet; those stabbing hot jabs of pain and also pain throughout my body and joints. On day three of being on Cymbalta I had body and joint pain relief and some increased sensitivity in my feet. Still having back pain but that was expected as my back is toast. The vivid dreams were disturbing for about a week, but have gone away. I had hallucinations as I was awaking each morning. That has gone away as well. My depression seems to be lifting and I feel more active. Good luck on Cymbalta."
