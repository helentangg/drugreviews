"I have been taking fluoxetine for three years- since my husband left me during my pregnancy.  I was having suicidal and homicidal thoughts- I was trying to think of ways to kill him and get away with it.  When I started taking Prozac, those disappeared and I was  coping with reality much better.  I recently (about 8 weeks ago) stopped taking it after I read a study that suggested that many people imagined their reactions to antidepressants- I wanted to see if there was truth to that.  BIG MISTAKE.  I have been moody, crying at the drop of a hat, and VERY angry all the time at pretty much anyone- even my three year old.  Going back to the Prozac ASAP- even with the low libido side effect."
