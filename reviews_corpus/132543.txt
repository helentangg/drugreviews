"My doctor prescribed Doxepin 45 mg  &quot;at bedtime&quot; to help me move my sleep cycle back to  a normal time - it had gradually slipped later and later until I wasn&#039;t getting sleepy until 4-6 am. My experience is that Doxepin is useless for this purpose (confirmed by my pharmacist) - it does not help me fall asleep at all, but it will keep me asleep for much longer which unfortunately is just reinforcing my shifted sleep cycle.  In addition I&#039;ve had lots of side-effects, ranging from a mild headache to migraine halos, irritability, anxiety, and worst of all, a 20 point rise in the first blood glucose reading after waking.  If your problem is staying asleep this will probably help, but if your problem is falling asleep it&#039;s pretty useless,"
