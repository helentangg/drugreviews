"I have been on 40mg Celexa for well over a year.  I was put on it after my depression didn&#039;t respond to Prozac.  It made me tired for the first few weeks and whenever my doctor increased the dose, but that subsides.  It does not help much for anxiety for me, but greatly improves my depression."
