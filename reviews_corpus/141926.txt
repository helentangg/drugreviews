"I&#039;m a 28 year old female and I started using Lexapro (10mg) after visiting my doctor and having my lab results back normal. Immediately it did three things: Made me EXTREMELY tired all the time, constipated and never hungry. I had to stop the medication after 8 days because the fatigue was too much to handle. They say it takes 4 to 6 weeks to feel effects but these came right away. Since being off my hunger and bowel movement went back to normal but I&#039;m still so tired all of the time. I can&#039;t seem to ever have energy even after coffee. I&#039;m scared I have triggered something else by taking Lexapro and wonder if I will ever feel energetic again. I&#039;ve been off it a month now, the only positive thing I experienced was losing weight."
