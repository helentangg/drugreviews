"Been on it one month. Put on after a suicide attempt. I am no longer obsessing  about suicide but I can&#039;t get out of bed. It has reduced my anxiety very much, which is great. I was terrified of everything. But I wish I had the energy and desire to get up and do something during the day. So I&#039;m still depressed but hoping for more improvement since I no longer want to kill  myself."
