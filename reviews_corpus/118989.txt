"I started taking Zoloft 50mg yesterday.  I feel a lot better in terms of my mood.  However, I am jittery.  My hands are trembling, pupils are dilated and have dry mouth.  I do understand that I have to let it work its way into my system so I&#039;m sticking with it.  It&#039;s been 1 day!  I&#039;m glad to see that some of the positive responses had the same immediate side effects that I&#039;m dealing with right now.  I am giving it a chance to work, honestly haven&#039;t felt anxious all day."
