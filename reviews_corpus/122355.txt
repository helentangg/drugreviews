"I have tried what feels like every medicine available for the past 10 years, and this is the first time that I feel like I enjoy life for long periods of time. Sure, with severe depression/anxiety, you will always have down days, but since taking this medicine, they have become less, and the depressed feeling doesn&#039;t last as long. I&#039;m pretty upbeat now, and sometimes can be very chatty."
