"My husband&#039;s doctor put him on this last month.  Nothing she has put him on for depression/anxiety has worked. So she decided to try this, while she titrated him off Effexor.  Huge mistake!  He&#039;s worse than ever.  Debating whether he should be admitted somewhere.  He has been having brain &quot;zaps,&quot;  nightmares, loss of appetite, nausea, suicidal ideation. "
