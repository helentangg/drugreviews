"I thought this was the best one yet. However, I experienced EXTREME nausea which worsened with an increase from 50mg to 100mg. I am going through a wash out period now and not sure what my physician will start me on now.
Besides having the Nausea, I also had Gastrointestinal symptoms of abdominal cramping, diarrhea, and flatulence (gas). The medication was working for me, but the side effects made me miss work, not do my school work and affected my social life. I have been off of it for 5 days now and feeling NO nausea and much much better. Glad that it works for some of you!"
