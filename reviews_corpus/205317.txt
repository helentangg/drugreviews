"I know one week of treatment is not a fair chance to give a medication to judge its effectiveness, I&#039;m only reviewing the side effects. I was on the 50mg dose and the first 2-3 days were fine; no side effects noticed. However, my appetite significantly decreased to the point where I had to force myself to eat or I would go an entire day without eating. And I couldn&#039;t eat much when I did eat. I had cloudy urine and didn&#039;t have a strong flow; which made me think I had a UTI without the burning. Lower abdominal pain, some diarrhea. Lethargic all the time, no motivation to do anything. Not depressed, just didn&#039;t wanna get out of bed. Felt sleepy but couldn&#039;t sleep even with sleep mess. When I did sleep, it was very broken."
