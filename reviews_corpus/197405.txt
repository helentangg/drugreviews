"I took Paxil for about 10 yrs (no weight gain) and quit it recently with the help of my primary care doctor by weaning off of it for 6 months.  Unfortunately, 2 weeks after quitting, my symptoms of anxiety and depression have returned 2-fold!  I have not been formally diagnosed with anything yet, but do know that Paxil worked the BEST for me!  I want to go back on it, but it is Category D- so IF I ever want to have a baby I cannot be on it while pregnant!  
At the moment, I am trying Wellbutrin, after trying 3 weeks on Buspar to help me (that didn&#039;t help).  It&#039;s only been a week on Wellbutrin and I see some improvements, but nothing like the Paxil.  I may ask to go back to Paxil if switching medicines doesn&#039;t work. I felt like &quot;myself&quot; on Paxil!"
