"I have been taking Pristiq for 2 years now and feel normal and stable.  I have been prescribed Pristiq for major depression which I have experienced most of my post pubertal life.  I have taken various medicines which have had differing side effects, e.g. Cipramil, Luvox, Prozac and for me, Pristiq has been the most well tolerated.  I have not had any dryness, nausea or dizziness thank heavens.  I don&#039;t cry for no reason any more and I have not had any suicide thoughts or plans since being on this medicine. I am currently going through a very stressful time (partner out of work) and am considering asking the doctor to increase my dose as I am experiencing unusually high levels of anxiety."
