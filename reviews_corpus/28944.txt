"I was slowly suffering from anxiety (through high school) and never really knew it. About 3 years ago (age 29) I began to have anxiety and panic attacks after a vet visit with my cat. I seizured from the anxiety of being in the vet office and from then on for about a year the anxiety turned into panic attacks at work, meetings, car, home. It wasn&#039;t until I finally had a full on panic attack (felt like a heart attack) and had to go to hospital that I was prescribed Lexapro. I did not want to accept the fact that I needed to take medicine for something psychological. I always tried to fight things with my mind. Over the past 2 years I am glad I was prescribed Lexapro. It has completely changed my anxiety. I still have occasionall anxiety but no attacks. Main side effect was low sex drive."
