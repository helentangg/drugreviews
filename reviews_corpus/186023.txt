"I started taking Pristiq 100mg Last July. Initially I had headaches, mood swings, anxiousness and found it hard to sleep. This lasted about a week. With the initial combination of melatonin I was able to get into a routine of taking the pristiq in the morning and melatonin at night, both roughly at the same time to sleep the same amount each day. For nine months I have taken pristiq by itself now and have found that it has significantly decreased anxiety, stopped me from internalising almost completely and has reduced my mood swings considerably. I have slightly reduced sex drive, put on a bit of weight and a want to smoke and fidget. I have found pristiq beneficial to my life but frustrating at times."
