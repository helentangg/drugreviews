"My doctor prescribed me 25mg of sertraline after 2 years of trying to manage my depression and anxiety without medication. So far, it&#039;s given me headaches, made me tired all the time, and I have found my sex drive to disappear. It&#039;s been one week, and I&#039;ve had a few bad days and panic attacks, but I know from reading other&#039;s experiences and from what my doctor said to give it at least 4 weeks to feel the effects. I am hopeful that this medication will help me despite the rocky start!"
