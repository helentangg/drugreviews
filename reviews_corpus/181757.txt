"I took Prozac for several years to treat my depression and it was awesome. It had few side effects but gave me my life back. I went from not leaving my bed to actually being a productive member of society again. I did lose a good deal of weight while I was on it but that eventually balanced out.  I took it until it got to the point where it stopped working for me and I&#039;ve never found anything that has worked as well.  Hopefully I will be able to take it and have it work for me again one day."
