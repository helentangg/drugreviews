"I started taking it after my husband passed away; he had a cardiac problem and I tried to unsuccessfully help him.  I did call the emergency services, they tried but were unable to help him.  After that I could not get thoughts about the incident out of my mind and I lost in excess of 50lbs the next month.  I was given Zoloft by my doctor which did interrupt my &#039;panic&#039;, however I only took the medicine for less than one month as I couldn&#039;t think properly.  I rely on my mind, my thoughts to process how I relate to the &#039;world&#039; - I decided that being sad about the situation was appropriate and a normal response.  In the eighteen years since then I have not needed medication for depression - other things yes, but not mood disorders.  Thank you."
