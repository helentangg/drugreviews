"Even though I had lots of side effects from this medication including over sleeping, day time fatigue and nausea it still helped me get a decent night&#039;s sleep and helped with the nerve pain when combined with Cymbalta. I&#039;m taking a lower dose (50mg) and as time goes by the side effects are lessening."
