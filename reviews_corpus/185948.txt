"MY PCP prescribed pristiq for my depression, anxiety, mood issues etc. He told me that the drug takes a few weeks before you could see a difference but I feel like I experienced everything the first day I took the drug. Although my mood and energy improved and felt better overall the side effects were so severe I decided to discontinue after the first day. My side effects started with heart palpitations, sweating, dizziness and a faint feeling. This later subsided but turned into nausea and loss of appetite I couldn&#039;t eat anything that day and even water made me gag. That night I slept for a total of 3 hours I couldn&#039;t stay asleep and the time I did fall asleep it felt like I wasn&#039;t asleep at all. My body felt numb and my heart was racing."
