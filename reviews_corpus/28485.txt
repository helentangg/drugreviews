"I suffered from anxiety disorder for 5 years without knowing what it was and after seeing numerous doctors and undergoing numerous medical tests and scans, it all came to naught. The symptoms were very vague and debilitating such as overall weakness, trembling, dizziness and even the simplest chore of lifting a pen results in strange feelings in the body. 
Finally a doc gave me Lexapro 10mg and my life was saved!
Since then I have taken Lexapro (6mths) and stopped and it has relapsed twice and the longest time I survived without Lexapro was 1.5 yrs. Now I believe I have anxiety disorder and need help and Lexapro really helps."
