"I have been on many anti depressants and by far...Prozac gave me my life back. I am bi polar with PTSD and anxiety. I did lose weight and that was okay. I can sleep and am a happy woman again. I take 20mg each morning. I do not need a benzo for anxiety any longer oh and I am 33 years old. After fifteen years of Zoloft, lexapro, Paxil, Effexor, wellbutrin, you name it, I&#039;ve been on it for long periods, changed to Prozac 6 months ago, I have my life back."
