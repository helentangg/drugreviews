"I started taking lexapro for anxiety and depression. My anxiety was so bad at times, I felt like I was having mini panic attacks. The worst part of my day was the thought of waking up and having to go to work. I have 3 children and felt like I couldn&#039;t take care of them, thank god for my family. Besides the occasional Advil for a headache, I do not take any other medications and didn&#039;t really like the idea of being on this type of medication. BUT, you know what? I have a family, friends, a career, and house, so if I have to take a little pill to feel better, then so be it. I&#039;m just glad I don&#039;t have to suffer and there is help out there."
