"I have taken Prozac for about fifteen years. No more cyclical valleys of depression followed by highs. Capable of handling extreme stress, exercising, weekly sex - reduced libido. My weight has stayed the SAME. The two to three times of exercising a week is all it takes to be healthy. Only downside is acting out dreams 3-4 times a year and kicking legs while sleeping. The dreams I can&#039;t predict. The kicking legs can be sensed in early evening and I just take two Liquid Advils to subdue them. Life Is Good!"
