"I was previously on Prozac 20mg and switched to Viibryd because of the sexual side effects I was experiencing. Within two weeks I was back to my original depression with thoughts of suicide, uncontrollable crying, terrifying dreams, and mood swings. While transitioning my libido did come back, which was nice. However, I was forced to go back on Prozac and felt totally normal again within a week."
