"I have been on several anxiety/depression medications over the last 30 years and always had some kind of side effect. I would either get an allergic reaction or it would make my anxiety worse.
Finally tried Brintellix 10 mg. two months ago, and I feel great, I have had no side effects what so ever. I just feel normal. I rarely take Xanax now and can go to sleep and usually sleep thru the night.
I am still taking free samples from my doctor as my Insurance company will not cover. I have sent in an appeal for them to reconsider..my fingers are crossed"
