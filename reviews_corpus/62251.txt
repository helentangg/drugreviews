"I was on Celexa for approximately 3-6 months for depression. This was my first antidepressant ever, so I didn&#039;t know what to expect. The only side effect I remember experiencing was dry mouth which was annoying, but very tolerable and temporary. Celexa very effectively eliminated my short temper/ snappiness, crying fits and it greatly enhanced my mood and outlook on life. On one occasion, while reflecting on a depressing exchange, I realized that I might be suicidal. I advised my doctor but continued to take it with no more problems but ultimately stopped because I didn&#039;t want to be dependent on medicines.  The depression is back and I was switched to Viibryd."
