"I&#039;ve just read a load of reviews people have wrote and none of them have admitted to or have not had any problems with ejaculation. I have only been on sertraline 50mg for four days now but haven&#039;t been able to ejaculate since starting the medication. 

Now this side effect at the minute i&#039;m loving because it&#039;s great for the lady buy does or has anybody else had this side effect?

Another side effect i&#039;ve noticed is headaches that are effecting my sleep at but for now i will just see what happens."
