"I&#039;ve been taking the off brand for over 2 weeks and I&#039;m starting to feel the anxiety reducing effects. No nausea or GI problems thus far. For the first 3 days I felt a little out of it around an hour and a half after taking it, so I started taking it at night and that has completely resolved the issue. Started on 10mg for around 9 days to get accustomed to it and have been on the 20 mg for 2 days now. My anxiety wasn&#039;t severe (diagnosed w mild anxiety-stress related) &amp; no panic attacks. I think the type of anxiety/severity will influence the way the drug acts on you, but it&#039;s been good for me so far :)"
