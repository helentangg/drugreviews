"I have been experiencing significant feelings of my &quot;brain hurting&quot; with it feeling like it wanted to bust out of my skull, was overwhelmed by sounds and sights, feeling off-kilter b/c of brain dizziness.  All affected my cognitive functioning (can&#039;t think, difficulty processing information, very bad memory, couldn&#039;t express myself verbally). Have had just about every scan done possible, showing nothing of concern.  My neurologist started me on 25 mg. ofNortriptyline, and the head-hurting has stopped!Still some dizziness and difficulty processing information. Only side effect is dry mouth and a bad taste in my mouth, so always carry water.  Happy with just this change as a place to start! I used to just cry, hold my head and stay home."
