"Cymbalta was my first attempt at antidepressants. It was prescribed for both anxiety and extreme depression. Before Cymbalta I was literally non-functioning. After a week of taking it, with Zero side effects, I felt like a different person. A better person. I did have my occasional bad day, but nothing like before. I am no longer on Cymbalta because my insurance dropped it. I moved from it to Pristiq with virtually no withdrawals. I would take it again in a heartbeat."
