"Citalopram has been a life saver for me. I&#039;ve gone on and off of it over the past 5-6 years, but I&#039;ve currently been on it for a year straight and it&#039;s seriously helped me so much. I have awful, debilitating anxiety. Citalopram has really helped. I still have anxiety, but it is so much more manageable and I&#039;m able to get through the anxiety attacks so much easier and faster than when I&#039;m not on the medication. The only issue is that it has caused severe TMJ for me. It causes me to grind and clench my teeth really bad. I&#039;d honestly rather have TMJ than crippling anxiety, though. I&#039;ve been on 20 mg for the past year, but was on 40 mg 5 years ago."
