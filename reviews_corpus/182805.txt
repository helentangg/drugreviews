"First dose made me sick feeling, nauseous, stomach issues.  Created too many problems, I rather live with anxiety. Wish the drug people would come out with something new, w/o so many bad side effects. I will not take this drug ever.  My anxiety is mild compared to many.  I can function pretty good most of the time. Things are very stressful for me now with a sick husband.
Don&#039;t take this drug."
