"At first I was on Citalpram and I kept having the dosage bumped up. Then I switched to Pristiq which came along with a few mild symptoms including nausea. Then it went away, and I noticed a change in my anxiety levels. I became confortable in my school environment for a change. After being on it almost 6 months, I am beginning to think it has quit working, and is giving me some constipation and belly pain. But who knows, that could just be something else. I recommend at least trying the drug if you need it."
