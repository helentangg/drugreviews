"I was prescribed Pristiq in February 2009. While at first Pristiq seemed like an answer to my prayers in that I felt less anxious and less depressed, this past week I sank back into the deep depression. I&#039;ll be seeing a psychiatrist to re-evaluate my medication needs this week. While on Pristiq I&#039;ve experienced significant fatigue, intense chest pain and sexual dysfunction. "
