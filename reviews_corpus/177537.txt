"My right arm &amp; hand were in horrific pain, nothing gave me relief.  I suffered for 3 weeks and lost a lot of sleep while waiting to see a neurologist.  Doctor prescribed Cymbalta for peripheral neuropathy and within days the pain began to subside, after 2 weeks I&#039;m just about pain free.  It was making me feel groggy at work so I just altered the time I take it, from morning to evening and it worked out well."
