"I have been on pristiq for approx 2 weeks for anxiety and dizziness and disequilibrium. The first week was rough with sweating and a little nausea but no tiredness.

From day 9 I have noticed a good boost in energy and a change in how I have been managing my anxiety with increased confidence and reduced dizziness.

I will keep taking it but won&#039;t be looking forward to coming off it when the time comes. It has given me a new out look on life which is a big positive."
