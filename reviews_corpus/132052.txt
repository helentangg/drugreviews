"I&#039;ve been taking Effexor XR since mid-2005 to help me through a major depressive episode in my life.  Took it in conjunction with Remeron, which helped me immensely with improving my sleep and improving my mood.  
Watch for withdrawal symptoms (reduce drug by taking a few grains out of the capsule each time). Do not go off cold turkey. Would be a 10/10 except that I have the sexual side effect. However I&#039;d rather be happy/non-suicidal than easily aroused."
