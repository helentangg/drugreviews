"52 year old female. I had recurring mid range to severe headaches which became migraines for several years. I had them so often, I was taking tons of over the counter headache pills, which then damaged my stomach after long term excessive use. After finally telling my doctor about them, he put me on Nortiptyline, (2) 10mg pills every night, so 20mg total daily.  It was like a miracle for me! Within a very short time, I was 95% migraine free. It has no side effects for me and I have eliminated my excessively large intake of over the counter pills almost entirely. What a huge impact this medication has made for me."
