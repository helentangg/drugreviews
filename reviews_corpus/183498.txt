"I have been on Cymbalta for almost 4 years now and it has been a lifesaver for me.  The first few weeks I had some loose stools, but that subsided.  The only problem I have with it now is keeping weight off.  I have trouble loosing weight and I think it is due to the Cymbalta.  I eat a well balanced diet and exercise.  However, due to the numerous medicines I had tried before that failed me for anxiety and depression, I will keep taking the Cymbalta.  I&#039;d rather be fat then feel the way I felt before."
