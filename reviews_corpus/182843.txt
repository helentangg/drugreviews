"I have  Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Associated Periodic Syndrome (TRAPS Syndrome) and am in near constant pain (joints, pleurisy &amp; abdominal)
I started with 90mg of Cymbalta after breakfast and it certainly takes the edge off of the pain! I don&#039;t really have any side effects to speak of. I also take Plaquenil &amp; Sulfasalazine for joint stiffness and rash with fever."
