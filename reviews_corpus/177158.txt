"I took my first dose of generic Cymbalta last night of 60 milligrams. It&#039;s now 5:47 PM &amp; I&#039;ve not eaten all day due to the severe nausea. I&#039;m also very jittery, anxious, have a super, really bad headache (I&#039;m also prone to migraines.), &amp; my tinnitus is worse in my left ear. I also have slept most of the day, besides. I have depression &amp; mild PTSD &amp; anxiety &amp; migraines, I&#039;ve been on other anti-depressants before. Prozac increased my migraines the last time. I think this generic of Cymbalta won&#039;t be for me."
