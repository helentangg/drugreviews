"Stating taking Viibryd for severe OCD sexual thoughts.  After 6 weeks of being on 40mg did not notice much of a difference for my intrusive thoughts.  Good thing was no sexual side effects like I had with Lexapro.  Going back to my doctor to try my third SSRI...maybe Zoloft, Prozac, or Paxil this time."
