"I have unexplained nerve pain for about two years..after trying so many pills I was at the end of my hope. All the pills either made me feel like a zombie or I gained weight. 
I tried 10 mg of Nortriptyline and it has given me back my life! I have been on them for around 3 months now and hardly any pain."
