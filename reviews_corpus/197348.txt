"I took this medicine in college and it really did help with the incessant worrying. However, it made me a careless pleasure seeker who engaged in risky and unproductive behavior. Needless to say I received a 0.0 GPA the one semester I took it.  I did enjoy my time however and still have fond memories but know now that I have too many lazy tendencies to take this medicine."
