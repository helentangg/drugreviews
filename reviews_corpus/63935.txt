"I&#039;ve been on sertraline for about 3 years now. I&#039;ve been suffering from abnormal anxiety since I was about 10, and decided to finally get on medication at age 16. At first, I was put on 50mg --25mg for the first four days, then began taking 50mg-- and at first, it was a bit difficult to tell whether it worked or not. After about 3 months, I really couldn&#039;t feel any difference from when I was off of it. It took about half a year for me to find the right dosage, which is now 200mg, and it works a lot better than I expected it to. I used to panic for no reason, the attacks occurring mostly at night when I needed to go to bed. Now, I really only have anxiety if there is an actual trigger. And if I do feel anxious for no reason, its manageable."
