"THANK god for this drug. I can honestly say they have completely turned my life around. Striking a conversation with an old friend or a stranger used to be incredibly awkward and I would over analyze my words. Now, I&rsquo;m completely comfortable talking to anyone and I really don&rsquo;t seem to be bothered by a whole lot. I really do believe this drug has not only changed my life but it has saved my relationship and done wonders for my social life. I have switched to Cipralex due to some side effects, I feel it has the same benefits as Celexa but is much cleaner. For anyone in the beginning stages of this drug, (especially experiencing no libido, digestive issues, insomnia), please just stick it out, I PROMISE it gets much better!"
