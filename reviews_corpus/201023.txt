"These reviews helped me so much when I first started Zoloft over 5 weeks ago that I wanted to post my experience.  After several weeks of increasingly worsening panic attacks at work, I ended up in the hospital. A year ago my psych Dr switched me from cymbalta to a mood stabilizer and things were good until November as stress at work increased.  I was depending on too much bromazepam to get through the day.  My GP started me on 50 mg of Zoloft and my anxiety was so bad also tremors for 4 weeks I was sure I would have to quit working or cut my hours.  But this Monday on week 5 was amazing.  I still have some anxiety but I seem to be able to handle it now.  It&#039;s like I have my confidence back. Good luck!"
