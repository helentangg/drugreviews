"I finally made the decision to seek professional help for my depression/major anxiety.  After trying to self heal for 2 years, I realized that I couldn&#039;t beat the anxiety on my own.  I cried the night before my Dr. appointment, due to feelings of failure because I couldn&#039;t cure it myself, and I also cried through my entire appointment.  I was severely depressed from having to live with anxiety and fear.  A horrible and embarrassing thing to live with.  My Dr. perscribed me Celexa and I honestly didn&#039;t think it would work.  I almost gave up taking Celexa because it took 3 weeks to kick in and I am impatient.  After taking Celexa, I find that I am much calmer. I don&#039;t worry about things and I am happier and less fearful.  Only side effect is grinding of teeth."
