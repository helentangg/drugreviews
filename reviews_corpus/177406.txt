"I was experiencing anxiety and depression for awhile. Being a full time student didn&#039;t help the situation at all so I finally decided to get on a medication that my doctor recommended and one that wouldn&#039;t have a side effect of weight gain. The first week I woke up in the middle of the night with huge panic attacks and feeling like I didn&#039;t know where I was at! After a few days, I realized it was just a side effect of my medication. Another side effect I experienced the first week was being extremely tired. So tired that I had to pull over while I was driving one day and have my brother take over. Now that I&#039;ve been on Duloxetene 30mg for a few weeks it has done wonders! My mood is so much more stabilized. High recommend this drug!! :)"
