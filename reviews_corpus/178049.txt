"I have severe neck pain from herniated discs, bulging disc, foraminal stenosis, osteophytes and arthritic changes in the neck. I was also depressed from chronic
pain and anxious about the pain. It has interfered with my life and stopped me from enjoying life. I started on Cymbalta about a month ago. My pain seems to have improved some but has not yet gone away. The side effects have been troublesome including dry mouth, constipation, palpitations, rapid heart rate, some sweating, tremor, and difficulty urinating. I plan to give the mediation three months before I suggest a change to my doctor, based on the comments above. Hope it works."
