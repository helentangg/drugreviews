"I took 10mg Celexa (increased to 20mg) for a year after experiencing panic attacks and generalized anxiety for 3 years.  My anxiety affected my stomach the worst, I&#039;d have trouble eating anything without getting a stomach ache or diarrhea. It&#039;s as if all the butterflies in my stomach ate my food for me.  After taking Celexa my anxiety disappeared completely and my stomach went back to normal.  However, I stopped taking it due to the side effects.  I had no more sex drive, and had difficulty feeling any emotions, or at least to the extent I felt them before.  I felt foggy and not myself.  Soon as I went off it I had panic attacks again but felt more clear."
