"Hi , I need info about Effexor [ venlafaxine ] 225 mg . Two weeks ago , i had a drug test required for my job . The result turn out false positive for cocaine ! I am 57 years old male , and totally never took cocaine in my life . I was fired on the spot from my job . I am devastated . There was no way that i could protest this result . I am a pipelines worker , and in my 37 years experience at work , this has never happend to me . This was a urine test . 
Please , if anybody here can help with advices , i would be so grateful . This is absolutely unfair , unreal .

Thanks for reading 
Peace
Rene"
