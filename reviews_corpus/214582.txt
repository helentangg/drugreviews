"Took lexapro for 4 weeks, 5mg, didn&rsquo;t have any side affects or notice any changes until the 4th week, I just suddenly realized I actually felt normal.  Stopped taking it after that and then went back on it in July when I was at one of my lowest moments I had ever experienced. I had one moment where I felt I could no longer cope and understood that suicide is about taking away your own pain, not about hurting others. Been taking it for three months now and back to my normal self. Enjoy social gatherings, have more energy, not so much social anxiety. Still only take 5mg, half a pill and it is all that I need to feel levelled out. Still zero side affects."
