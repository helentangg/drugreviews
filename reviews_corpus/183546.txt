"6 weeks. Taking it for nerve pain in my back as well as depression. I&#039;ve lost 9 lbs, stopped snapping at my kids over every little thing and not had an argument with my husband since the day I began taking the pills. 60mg a day. I fear withdrawal, but only a little. A friend who has been on it for many many years has to pay for hers, and she goes a week or two at a time without due to finances, and she has never had a brain zap or bad withdrawal at all. My Doctor told me about 10% have a rough time. 
All I can say is I believe things might get better for the first time in years, and I am hoping and dreaming and making plans again. Trouble with orgasms. I&#039;ll live with it."
