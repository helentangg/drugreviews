"I started taking Zoloft and now use the generic sertraline, for two reasons, one was for depression with both of my parents being sick and having to move out of their home and into an assisted living and the second reason was for the &quot;flu-like&quot; symptoms and bad moods that I would have with my monthly period.  I hardly know when I will be starting my period because I don&#039;t have the cramping and mood swings as I had."
