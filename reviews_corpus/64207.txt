"I have dealt with severe panic attacks for over ten years recently they stepped up in intensity to the point of hospitalization multiple times. I was originally given buspar and worked for about two weeks and then my attacks overwelmed the meds. I recently met a doc that put me on sertraline, the first two weeks were very rough due to the transition but then I woke up one day with a literal smile on my face. I take it in the morning cause I have insominia without the med and have no side effects besides a prolonged effort to finish during sex, and a decrease in appetite. This med is what has brought me back to the person loved ones know and miss."
