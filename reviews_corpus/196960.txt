"I have started taking Paxil CR 12.5 mg six months ago, for my stuttering and fear of talking. In the beginning I felt slightly down and kind of panicky, but after 1 week those bad feelings went away completely. 

It has helped me a lot. I can say that my stuttering has improved. I am 80% fluent most of the time and even if I stutter I don&#039;t care that much anymore. I also feel closer to people and more confident in general. I feel happier also, and lost 4 kg due to the appetite loss and feeling full earlier.

Sex drive has decreased a bit, but it does not interfere in my relationship. 

Somedays I get bursts of anger over small things.

It has also cured my insomnia.

Sometimes I feel dizzy but it is not bad and goes away fast."
