"I&#039;m 27 and have been on Lexapro for 8 months. I take 10mg/day (5mg in the morning, 5mg in the evening). I&#039;ve been depressed since I was 14 and as an adult started having severe anxiety. I was in therapy for 10 yrs but still having a lot of trouble functioning. Lexapro has really made me FUNCTIONAL and happy, I enjoy my hobbies/friends more and I no longer obsess about things until I break myself down. MAJOR EFFECT FOR ME IS REDUCING OBSESSIVE THOUGHTS, cycles of worry/loneliness. I&#039;m so happy with this medicine and want to be on it the rest of my life. My friendships, work, and romantic relationships are healthier. Only side effects are drowsiness (fixed by taking 2 small doses instead of 1 big one) and vivid dreams (awesome)."
