"I used Lexapro for a short time because after about a week, I found that I lost all sensation of touch.  I could stick my hand under hot running water and I couldn&#039;t tell you just by touch its general temperature.  Obviously, the rising steam gave a clue.  But I immediately requested to be taken off of it.  When I told my doctor, she thought I was lying.  Wish I could have tried it longer but I prefer not being physically numb."
