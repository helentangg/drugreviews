"I started taking Doxepin for depression and insomnia. It seems to work good for both. I have not experienced any side effects so far.I  had been taking Zoloft for depression and felt like a robot, no feelings at all. I take 2, 10mg at night about an hour before I&#039;m ready to go to sleep. If I don&#039;t go to sleep, I take 1 more. So far I&#039;m happy with the medicine as it works for depression and insomnia."
