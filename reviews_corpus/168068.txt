"Tofranil is THE medicine to take for Panic Disorder. I was diagnosed with Panic Disorder recently, and I was a complete mess. Depressed, suicidal, anxious, the works. My primary care Dr. gave me Xanax. The Xanax helped, but only for short spurts. It also made me more depressed. I was taking up to 3 mg per day, and barely functioning. I got in to see a Psychiatrist, and he is older and more experienced. He immediately knew I had Panic Disorder, and started me on Tofranil. Tofranil absolutely stopped the panic attacks cold. I have been able to cut the Xanax way back, and feel, dare I say, normal. Tofranil is an old medicine, so many docs don&#039;t or won&#039;t try it. Newer is not always better."
