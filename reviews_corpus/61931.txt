"This medication has saved my life!! I have always been a Type A person, a worry wart.  However, as I approached my 40&#039;s I started having major anxiety attacks that left me feeling like I was going crazy.  I was scared to death that I would never find relieve and was terrified about taking pills so I chose to go the natural route with herbs, meditation, exercise and diet.  Those things helped but my anxiety was still out of control so I finally went to see a psych who prescribed Citalopram. The first 6 weeks were HELL with major increased anxiety, insomnia, loss of appetite. My doc prescribed Ativan to help while the Citalopram started working but I was afraid to take them (stupid!). After 6 weeks (30mg) life was wonderful. I&#039;ll never go off"
