"I work for a large Fire Department.  I was having a tough time with some bad calls.  No sleep, always feeling like I&#039;m in trouble, like I&#039;m drowning and no one can help me.  My doctor put me on Celexa and life came back.  I worry about the things I need to be worried about and don&#039;t stress about the things that shouldn&#039;t stress me.  I feel &quot;normal&quot; again.  I believe it saved my career."
