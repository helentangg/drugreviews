"Ok,  Here I go.    Thank God for Zoloft.   I&#039;m 39 and started suffering panic attacks that would last 2-3 months.  I was put on a line of meds which didn&#039;t help until I was prescribed Zoloft.  I started at .25mg for a week and after day 2 my anxiety started to lift and my panic was going away.   Its now been 1 year and I have not experienced anymore Panic episodes or anxiety.  I can&#039;t tell you enough how much it helped me.  I thought I was doomed as nothing worked and I couldn&#039;t go on feeling they way I was. I didn&#039;t want to be left alone as I felt so scared about everything.  My mind was a spinning wheel of negative thoughts and I kept spiralling deeper and deeper until I was given zoloft."
