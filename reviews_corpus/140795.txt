"It&#039;s almost a week since taking 2.5 mg Lexapro in the morning and a quarter seroquel at night. 
The first few days I was irritable and very on edge. The third day I had an anxiety attack while watching tv. It came over me slowly, and didn&#039;t leave that night. 
I have slight hypomania.
If I am in a really challenging situation, I still feel slightly vulnerable and anxious. I hope that when my body is used to the medication that will sort itself out. I do have ringing in my ears, which is annoying. 
I&#039;m not as hungry, and use the toilet a lot more. I can deal with that. I may even lose some weight, which I&#039;ve been battling for years now. 
I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll be stopping lexapro. It seems to be getting better."
