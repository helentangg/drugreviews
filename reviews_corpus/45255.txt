"hi everyone,
I went on Prozac about a year ago after I saw how well it helped my boyfriend. We met two years ago and I knew he was suffering but didn&#039;t know from what. He and I were soon diagnosed with OCD. I was so weary of taking any meds and especially any that said &quot;weight gain as a side effect&quot; because of my obsessive compulsive behavior with my appearance. one day my bf said its okay if you gain a couple if anything you need too said in the nicest way. So I finally gave in and started at 10 mg I later went up to 20 mg and I noticed I didn&#039;t seem to be beating myself up everyday maybe only every few days. I didn&#039;t gain any weight and it even helped with my binge eating disorder. it also helped my more &quot;intense&quot; feelings to &quot;normal&quot;."
