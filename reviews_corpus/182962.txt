"I have had fibro, Depression, anxiety, chronic horrible pain. Cymbalta does nothing at all. I don&#039;t even know why I take it. If you stop it&#039;s worse than stopping anything else I have ever tried to except maybe Xanax. I am so happy for all you that it works for. Life is depressing and miserable. Pain meds were the only thing that has helped for pain but I have been on them so long I want to try something else. So sick of people who think pain meds cause the problem. Of course I am on a higher dose than someone who just started. It&#039;s been ten years. I wish cymbalta helped as much as you guys."
