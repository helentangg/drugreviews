"I&#039;ve been on Zoloft for the past four months and it&#039;s worked great! I&#039;d been on 3 other medications before that and none of them have worked as well as Zoloft when it&#039;s coupled with 15mg of Buspar and 20mg of Adderall. My anxiety has dropped, my mood has improved dramatically, and I&#039;ve even lost weight, which I haven&#039;t been able to do since I recovered from my eating disorder. Unfortunately I think I&#039;m going to have to have my dosage upped because of my Seasonal Affective Disorder, but otherwise it&#039;s worked very well."
