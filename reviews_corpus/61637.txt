"Been on it for three years now after what seems a lifetime of swings into depression and out. This drug has stopped that and keeps me on a level that helps me to function. Previously 40mg now 20mg is good for me. The reduced dose also helps my libido as the higher stopped me being able to ejaculate. So alls good now. Though my gp thinks now I&#039;m cured I should stop the medication altogether. I think if I do I will experience the return of my ups and horrid downs"
