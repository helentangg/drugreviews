"I was put on this about a year ago (20mg) and I thought it was helping pretty good for my anxiety but like 3 months into it I was noticing some weight gain. Then about 6 months the weight gain has gotten worse and I gained about a good 40 pounds and I felt as if I was never full anymore and I was constantly hungry even a few minutes after I would eat a full meal. I am weening off of it now and in the process of trying Lorazapam (ativan) so we&#039;ll see how that works. Other than that I would recommend at least try this since everyone might not experience weigh gain and excessive hunger like I did."
