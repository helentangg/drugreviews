"Escitalopram Orion 20mg

I have issues with my vision, muscle ache, lack of energy, tiredness, excessive yawning, severe nightmares, dry mouth, itching and a rash together with a worsening of my eczema and a foul temper

The nightmares are the worse.  I fall into a sleep so light but packed with nightmares that would revive Steven Kings writing career. Worse?  I can&#039;t escape them, they wake me but on returning to sleep they continue.  I have gained a little weight but I&#039;m too tired to cook for myself most days

I&#039;m not one for googling &#039;side effects&#039; of drugs but I am glad I have found this site.  I now realise I seriously have to speak to my doctor about switching away from this medication."
