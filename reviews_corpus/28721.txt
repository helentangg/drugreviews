"I am 43 years old and after my son left for college 6 yrs. Ago my life felt like it was spinning out of control. I was so sad. Then my daughter left for college (my last) and I knew I needed help. I had anxiety and sadness each day and I let it go on for way to long because I thought those feelings were normal and I would eventually pop out of it. I was wrong. I went to my gynecologist 3 months ago and cried the whole visit. She prescribed 10 mg of Lexapro and I cannot begin to tell you how much I feel like me again. Only side effects were headache and dizzy. I cut to 5 mg for first week and now 10. Love it! Don&#039;t be afraid to talk to your doctor."
