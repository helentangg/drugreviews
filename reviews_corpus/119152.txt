"I remember reading people&#039;s opinions, online, of the drug before I took it and it scared me away from it. Then I finally decided to give it a try and it has been the best choice I have made. I have been on it for over 4 months and I feel great. I&#039;m on 100mg and I don&#039;t have any side effects. When I first started I did notice that my hands would tremble but then it subsided. So honestly, don&#039;t listen to all the negativity because what doesn&#039;t work for some works amazing for others. So go based on youself and not everyone else. It may be a blessing in diguise. The pill is not meant to make you be all happy go lucky and see &quot;butterflies and roses&quot;, its meant to help put the chemicals in your mind in balance so you can just be who you are and not overly depressed. I still get sad some times, but that is normal, that is life, and it&#039;s up to people to take control to make a change. I did so by getting on this pill."
