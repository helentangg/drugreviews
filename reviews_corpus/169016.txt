"I have been on every medicine for bipolar/depression, anxiety you can name. I was on Effexeor for 7 years it worked for the first 2 years but lost it&#039;s effect, but the doctors had to keep me on it due to the fact very time they tired to ween me off, I&#039;d experienced terrible withdrawals. I&#039;ve finally been able to get off of Effexor, this time with little to no withdrawal effects. The doctor put me on Viibryd and I was very doubtful, but I&#039;m happy to say that after only using for a week, I feel better than I ever have! None of the other medicines made me feel this good, including when the Effexor was working. I&#039;m no longer irritable, and my sexual drive is slowly coming back. Thanks to the maker&#039;s of Viibryd."
