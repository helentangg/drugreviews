"I like this med! I had severe anxiety and moderate depression. . I&#039;m only on 5 mg to start but in 2-3 weeks I noticed a big change in balance, mood, less anxiety and depression. I&#039;m still a little depressed and would like to go up to 10 mg. Perhaps 25-30 mg is too much but in smaller doses, gradually increased, is greatly changing my quality of life. PS Take in the morning. I wish you all well."
