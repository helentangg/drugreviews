"Pristiq is the only anti depressant I&#039;ve ever tried.
26. Recovering bulimic.
Anxiety/depression.
I put off taking AD&#039;s for years and tried everything but...but couldn&#039;t stop throwing up my food due to bouts of anxiety and sadness.
Pristiq is working for me and I now have my life back. I am so happy now.
Normal weight and attitude towards myself and food.
This saved me.

Miss a tablet and it causes dizzyness and nausea. Also hot and cold flushes if you go nearly 48hrs without it.
Super lightweight on alchohol and makes hangovers worse.
But I didn&#039;t expect this drug to work for me at all. I thought I would live with an ED for the rest of my life and that it would be a struggle.
Not anymore.
