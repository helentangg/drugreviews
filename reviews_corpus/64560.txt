"Okay first of all! It will work! You need to give it time. Don&#039;t search up how long it will work that gives you more anxiety! Mine took a while to work. I was originally on 50mg and my appetite was getting better. But after 3 weeks my sleep still wasn&#039;t better and I had to up my dose to 100mg. I am starting to sleep normally again after taking this for 6 weeks! I really do fully feel like my self and I&#039;m not waking up with panic anymore. It makes you feel so good to the point that you feel so normal that you&#039;ll be wondering if you don&#039;t need to take it anymore. I fortunately only get anxiety because I&#039;m in school. So I hope to taper off of it after I&#039;m done with school!"
