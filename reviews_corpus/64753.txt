"I developed Postpartum OCD. My OB prescribed 50mg until I could get in to see a psychiatrist. The first five days I was antsy and weird. I couldn&#039;t sleep. Definitely it increased my anxiety. On the sixth day I had several hours with almost no obsessive thoughts. I was like, holy crap, this might be working. After two weeks I was feeling like 80% better 80% of the time. I increased to 75mg and that increase seemed to help a bit more. It also started to make me sleepy. Didn&#039;t see the point in going any higher. Two months in now. Lost weight. It&#039;s not like I never have obsessive thoughts, but most of the time I feel fine, and that gives me a solid basis from which to continue CBT and ERP."
