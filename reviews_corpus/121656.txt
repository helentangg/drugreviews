"I also suffer from EUPD (BPD), Anxiety, Anorexia Nervosa, 
Although I have only been on these for a month, I feel a huge difference. I , for once, actually feel like I can get better, and I am getting better. I can laugh, I can think clearly, I can breathe again.

However, I get very nauseous on these, and it seems only eating cures that, which is out of the question for me at the moment."
