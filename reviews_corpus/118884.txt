"Long story short, I&#039;ve had panic/anxiety disorder for about 4 or 5 years. Lots of things has happened through my experience... I&#039;ve taken it all, Klonopin, Xanax, Ativan, Buspar, Trazodone. Zoloft is the only thing that works for me without upping the dosage every month then having withdrawals. 

I&#039;ve been on Zoloft (50 MG once a day) for about 7 months, and it just works. Other anxiety medications work, but they&#039;re not meant for daily use. Zoloft is an everyday medication that makes me smile and proud of what I&#039;ve been through."
