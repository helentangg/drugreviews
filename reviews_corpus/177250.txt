"I am a 59 year old male with non-diabetic nerve pain due to several bad disks. I was prescribed Gabapentin, which worked very well, unfortunately after about 13 mo, I developed an allergy to it, so my Dr prescribed Cymbalta, 30 mg 2x/ day and it has worked quite well also. The only side effect I have experienced is a bit of tiredness and sleeping more than before, but I have always been a poor sleeper, so this has been a bonus!

During my annual checkup last week, my doctor suggested I try to go off Cymbalta to see if the nerve pain has improved. I was told to cut my evening dose for a week, then begin taking one pill every other day for a week, and so on. At one pill every other day, my foot pain has returned I can&#039;t sleep my head is literally spinning!!"
