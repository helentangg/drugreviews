"2 years of living with physical symptoms such as nausea, headaches, dry mouth.. Not knowing what it was.. I was at the doctors almost every week getting every test imaginable! 
Changed doctors about 12 times... Finally one suggests that I might have Anxiety. 7 weeks of seeing a psychologist, didn&#039;t help! 
On my first week of 5mg, and then up to 10mg next week... So far so good! Not really any symptoms, so I&#039;m liking it!"
