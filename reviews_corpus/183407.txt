"I have been taking Cymbalta for the second time after going off it cold turkey 5 months previous (wouldn&#039;t recommend it). I have found in the last week feeling very hyped up again the depression is not as bad but the hyped up feeling is becoming hard to control. I&#039;m on the 30 mg only sexual disinterest and constant feeling of wanting to go the toilet are a little frustrating."
