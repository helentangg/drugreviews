"I was prescribed 50mg pristiq for anxiety and panic attacks after I became tolerant to zoloft a couple months ago. Pristiq definitely eased the anxiety and I&#039;ve had only a few panic attacks since I&#039;ve been taking them. I&#039;ve been wanting to try coming off any medication as Im only 18 and really want to be able to function without the help of an anti-depressant. Within one day of stopping I was extremely nauseous to the point of being sick, had a fuzzy and dizzy head, a migraine, faint spells, hot and cold temperature, flu symptoms and I could NOT stop crying I felt so hopeless. So basically this medicine worked for my anxiety but the withdrawal symptoms are pretty extreme. Make sure your on holidays from work or school before you stop them."
