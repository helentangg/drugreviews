"I have been on 20mg for four weeks so far. I am not really sure how I should be feeling. I went for recheck yesterday to see if any improvement. Since I&#039;ve only had one cycle since it&#039;s hard to tell if working. Asked my husband to monitor my moods this month with me to see if it&#039;s working. Did anyone else take this long to kick in? My dr said by week 2 I would have noticed."
