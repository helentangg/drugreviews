"I&#039;ve taken Zoloft off and on for depression and OCD for the past 10 years and have experienced few side effects. I am now taking 100 mg and am fine continuing on it for the rest of my life, though perhaps I&#039;ll go down to 50 mg at some point. It&#039;s been a real life-saver for me; I am rarely down and still feel very much myself. Also, it hasn&#039;t led to any weight gain. In all, am very satisfied."
