"I&#039;m only on 2.5 my along with Celexa. I&#039;ve had weird, disjointed dreams but they don&#039;t bother me much. No nausea as many people have seen. But I have had an increase in energy but it comes at a price...I feel like every muscle is tight. I&#039;ve also experienced painful gas bubbles &amp; a pinching in my chest &amp; a feeling like my heart is pounding but my BP &amp; pulse are fine.  I&#039;ve also been breaking out on my face.  Even with the side effects it&#039;s made enough of a difference (3 years in a severe depression including suicide attempt) that I&#039;ll put up with them to feel this good."
