"TERRIBLE!! It has been 4 weeks and I have been experiencing Insomnia. I tried every Naturalpathic remedy and method that one can think of; EFT, Meditation, Hops, Chamamille, on and on and on... Nothing worked.. So, I broke down, went to the doctor and he gave me this medicine. I told him that I lay there and think - Nothing Negative, I am a happy person, but just lay there thinking about stuff. This medicine made me CRAZY; I was pacing and angry and pulling my hair (metaphorically speaking).   It is a Psychotropic drug - NASTY STUFF! So, as I sit here ANGRY at the doctor for giving me a psychotropic instead of a sleep aid, I am getting more and more irritable....  IN THE TRASH IT GOES!"
