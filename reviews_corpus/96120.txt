"All I can say is don&#039;t give up - the dosage might not be right! I was on this for 2 months at 100mgs for 2 months  without any visible difference.  The doctor suggested I double the dose which I resisted doing, but when I did I felt better almost immediately and have been fine for 8 months now despite a challenging few months. The dosage makes all the difference. Some people are better on low doses, other, like me, do better on a high dose."
