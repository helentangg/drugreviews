"I have had major depression for 10 years.  I had been on handfuls of different antidepressant medicines and found that not one worked.  I had also had suicidal feelings.  My doctor put me on Viibryd and I am a totally different person.  Aside from having diarrhea, which I can totally live with, this medication has changed my life.  I no longer feel depressed.  I have a new love of life, I am not short tempered with my family.  I feel extremely good, and have patience, which I haven&#039;t had in years.  Thank God for Viibryd.  I have been getting samples from the doctor, so I hope that I can afford to keep taking it.  It has made a HUGE difference in my life."
