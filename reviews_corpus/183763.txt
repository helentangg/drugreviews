"I have been on this for one month. I have progressed up in dosage very quickly due to my lack of control over my depression. I started at 30 mg per day and since my doctor participates in clinical trials, he&#039;s aware of how far he can progress with this medication. I am now on 120mg per day, just after a month. It&#039;s given me more energy, less appetite, no weight gain. I feel like I can live my life and cope. I temporarily taking it with Klonopin, but hope to be just on Cymbalta soon."
