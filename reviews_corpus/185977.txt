"I&#039;ve tried many different medications over the years, and Pristiq has been the only one that I can seem to tolerate. I started on sample packs at 50 mg for a few months, and it was actually working, until my doctor&#039;s office conveniently ran out. I was forced to go on Effexor, and though it may be a similar drug, it is absolutely NOT the same. I felt shaky, agitated, and suicidal thoughts also came back while on it. 

Now finally back on Pristiq, and after two days, my anxiety/depression is almost completely gone. It&#039;s like some sort of &quot;switch&quot; went off in my brain. I don&#039;t feel desperate and I&#039;m not texting someone 20 thousand times per day because I feel so suicidal and needy. I am a trashy mess without this drug."
