"I am 23 years old and have been on Lexapro for 7 months for anxiety. I decided to come write a review because I remember when I was first prescribed Lexapro I was in a bit of a panic. I didn&#039;t know rather or not to take it and looked for as much information as I could. Most of the review I read were negative but I was in such a bad place that I chose to still give it a try. So, I want there to actually be a good review out there for people to see and read. I can say that Lexapro changed my life. My extreme anxiety is gone. I sleep normally and I feel like a new person. The only complaints I have, is that I am always tired and it KILLED my sex drive. Love it."
