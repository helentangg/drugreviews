"My doctor gave me Lexapro 5 mg for depression and anxiety.  Shortly after my first dose I felt nothing but side effects and no benefit.  Side effects were extreme restlessness, tired, constant yawning and insomnia, so I stopped immediately.  I then thought that maybe 5 mg was too much so I split that in half totaling 2.5 mg. and this worked perfectly.

I suffered from moderate to severe depression, extreme fatigue, crying spells especially in the morning, no motivation, negative and pessimistic, etc.  Lexapro at 2.5mg gave me instant relief and energy.  I&#039;m a firm believer in starting at the lowest possible dose and see how you go from there.  If side effects outweigh the benefits, try a lower dose."
