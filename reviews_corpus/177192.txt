"Only been on this for a few days for menopause symptoms &amp; it is brutal.
My doctor told me to take it at night as it may cause drowsiness but it kept me awake all night.
The hot flushes were more frequent &amp; worse &amp; I&#039;d nausea &amp; diarrhea.
And made me very anxious, something I never had in my life.
I&#039;d advise extreme caution using this drug &amp; it also meant to be extremely hard to wean off from."
