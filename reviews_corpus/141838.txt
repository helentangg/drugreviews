"Was put on 10mg Lexapro for general anxiety.  I was on it for 5 days and just had to stop. Horrible anxiety, feelings of depression I have never had before, absolutely no appetite, migraine, bad dreams, falling asleep at work while getting more than enough sleep at night, forgetful in my everyday tasks, overall hazy and strange feeling.  Will go back to Ativan and will never take an SSRI for my anxiety again-not worth it."
