"I have been taking Cymbalta (60 mg) for 7 weeks and it has been of great help with the anxiety, depression and chronic abdominal pain. I have some minor nausea and fatigue most days but nothing really bad.  The most serious side effects I have is the sexual one - lost libido and inability to reach orgasm. After 7 weeks I fear it will be a permanent side effect, which is hard to deal with. Thank you."
