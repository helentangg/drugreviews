"I started taking Cymbalta about 4 years ago for severe body pain, I have had two  back surgeries, two knee surgeries, I have fibromyalgia and arthritis. The medication Cymbalta has improved my quality of life a lot. Mostly my  fibromyalgia pain . I hadn&#039;t been able to sleep at night because of my all over body pain however since taking Cymbalta I have had much relief. I take it at night about an hour before bedtime, I take it along with Amtriptyline which helps me to sleep at night pain free. Only one side effect that. I have notice and that is it seems to take your sex drive, when interacting in sexual activity, it&#039;s like you don&#039;t feel anything, a lot of the time,  and that can be a BIG problem for some people. You have to weigh up your options"
