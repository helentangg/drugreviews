"Helps with depression but my doc has had to increase my dose to keep up with my depression.  I guess I get used to the drug &amp; need more.  Huge weight gain -- 18 pounds over 2 months after the last increase to 120 mg.  but I guess I&#039;d rather be plump than crying depressed forever.  Zero libido but that might be my age (65).   I hope I can decrease the dosage as I learn to cope with specific life events largely related to my Dad&#039;s death and my mother in a nursing home (nightmare).   No help with anxiety &amp; doc prescribed Xanax for that.  No difference in back pain.  In summary: helps depression, but I gained weight &amp; lost interest in sex &amp; other things.  Does not help pain and does nothing for my anxiety."
