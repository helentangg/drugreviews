"The only drug that has been effective in treating my anxiety that isn&#039;t a benzo (Klonopin Xanex etc) has been Paxil CR, which reaches full efficacy within a week. Problem with the benzos that is it only lasts for a few months before I start going even more nuts than before, and the withdrawal makes me borderline suicidal. I told my primary I wanted to try something new and she prescribed the lexapro. After one week on 5mg anxiety symptoms are reduced greatly and I&#039;m willing to try 10mg to see if they are eliminated completely but will wait out the full efficacy period before asking. No side effects (huge improvement over Paxil jitters) besides reduced libido (which I&#039;m ok with)."
