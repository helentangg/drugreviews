"I suffered from debilitating IBS and was on the brink of having to leave my job on disability as a result. I also had developed severe anxiety.  After over a year and many trips to a gastro, I went to a psychiatrist to treat my IBS induced anxiety who prescribed nortriptyline. It was a life saver. I have been on it for 2 years and am completely symptom free. Truly a miracle drug for me.  

Only reason for a 9 -- on the two occasions when I forgot to take the medicine I felt very sick.  Must be taken EVERY day."
