"I started on this after trying most of the SSRI&#039;s and Mirtazapine. Only the Mirtazapine worked for my mood but I had horrific side effects with it so doctor suggested Venlafaxine. I started on 37.5mg twice a day and got quite bad nausea for about a week. After that had gone it was great. My mood dropped a bit from being happy on Mirtazapine to being on such a low dose of Venlafaxine but now I&#039;m on 150mg a day it seems to be improving again. I&#039;m very careful not to miss a dose though from what I&#039;ve read about the withdrawal symptoms. This should be a long term medication for me as it works and I&#039;ve got no long term side effects."
