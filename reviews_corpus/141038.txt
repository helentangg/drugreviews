"To anyone taking Lexapro or any antidepressant:  DO NOT believe all the negative reviews you read here or elsewhere.  Do not let them scare you away from taking one of these drugs.  The drugs are not miracle workers, but they do help some by taking the edge off and by not letting you obsess on your feelings and thoughts.  You have to give them time, at least SIX WEEKS. If no improvement, up the dose per your Dr&#039;s permission or switch to another. The side effects are mild, and that is despite what anyone says to the contrary.  Antidepressants work best in combination with psychotherapy, but they are also effective when taken by themselves.  You will eventually feel better."
