"I was pretty bad before taking this medication. I was depressed and socially anxious, I would even dissociate. After taking it initially I felt &quot;lighter&quot;. After couple of weeks slowly I got better and better. I got a job, was not afraid of people and was feeling happy. Side effects were getting fat(at the end of the treatment) and insomnia (at the beginning of the treatment but it went away after a week or so). Another downside was that I was still anxious under the surface but having in mind how bad I was before that it was a miracle. After stopping it the symptoms of SAD came back. Currently on no meds and with social anxiety. Took it for 6 months. It got me out of hell."
