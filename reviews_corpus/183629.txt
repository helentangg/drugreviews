"I took one 30mg pill, for mild depression.  Within four hours I was experiencing serotonin syndrome.  I didn&#039;t know what that was, so I thought if I could just wait for the drug to leave my system I would be fine.  Serotonin syndrome can be fatal if left untreated.  My husband and I waited a week, but I could not function on any level and had constant thoughts of suicide.  I ended up almost being committed to a mental hospital.  I was told that the serotonin syndrome would get better in about a week.  It has been 6 months so far and even with anti-anxiety drugs my life is still difficult. Please be very cautious before trying this drug."
