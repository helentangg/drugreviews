"Asking my doctor about Zoloft was one of the best decisions for me. I have suffered from anxiety as long as I can remember. I feel like a new person now. I didn&#039;t even fully realize how bad it was until taking Zoloft. I didn&#039;t want to take meds, I thought my anxiety was just part of who I was and something I would have to deal with forever. Zoloft has changed my life."
