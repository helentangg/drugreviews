"I&#039;ve had wonderful results on this medication. A few minor side effects that pale in comparison to my improved mood, renewed energy, mellowness and more. I was weaned off Paxil for rapid weight gain, and on  Viibyrd I am losing weight and feeling much more confident and positive. I do have vivid dreams, but honestly, I think that&#039;s fun."
