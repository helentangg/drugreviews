"I was put on Prozac after 3 months of Cymbalta failed to have an affect, and a brief and terrifying experience with Geodon. At first it pretty much numbed all of my emotions up, which, after feeling completely crazy on Geodon, was a very welcome experience. Eventually this neutral state of mind began to even out after about 9 months, and I was finally able to start enjoying life again. After two years, I was able to stop taking medication completely. This pill saved my life."
