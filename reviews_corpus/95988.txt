"After a heat stroke, I would have random, uncontrollable cry spells- sometimes for hours.  Also developed horrible anxiety.  I always had knots in my stomach, and sometimes in public I would suffer &quot;fight or flight.&quot;  It was just exhausting.  I tried Celexa 20 mg, and that made me cry MORE. So, a few months later I tried Zoloft. On 50 mg and it&#039;s been only 6 days. I feel more at ease, better when I wake up, and sleep better! Easier to go to work. Have the courage to try this, it seems like it is turning my life around for the better! Only side effect I have had is diarrhea but it it is a small price to pay for happiness, trust me."
