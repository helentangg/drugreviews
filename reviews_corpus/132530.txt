"Tried this pill last night. Did sleep pretty well but very hungover in the morning. It is just not worth it. Can&#039;t function normally today. I was taking Ativan which was great but the doctor will not prescribe it any more.
Can&#039;t believe that one little pill can make me feel so awful. I will never take it again!!"
