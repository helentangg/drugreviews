"Viibryd has been an effective medicine for me. I&#039;ve never been on a anti-depressant before and was a bit weary of being on one for my newly diagnosed depression. Thanks to my doctor he told me how to take this properly to avoid negative issues and have success.  I started 10mg for 2 weeks and 20mg the next to weeks. I did have stomach issues but he told me I would because of a chemical called serotonin that is made in the stomach but travels to the nervous system to regulate my mood &quot;strange&quot;  therefore I would feel gassy but did go away after a week my body adjusting. Also strange was despite gassy feeling I was out with friends who I surprised with my presence at another friends party.  It felt good to be out!  I am staying on 20mg."
