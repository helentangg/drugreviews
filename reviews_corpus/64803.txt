"Well, I have been depressed the most of my life. Not like I couldn&#039;t function, but just depressed like a normal state of mind. In 2011 I was on Mirtzapine and in this year, my world changed. I started m own business and I builded my own cooperation. Stress got me. I couldn&#039;t sleep without Zopiclone or Zolpidem to aid me. Stress leaded to anxiety and depression. My doctor prescribed several benzodiazepines and allmost got addicted to these. One day he said: &quot;This is medicine for anxiety (Sertraline). Take these. It&#039;ll help you. The first two weeks (today) was unbearable with headache, rapid heart beats, strange thoughts, feeeling nausee, cold/warm-experinces, and I almost gave up. So glad I didn&#039;t, I am balanced, my thoughts are clear."
