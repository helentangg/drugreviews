"Within 3 weeks of taking this medication I found a significant difference it my mood.  I felt overall happier and more at peace like I remember my best self!  Before I had trouble with not being happy or excited about anything (other than sex).  There were sexual side effects for the first month.  The medication has evened out and it no longer affects this aspect.  I have noticed that I get bad headaches every month or so.  I&#039;m not sure if this is part of the medicines side effect or another issue.  I would definitely suggest giving it a try to ease depression and general anxiety.  It hasn&#039;t helped my energy level, but I am able to work out or run and I normally would.  I have been taking the medication for 2 months at a 30 mg dose."
