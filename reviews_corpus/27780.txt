"I ended up on Escitalopram about 2-3 years ago because the previous med (Effexor XR) was causing steady weight gain I just couldn&#039;t manage anymore (50+ lbs. in 9 months). And this has hands down been the best med I&#039;ve ever been on. It doesn&#039;t seem to affect my weight at all, and I feel completely &quot;normal&quot; for possibly the first time since childhood (about 30 years ago). I&#039;m on 20mg, as 10mg just wasn&#039;t quite cutting it, and my doctor also later added Buspirone to help with some lingering anxiety. I found Effexor to be generally more effective for anxiety, and Lexapro more effective for Depression, so I think this Escitalopram/Buspirone combo works well for me."
