"I suffered terrible depression and anxiety after I had my son. It was the worst experience because I had no control over the worrying, sadness and hopelessness. I wasn&#039;t able to enjoy my newborn because I felt so down and anxious about everything. After I developed insomnia and would sleep for 3 days at a time I decided to get help. I felt embarrassed and shameful for feeling this way, but I can assure anyone dealing with postpartum anxiety/depression that it&#039;s NOT your fault! It&#039;s a very real disorder and can take a person&#039;s life if they don&#039;t seem help. Zoloft literally saved mine, I have been on 100mgs for one year and feel like the happy person I was before pregnancy. Best decision I&#039;ve ever made!!"
