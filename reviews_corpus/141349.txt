"After a couple weeks I felt no change either positive or negative.  After a month to 2 months I felt somewhat better.  After 3-4 months I felt better than I had in a very long time.  Life changing better.  But now after 5-6 months my brain feels very foggy and I feel very emotionally numb.  I can&#039;t feel any negative emotions at all which can actually be very frustrating and confusing.  Don&#039;t want to change medication as it has helped so much with mood so I&#039;m hoping the numbness will subside...And may be willing to tough it out since feeling numb is better than feeling depressed."
