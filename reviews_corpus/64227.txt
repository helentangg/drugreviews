"I have been suffering from anxiety and stress since 2013, xanax was suggested to me, 4 years on xanax..5mg thrice a day but even then I was anxious. I decided to consult psychiatrist for complete treatments, he prescribed Zoloft 25mg BD for a week then 50mg OD, on day 7 i started feeling good, on 8 day I have started to take 50mg feeling little foggy but it will obviously show its full effect up to week 4. So give the zoloft time to work...
Wish u all the best.."
