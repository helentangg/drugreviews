"I experienced chronic pain for 4 years, I had difficulty sleeping, would go to work, come home and go to bed. Every time I physically exerted myself, taking a shower, preparing a meal, doing household chores, I would need to go lay down. My family would visit me in my bedroom, it was depressing. 
Cymbalta has changed my life. I can tolerate the cold, even the grocery store used to bother me. I am much more active and find myself only going to bed when it is time for sleep, I also sleep much better. My family has noticed  a huge change in me, as far as being a part of life again.
This is not without cost..I have the strangest dreams, +30lbs, tired, terribly constipated."
