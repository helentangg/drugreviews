"I have had cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) for 15 years or so. CVS started when I was about 18-19 years old. 
I have been &quot;sick&quot; at least 2 days per week, this whole time, sometimes 7 days per week I&#039;m sick, but never just 1 day. ER visits, IV meds, week long hospital stays, and doctors literally worldwide scratching there heads trying to figure out what was wrong with me. I settled into the fact that I was destined to be sick and that it was going to kill me. 
At 33, I FINALLY got the diagnosis of CVS and have been prescribed 50mg amitriptyline, and I have slowly been improving. I have gained weight, and sleep 10hrs nightly, only side effects so far, so I&#039;ll take it! Been 6 months,I&#039;m down to 4-6 sick days per month, so it&#039;s working!"
