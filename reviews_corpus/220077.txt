"Diagnosed with depression/anxiety 10 years ago. Have practically been on every SSRI, SNRI, Seroquel, ALL kinds of benzos (do NOT recommend- highly addictive!)  I felt so frustrated that none of the anti-depressants were working for me and avoided tricyclics for fear of weight gain. Last week I finally realised that I need serious help as I was planning suicide. I&#039;m back on 100mg endep and 25mg Seroquel if needed at night. I sleep fantastic, wake up feeling so refreshed. Sleeping makes a HUGE difference, and the funny thing is now that I&#039;m feeling good, I&#039;m out of bed and exercising. I know it&#039;s scary to think about weight gain but it really is different for everyone and it&#039;s worth a shot! Endep&#039;s been the only one for me. Good luck!"
