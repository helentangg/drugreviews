"After holding on to the medication for about 3 weeks I couldn&#039;t believe the results after just one day and literally felt the effects hours after I took the medication. I did experience side effects far as the nausea, diarrhea, headache and dizziness but I found out after taking it the second day that it was only because I hadn&#039;t eaten before Celexa. I really see the difference I&#039;m no longer stressed and depressed I do feel the difference and it&#039;s a really great medication. I was so iffy about taking depression anxiety medication however I&#039;m so glad that I did."
