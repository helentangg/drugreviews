"I was prescribed Prozac last year for depression and OCD. The first three days taking it were hard for me. My depression worsened and I was having terrifying nightmares every night. I went back to my doctor, explained to him how I was feeling and I was immediately taken off and switched to something else. Everyone reacts differently to different medications, but make sure you tell your doctor if your depression worsens or you feel more anxious or have nightmares.. The nightmares every single night was what made my doctor know that Prozac wasn&#039;t for me.. Even if it&#039;s supposed to take 2-3 weeks, or however many, to kick in, make sure you tell your doctor you&#039;re not feeling well!! Let them decide what the best decision is for you. :)"
