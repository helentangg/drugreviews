"Celexa has turned my life completely around. I have always worried excessively about everything. I couldn&#039;t enjoy things because I worried about every little detail that could go wrong! I have been on Celexa for 4 years and I wish I had known about it long, long ago. I enjoy everything in my life and only worry if its a life or death matter. I take 20 mg a day."
