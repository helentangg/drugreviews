"Been on it for apprx 20 yrs for Gad which results in episodes of depression. Works better than first 2 drugs incl Paxil. If your anxiety is really bad like mine - you just live with side effects. Tried to go off few yrs ago - ok for few months then panic anxiety attacks - so back on med. Mostly on 10mg but range 5-20. Generic version avail in Canada - very affordable."
