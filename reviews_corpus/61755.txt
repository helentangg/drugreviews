"I&#039;ve taken 20mg of citalopram for a little over two years and while it has helped ease my depression and anxiety symptoms, I&#039;m not sure the benefits have outweighed the issues. My mood has improved overall and I have far fewer panic attacks than I used to, but I definitely have weeks where I feel absolutely terrible again and its effectiveness seems to have worn off over time. The biggest problem I&#039;ve had is that it&#039;s caused issues with my attention span and I my head feels foggy much of the time. My doctor suggested cutting the pills in half and that seems to be helping, but because of the haziness I am really considering a change in medication."
