"This medication does come with its somewhat unpleasant side effects, but I have to say that I am happy. I am finally hopeful. For weeks I was so down, feeling weighed down by negative thoughts and feelings of hopelessness. It got to a point where I couldn&#039;t even concentrate at work. I was crying under my desk. Two weeks after taking Lexapro, I feel alive again. Doesn&#039;t mean I don&#039;t occasionally feel sad, but I don&#039;t have the pain in my chest, that heavy feeling that came with being depressed. I have the will to do things now. Nevertheless, it does make me a little jittery, especially after coffee! I&#039;m on 10mg, I tried cutting the pill in half today, but still feel hyperactive. Will consult with my doctor but small price to pay for happiness."
