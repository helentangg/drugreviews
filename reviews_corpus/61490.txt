"This has saved my life. I wasn&#039;t able to go to work or out because of intense panic attacks. I was hopeless. The medicine started working for me in a few days. The beginning side affects were bad though. Prepare to take it easy the first few days. I haven&#039;t had a panic attack in along time now ( compared to at least one a day). I am able to do things daily now without anxiety. I have nothing bad to say about this pill. I want to thank the creators of this medicine because it has improved my life tremendously!!"
