"Tried this medicine for the first time about 4 days ago. After been on clonazepam
My doctor thought zoloft 100mg  would be good for me. And ooooo boy when i tell you it made me feel my anxiety to the 10th power. I was all emotional couldn&#039;t sleep or eat then my chest felt like i had bricks seating there. All i can say is my experience with zoloft was not fun at all. Im still trying to recover from that one pill i took."
