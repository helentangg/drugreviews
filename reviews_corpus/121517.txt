"Hi everyone, 

I have suffered with mild depression, severe anxiety and social phobia for 2 years. I&#039;ve tried eating healthy, excercising regularly, staying away from alcohol and taking herbal remedies. This has helped hugely and I have been a lot better. But I do still suffer from anxiety and I worry all the time like my head is going 100mph. I also can&#039;t cope with more then a couple of things and get stressed easily. My doctor prescribed me venlafaxine 75mg XL. Day 1 I had loss of appetite and dry mouth. That went after the 2nd day. The only side effect I&#039;m really having is extreme fatigue I have been sleeping all week. I&#039;m now on day 6. I&#039;ve woke up better no side effects just no motivation what so ever &amp; I feel emotionless will this go?"
