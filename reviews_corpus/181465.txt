"I would not be alive today if not for Prozac.  I was throwing up 5 times a day and so desperately unhappy I often thought of suicide.  I escaped an abusive childhood only to move on to the living hell that is bulimia.  Within two weeks of Prozac my all consuming thoughts about food, weight &amp; throwing up diminished and I started focusing on my future, college and doing something other than throwing up all day. I weaned myself off of it after about 2 years of being bulimia free. I was bulimic for 13 years and haven&#039;t thrown up now in 15 years (except for the flu). Please try it for bulimia, no negative side effects that I remember."
