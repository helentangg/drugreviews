"I started taking Celexa 3 months ago for social anxiety and depression. I&#039;ve had depression since I was 7 and my parents were against me taking medication. My sophmore year of college my anxiety started controlling my life to the point that I never left my home to be with people and I wouldn&#039;t participate in anything where anyone would watch me or evaluate me. I finally got my mom to agree to take me to the Doctor and get some medicine. It&#039;s been 3 months and my life has completely changed. I go out to social events, I&#039;ve learned how to make friends and I&#039;m doing great in school. This medication has changed my life significantly. The only problem I&#039;ve experienced is that it makes me tired, but it&#039;s worth it."
