"I avoided this medication because of fear of the side effects reported, especially nausea. However have been taking for about 10 days now at 10mg with no serious side effects and no noticeable nausea yet. Definitely for me the AD that interferes least with concentration. We all react differently to these medications but I have been pleasantly surprised so far."
