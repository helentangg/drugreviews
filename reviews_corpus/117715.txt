"I started taking nortriptyline to prevent my headaches and migraines. The first month it seemed to work pretty well and I didn&#039;t have any headaches. But I started feeling depressed (which I never am), extreme irritability and a low to no sex drive.  I stopped taking the medicine after two months and gave myself a 3 month break.  I just started taking them again and all the side effects came racing back!  I would much rather have headaches than deal with the side effects.  The depression feeling is so horrible."
