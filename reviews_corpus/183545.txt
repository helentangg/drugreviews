"Being 32 and having cancer four times, I realized that I had a serious anxiety disorder. I did not believe in a &quot;pill&quot; but eventually, I realized that something had to change. I tried Welbutrin for a while, which made me feel bipolar and then I switched to Lexapro for several years. The problem with Lexapro was that I didn&#039;t feel anything good or bad. I know that you might think that&#039;s a blessing, but it&#039;s truly not. After gaining over 20 pounds, my doctor suggested that I switch to Cymbalta, which I was very nervous about, but I knew something had to change. I have been on Cymbalta for 3 months now and it is working. I think the worst part is the constipation! I also have broken out in several rashes on my face while &quot;drinking.&quot;"
