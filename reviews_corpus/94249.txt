"I switched from Zoloft due to fogginess at higher doses.  As others have mentioned, the nausea and dizziness were definitely difficult for me when I first started Brintellix.  At the same time,  I could tell this was working for my depression.  I was so grateful for the antidepressant effects.  I cut back from 10 mg. to 5 m.g. (half a pill) for a couple of weeks and the nausea began to subside.  I went back up to 10 mg. and now nausea is only an occasional problem.  My doc said to make sure to take it with food, which I do in the morning.  I know others take it at night.  The nausea was indeed difficult, but I am so glad I stuck with it.  For me, it is a very effective antidepressant."
