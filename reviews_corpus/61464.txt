"I got prescribed this medication for mild anxiety &amp; minor depression. I usually get overwhelmed by things that should feel not so worrisome, &amp; replay things that irritate or upset me over &amp; over in my head. I&#039;ve been on a light dose of Celexa for about a week now. I take it at night &amp; don&#039;t have trouble sleeping. I will say right when it hits 645 - 7am I wake up &amp; am immediately wide awake though. I have definitely noticed a positive change. Not a huge one, but just enough to make me feel more &quot;normal&quot;. I can be a bit of a drag sometimes, &amp; just not my peppy self that I know is hiding in me. This has made me feel much more of a positive peppy &quot;good parts of myself&quot; come out more &amp; I can manage my stress better &amp; lighter than I was before."
