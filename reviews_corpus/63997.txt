"I got prescribed in sertraline 25mg in May 2017, and  only I&#039;ve been taken for a week now . This medication ease my worries and stable my mood but every time I take I feel pain in my chest or collarbone also headache and dizziness. Yesterday I went the 2 minutes walk and I was feeling dizziness and not stable on my feet. I was also more anxious and afraid and faint and worried about passing out. The first few days I got headache that&#039;s very strange, not the headache I normally get, but different one and it went away after. Also I was feeling strangle sensation yesterday in my chest and my neck. This morning I woke up strange my both eyes were blurry for just a few seconds and then it went away very quickly. Please tell me if anybody experience  blurry vision .thanks"
