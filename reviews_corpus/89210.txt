"Just got prescribed 10 milligrams,  Thank God I decided to cut it in half just to see how I reacted to it, took it at night. Felt the effects in about a half hour, didn&#039;t sleep to well, felt wierd. Got in the morning to let the dog out and almost hit the floor, very dizzy.  I do feel more relaxed today, and somewhat better. I was told most people don&#039;t even know they are taking it , starts to work in about 4 weeks. Not me must be very sensative to it. I think I will try 5 milligrams again tonight and see how it goes. I will keep you all informed."
