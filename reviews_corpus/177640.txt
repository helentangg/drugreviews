"I swapped from Amitriptyline for chronic pain and sleep issues, to Duloxetine which I was led to believe would help me sleep too. 

After taking for just two days I felt horrid on this, I felt spaced out, and couldn&#039;t sleep. Two weeks in and it has turned me into an insomniac. I also found i had bad headaches, nausea, and it brought on the worst depression I had ever experienced. I was anxious, jittery, feeling very manic. I was told the side effects would wear off, but I felt long term this was not going to help my insomnia one bit. I did find my pain lessened, but the insomnia and mental instability it brought far outweighed any benefit. Now I have been 2 days cold turkey and it has been HELL but I wanted this poison out of me!"
