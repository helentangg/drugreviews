"I have been using Cymbalta for two of years for neuropathic pain in my feet. It works very well most of the time at the 90mg dose I am taking daily. There are days when I have done some activity that aggravates my back and I have to take an extra 30 mg. This helps but I experience the hot flashes at the 120 dose. I do not have the night terrors but there are times when I have run out of the prescription and if I have not had it for a day I get very vivid dreams. They are not scary but if I wake up from one I&#039;m up until I settle my brain down. Erectile Dysfunction has been a problem and I address it with Cialis or Viagra which are expensive even with my coverage. Reducing the dose to 60mg the day before sex helps."
