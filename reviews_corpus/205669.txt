"I&#039;ve been using Pristiq for 6 months now. I have never used any form of medication for anxiety before as I said to myself I never want to be on medication. So I spoke to family, friends and then finally a psychologist to help me with my constant anxiety and negative mind chatter- but nothing helped so I decided to see my doctor for a prescription for an anti-depressant/anti-anxiety type medication. He recommended Pristiq. The first few days I felt a little dizzy, some constipation but that soon passed and in about 2 weeks I was feeling a lot calmer, more level headed and a lot more positive. It has helped me get through a tough time and I would recommend it."
