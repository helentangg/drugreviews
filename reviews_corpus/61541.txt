"Having struggled with crippling anxiety for a while now and after therapy not working, I decided to approach my doctor about meds. He suggested citalopram 20mg. I found this too strong and cut it down to 10mg- much better. After a few weeks, I am sleeping better, eating better and the anxiety is at bay- I was able to give 2 presentations with no issues and my thinking is much clearer now. The only downside is the side effects in the first 2 weeks can be jarring but once they settle down, the results are well worth it"
