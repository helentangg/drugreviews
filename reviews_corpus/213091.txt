"Nardil was a last resort drug for me, after 25 years of trying anything, including a vagus nerve implant and electroconvulsive therapy to treat life-long major depression.  I have never been sure if it works or not.  I still have major depressive episodes - an increase in the medication seems to help.  However, side effects such as fatigue to the point where I cannot take another step, hypomanic episodes, a feeling of &quot;bugs&quot; crawling on under my skin, and an 80 pound weight gain makes me want to stop taking the medication.  I have stopped and restarted it a couple times over the past 6 years, and am unsure if it really helps or not.  If you plan to start taking it, I would advise to keep track of side effects you might not relate to Nardil."
