"I&#039;m taking 60 mg Prozac since 4 weeks. I only relapsed twice in the first week (while being on a lower dose) It took away the urge to binge and even purge. I&#039;m less depressed, too. I&#039;ve been through 5 years of psychoanalysis and 2 hospital stays all to no avail (never took medicines). I have bulimia for over 25 years and am hopeful to get rid of the food pressure - for good. Prozaz changed my life so far. I&#039;ll update at a later time."
