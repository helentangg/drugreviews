"Absolutely fantastic! Been suffering with severe chronic migraines for two years. Tried a handful of different triptans, topiramate and beta blockers (propranolol). Finally tried this and I haven&#039;t had one migraine since starting. It makes you incredibly hungry and I&#039;ve gained a stone in two months. However I&#039;d rather put on extra baggage than suffer everyday from severe pain."
