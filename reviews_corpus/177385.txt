"I have suffered from manic depression and pheripheral neuropathy for years. I have tried every med under the sun and nothing ever worked, until I tried cymbalta. I started on 30 mg and after 1 month increased to 60 mg. I feel as though I&#039;m living my life now and not just existing. I&#039;m not needing to take naps everyday and I have energy once again to do the simple things in life. I feel as though my life isn&#039;t on hold anymore thanks to cymbalta."
