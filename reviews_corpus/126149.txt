"I have tried so many different antidepressants and I never felt right. After 3 months of taking them I would spiral downward and my dose would need to be adjusted. I have been on Viibryd 40mg for 4 weeks now and I feel great.  It has been years since I have felt like my old self again.  I opted for this medicine and to pay out of pocket.  It is worth every penny."
