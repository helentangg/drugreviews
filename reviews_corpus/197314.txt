"I have been going through menopause for over 8 years now.  I have tried everything during that time.  Each medicine worked for a certain time frame, then it was no longer effective.  After reading a research study about the effects of Paxil to ease hot flashes I decided to give it a try.  Paxil knocked the severe flashes out while decreasing the frequency and severity of the flashes that still occur.  Also, Paxil calmed my stress/anxiety which also contributed to the decrease in frequency.  "
