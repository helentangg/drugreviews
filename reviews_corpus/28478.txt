"Had horrible anxiety upon waking up for the first two months.  But it took Lexapro (15mg) 3 months before I got the full effect and am much better now!  Dr also prescribed Seroquel to speed things up.  Give this medicine time, it takes longer than the average 4-6 weeks as stated.  I felt a difference within a few days."
