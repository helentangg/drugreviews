"I am a 27 yr old, 5&#039;5&quot;, 105 lbs female. I started taking escitalopram a month back for my panic attacks due to agoraphobia. At first started with 5 mg a day along with 0.5mg etizolam for 2 weeks which didn&#039;t make any difference. Then my psychiatrist increased the dosage to 10mg a day along with 2.5mg clobazam (Frisium). I can now go out of my house without having a panic attack but a slight anxiety is still there. Once by mistake I took two 10mg tablets (I thought I was taking two 5mg tablets from the older strip) and when I went out that day I didn&#039;t feel even the slightest bit of anxiety. Later I realized I had taken 20mg. It&#039;s been 2 weeks now on the 10mg dosage and no weight gain. In fact I lost 2lbs. Just need to ask for higher dose."
