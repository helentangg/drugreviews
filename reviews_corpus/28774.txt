"I&#039;ve only been on Lexapro (10mg) for 4 days and already I&#039;m a little worried. I am experiencing extreme dizziness and nausea to where I think I&#039;m going to pass out. The good news is I&#039;m not as depressed. The bad news? I&#039;m not exactly happy either. I am a complete zombie. I don&#039;t care about anything. I cannot concentrate. I find myself &quot;zoning out&quot; during the day, like I&#039;ve mentally checked out. The second night I took my medicines I had an anxiety attack as well, and my depression slammed me pretty hard. My suicidal thoughts were worse during the attack and I did some serious damage to myself. I&#039;m sure this works for some people, but I&#039;m going to give it a month and if there is no improvement with these side effects I&#039;m switching."
