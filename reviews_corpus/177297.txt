"Just started Cymbalta at 30 mg one in the am and one in the pm for my Fibromayalgia pain and anxiety and depression. It&#039;s been 8 days and it is helping so much! It did give me nausea and an acidy stomach for 2 days. That went away. I also take Gabepentin 300 mg 4 times a day. 
I came off of Tramadol 50 mg at 6-9 a day. Cymbalta helped with withdrawals for me. I still have pain from my fibro but it is dulled. 
Hope this helps xx"
