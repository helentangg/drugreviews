"This drug has been fantastic,I  have been on and off certain anti depressants most my life (am 32) I would be fine for a while then things would get to much.  My doctors have just put me on a higher dose of this and I am on 300mg a day I feel calmer and can think things through first, but there is a down side..  don&#039;t ever miss one.  Before I was on my higher dose I was at 225mg a day and I missed a day and a half as had forgotten to get more and was waiting for my repeat prescription, thinking this would be ok, oh how wrong I was, it felt like everything was really loud and ppl were shouting as they were talking. I couldn&#039;t concentrate on a conversation one min I wanted to cry. In all a good medicine but don&#039;t miss any."
