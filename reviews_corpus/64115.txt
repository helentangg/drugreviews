"I was originally worried about taking sertraline as my friend had been taking them and suffered really bad side effects. The first few days were rough, I felt very tired, sick and dizzy, much like a bad hangover. But over time I have found sertraline to be really helpful. I no longer wake up in the middle of the night having a panic attack, and when I think about the stresses in my life I no longer obsess and worry over them.
I&#039;m currently on 150mg and they do make me very sleepy after the first few hours of taking them so I find that for me it is best to take them before bed! 

Don&#039;t be scared to try this medication! If you do have any side effects at first don&#039;t be put off, it will get better!!"
