"I have been on Lexapro for about 2  years now for anxiety disorder.  Works great, still have nervous moments but much better than I would be without it.  Only downside is MAJOR fatigue, can barely stay awake during the day.  Going to try switching it so that I take it at night instead of the morning, but if that doesn&#039;t work I&#039;m going to need to change prescriptions."
