"I&#039;ve been using lexapro for about 4 weeks now. The doctor started me out on 5mg and then after 3 weeks rose it to 10mg. She wanted to make sure I wasn&#039;t having any negative side effects. My anxiety was something that was constant. I would have panic attack and on occasion I would purge my food from the anxiety. Today I don&#039;t feel the constant anxiety, haven&#039;t had a panic attack, and haven&#039;t had the urge to purge. I never thought I would wake up everyday and feel as happy and ready to take on the day as I do. I completely recommend this medication and you really do have to take it for a few weeks to notice change. I get it&#039;s not for everyone but it worked for me and I&#039;m forever grateful to be here alive and thrivin&#039;!"
