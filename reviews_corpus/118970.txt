"I have been using Zoloft to treat mainly social anxiety for about 2 1/2 months now. I started off taking the lowest dosage- 25mg. Two weeks later, my psychiatrist doubled it to 50 mg, and four weeks later, he doubled it again to 100 mg, which is where I am at now. The first few days of starting it I felt absolutely miserable, and for those with severe depression, it may very well be debilitating. But I stuck through it! Over time, and still continuing, my moods have become remarkably stable and positive. My insecurities and obsessive negative thoughts, especially ones of a jealous nature, have nearly vanished. Sometimes it&#039;s harder to orgasm now, but my libido is still intact. Zoloft also helped me with me with my vaginismus and irritable bowel syndrome."
