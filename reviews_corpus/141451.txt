"Been on this medication for almost a week. Within the first two days I had stopped having panic attacks, down from around two-three a day. Side effects are minor, at least to me. I get hungry a lot, and sometimes can&#039;t sleep properly, but both of those are essentially the same as how it was before, so I&#039;m used to it."
