"I started Zoloft two days ago. Literally after an hour of taking half of a 100mg tablet I could feel the effects. Everything just felt crisp and bright and I felt alive for the first time in years. I was worried my emotions would be just the same the whole time but I saw a very sad movie this morning and was able to cry, just like I normally would. 

i had mild teeth grinding at night and awoke in the middle of the night and couldn&#039;t sleep for a few hours but other than that i&#039;d recomend zoloft to anyone."
