"50gm sertraline has changed my life. I suffered anxiety and social anxiety for many years. I decided to get help because I was getting married and didn&#039;t want it to be the worst memory of my life.
I&#039;m now confident and not afraid. I can speak up. I enjoy work which is sales and I&#039;ve improved drastically. I&#039;m sweating less and have less nerves. No crazy heart pounding and mind blanking situations and unnecessary awkwardness. I could go on.. Be aware though, the 1st few days are intense.  I couldn&#039;t sleep a wink and my general anxiety was extreme. It was scary. Socially though, somehow I had improved the following day!! And now 2years on there are no side effects. It feels like taking paracetamol. Best decision ever."
