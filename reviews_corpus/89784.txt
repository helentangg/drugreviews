"Celexa was the first medication I was ever put on for mild depression, stress and anxiety mostly stemming from my stressful work environment (prison). I felt no difference with this medication, and I was nauseous as a side effect. Doctor switched me to Wellbutrin, which did not work, and then to Effexor, which is a wonder drug."
