"I&#039;m 21 years old and relatively inexperienced with my anxiety and taking medications for it. For the last two years my anxiety started to have a negative effect on my life. It progressively got worse to the point that I had trouble with everyday activities. I finally went to a doctor and he prescribed Celexa. I&#039;m on 10mg a day and it has been wonderful. Slight side-effects at first like occasional dizziness and unusual sleeping patterns but these were very minimal. After two weeks of being on the medication the side-effects TOTALLY subsided. I have been taking Celexa now for 9 months and have a great life. School performance improved, relationship with friends and family are better than ever, and most importantly I&#039;m happier than ever."
