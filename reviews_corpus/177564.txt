"Cymbalta saved my life from severe anxiety and panic disorder, as well as Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy (intense nerve pain). I am 22 and have been on it for a few years. A year ago, I stopped taking it because I wasn&#039;t sure I still needed it. Within a week, I was living in hell. Crippled by my emetophobia, anxiety, and pain, I couldn&#039;t leave my apartment. I was having up to 10 panic attacks a day, sick to the point of throwing up all the time, stuck in bed. I got back on Cymbalta and in six weeks everything was better again. I can live my life now. Thank you Cymbalta! If I have to be on this med for the rest of my life, that is fine with me."
