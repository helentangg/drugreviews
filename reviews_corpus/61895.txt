"50 year old female here.  About 10 years I have been on this; it really takes the edge off! Much more calming.  Prior, I realized I was slowly becoming my father - irritable, impatient, angry, negative. Little things irritated me.  Felt &#039;rushed&#039; all the time.  Got worse as I hit 40-ish.  Tried a couple of other anti-anxiety/depressants prior to Citalapram (Celexa), but couldn&#039;t handle side effects.  Being on Citalapram (20mg), which didn&#039;t take long to kick in, I did NOT experience any side effects!  And most important (for me), did not reduce my sex drive at all!  Yes, still achieve orgasms!  Tried to wean myself off it a couple times over the years, and went right back to &#039;slowly becoming my father&#039;.  So I am staying on this."
