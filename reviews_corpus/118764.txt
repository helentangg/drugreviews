"I was prescribed Zoloft many years ago and after only taking it once without any instant results I stopped using it. I was on active duty and had been deployed several times by then. Years went by and a new physician urged me to take Zoloft and I used it this time to ease me into a restful night&#039;s sleep. It worked wonderfully and the following day was easy going. I was a little hazy the following day as a side effect and my tummy was griping loudly. I lost weight and am still losing which will have me call the company and back the truck up to my house! No complaints here! I feel mellow but still connected to what is happening. I don&#039;t feel &quot;high.&quot; Each person&#039;s experience will be different for sure and I am hoping for the best results for all."
