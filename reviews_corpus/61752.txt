"I started getting anxiety attacks and my doctor started me off on 10mg of celexa. The first few days, I noticed I had more anxiety and it made me really sleepy and groggy. After a few more days, I noticed it made me not want to get out of bed and lost almost all appetite. I was forcing myself to eat and ended up losing 9lbs in 10 days. By day 10, I couldn&#039;t take it anymore, I knew something wasn&#039;t right and celexa was making it worse and making me feel worse. I went to my doctor and she told me to stop right away, that the side effects shouldnt have lasted that long or made me feel depressed. It didn&#039;t work for me."
