"I have a fear of driving and social anxiety when it comes to standing in line etc. did Zoloft for 2 weeks and thought my life was over. Went and changed my meds to lexapro half a pill every night before bed.i feel like me again. Not a different happy weirdo but the old me. I am now on 10mg and it&#039;s only been a month but I&#039;m so glad how it&#039;s working. A little sweaty but that&#039;s about it . I also take blood pressure meds for my anxiety as needed. Before anyone tries xanaex or lorazepam I highly recommend this medicine. No side effects and non habit forming"
