"I have heardof this drug working well for others. However, I feel compelled to write my experience with this drug. I was given a four week supply of Lexapro by my doctor (10mg pills) because I had panic attacks two days in a row which I did not realize at the time was a result of over drinking. I ended up taking two pills total. The side effects I experienced were: EXTREME anxiety, nausea, headache, chest pains, cold sweats, sleeplessness, nervous energy, and just general mania. I was terrified that this would never go away. The side effects went away the fourth day after taking the second (and last) pill. That was however the worst and longest 4 days of my life. You WILL get through this!"
