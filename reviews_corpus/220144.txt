"I was prescribed Amitriptyline for Odie Sphincter dysfunction, which is a spasm in the Gallbladder sphincter.  The wonderful side affect is my migraines were cured by this as well.
NOTE: The smallest dosage of generic amitriptyline is 10 mg.  I have gotten the dose down to about 1.5 mg by breaking each 10 mg into 8ths.  This has eliminated the constipation I was experiencing at the higher dose, and costs me about $10/year for prescription."
