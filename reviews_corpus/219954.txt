"I believe fibromyalgia symptoms started when I was around 14, it wasn&#039;t diagnosed until I was 41. I  had been to many doctors complaining of lethargy and body pain/aches,  and I never had any answers, one doctor said &quot;do you think this might be all in your head.&quot;My life changed at 41 when I started on amitriptyline, I finally went into a deep sleep, felt  more refreshed,  and it substantially reduced the pain.   I am currently 55, original dose lost its efficacy overtime. I am now on 125 mg, but I am very active and run and bicycle weekly.   Don&#039;t get scared if you feel even more tired in the first 2 to 3 weeks of taking the medication, that will dissipate and you will feel refreshed all day."
