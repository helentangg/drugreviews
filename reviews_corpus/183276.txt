"I started taking Cymbalta 10 months ago after developing Fibromyalgia. I am a 40 year old male in good physical condition. It is very effective for pain - not 100% - but enough that I have mostly pain free days. The pain in my hands, fingers, wrists, groin, hips and back is very manageable now. I&#039;ve also noticed that my plantar fasciatis pain is completely gone, and headaches are rare but easy to manage. Side effects include memory loss, some fatigue and difficulty with orgasm. I could not have a job or even be a good father/husband without it. My insurance covers some of the cost. "
