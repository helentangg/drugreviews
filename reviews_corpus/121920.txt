"I was recently put on Effexor and I have seen a huge improvement in my motivation and mental clarity. I actually want to get out of bed and do things. I actually want to work out. I don&#039;t want to eat all the time anymore. I am severely obese and now after being on it for almost 2 months I have lost about 10 lbs, and I feel great. I haven&#039;t noticed any detrimental side effects. It has actually increased my libido, too. I will post if I see any bad changes. "
