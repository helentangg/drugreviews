"I have only been taking 10mg for a week now and so far the side effects have been minimal, I will be bumping up to 20mg once my tummy gets use to them. I was previously on fluoxutine last year but stopped as I thought I wasn&#039;t benefiting as much as I should be in them. Starting them I went straight to 20mg and I had horrendous side effects, shaking, sweating, choking throat feeling, crying and feeling I was going crazy. I have not had this on citolapram. It is very early days tho and will up. My tight throat sensation has come back which causes more anxiety. It had dramitcally minimised since taking, I was also on proprolanol(?) For a week to see if that would help which it did but I was insistent on taking these ones."
