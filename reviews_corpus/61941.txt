"I&#039;ve been on this medication for only 5 days and although most side effects normally aren&#039;t experienced until about 2 weeks after starting a new medication, with me the effects are almost instant as my body reacts to pills differently then most people, with that said, the only side effect I&#039;ve had has been inability to orgasm what so ever I don&#039;t have a need to fake anything with my wife so she knows but it&#039;s just very annoying!!! Other then that, anxiety has been pretty good past few days, I generally avoid crowded areas but went to a couple and didn&#039;t have any problems so it&#039;s been good for me so far this week."
