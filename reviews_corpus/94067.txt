"Only been on it for a week and a half so far. The first few days caused dizziness and a bout of nausea about an hour after taking it with food. I don&#039;t get nauseous taking it anymore. I still get dizzys every now and then but they&#039;re less intense now. I can already tell a difference in my mood. I&#039;m excited to see my future progress"
