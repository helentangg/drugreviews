"This drug has changed my life. I went from not being able to leave my house for almost a year to living a full life again. It took so many medications before my Dr decided to try zoloft. I started at 25mg whIch didn&#039;t really work and then moves up to 50mg. This was better but once I got on 100mg my life has transformed. If you are doubting if it is working, don&#039;t worry I did too. Give it months not weeks. It took a long time for me to feel better on it, but I am so glad I waited. I highly recommend this drug. I has minimal side effects the first few weeks with it. The worst thing was probably the drunken feeling during week 1. Seriously, don&#039;t give up."
