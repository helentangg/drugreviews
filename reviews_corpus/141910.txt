"I used Lexapro for a year and a half.  Last resort (I mistrust drugs) for my circumstantial depression and PTSD. I was surprised to find that Lexapro worked great for me. I had almost no side effects starting up or since, it began working in 2 days, I worked up slow from 5 to 10 mg, and stayed at 10mg. A charm: I felt level, smoothed, yet still emotional and alive. NOT numb. Positive, happy mostly, tend toward joy. More tolerant and patient too. It did NOT reduce my libido, but DID cause weight gain.  30 pounds since 08 without changing my very healthy moderate diet. Weight won&#039;t budge, unusual for me. I have begun taper thinking I was ready. I&#039;m shocked that I miss it. I&#039;m a better person on it, the edges smoothed. If not for the FAT, I&#039;d continue."
