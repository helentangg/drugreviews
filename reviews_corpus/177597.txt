"I&#039;m a mom in my 40s and though my life should have been happy (great husband and kids) I was constantly worried, paranoid, combative, and quick to anger.  It took months to convince myself to call a psychiatrist but finally I did.  At first she put me on effexor but I hated it (brain zaps, teeth clenching, nausea, lethargy) I tried to hang in there but after 6 months I asked for something else.  She gave me Cymbalta.  WOW is all I can say.  No real side effects and most importantly, I&#039;m laughing and smiling again.  I don&#039;t feel angry all the time anymore and for the first time in years I&#039;m calm.  I also suffer back pain and it is seriously lessened with Cymbalta.  I pray my insurance continues to pay for it."
