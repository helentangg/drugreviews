"Absolutely Effective! 
I suffered most of my adult life with debilitating migraines. My Doc recommend that I try 25 mg at bed time (half a yellow pill) .. I rarely get migraines anymore.
I use to get migraines 4+ times a week .. now I get them MAYBE once a month (if that)

Side effects: I take this medication within one hour of wanting to be asleep. This medication kicks my ass. Knocks me out."
