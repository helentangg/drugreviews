"I got prescribed with one 10mg tablet of amitriptyline to take everynight towards 9PM, though as it is non-addictive, my Doctor said I could play around with taking 2-3 tablets if I&#039;m stressed -- I have however found one to be largely sufficient, at least for me. 
Saying it&#039;s has been a wonder drug for me would be an understatement: I will take it and within 30 minutes to 2 hours, I will drift off into a deep, albeit pleasant sleep, but it gets better: I do not feel groggy when waking and wake up naturally at a time that&#039;s convenient for me. I have never been more productive in my whole life.
You might get some unusual sensations in your head the first few days, but they aren&#039;t bothersome in the slightest."
