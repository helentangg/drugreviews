"Basically, I felt light open up to me after about 2 days.  After a week on 10mg, things felt normal but good.  Once I switched to 20mg, no change, but still much better than in the past.  Going to 40mg tomorrow.  Diarrhea was BAD at the beginning but not enough to counter the feeling of calm and peacefulness and ability to reduce the sadness and rage and sleepiness of the depression.  BAD insomnia at 3 weeks on 20mg; then 2-3 days of wanting to sleep all day.  Otherwise, so much better in the good times."
