"I was prescribed these as my Doctor insisted that I was suffering from anxiety/agitation. I was not keen on taking these but I did as I thought the Doctor knows best.
The first week I suffered most of the common side effects like dry mouth, tiredness, and feeling sick. By the second week these had gone except for the extreme tiredness and now my heart felt like it was pounding hard in my chest and I felt more anxious!
After 18 days I was feeling worse than ever and went back to see my Doctor who then advised I should stop taken the 10mg dosage. After 2 days I feel so much better for stopping and dont know why I was ever put on them !
Terrible medication with so many bad side effects!!"
