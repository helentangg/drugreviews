"I know this is early days. Only day five. The first four days were horrendous spaced out dizzy and felt sick. So changed to take citalopram at night. Seemed to be better for me that way. Today is the first day the haze has slightly lifted. But like I said early days. I&#039;m hoping that after the two weeks period that people say is the worst I loose this dizzying feeling and headache. But I&#039;m going to persevere as this med judging by the reviews does seem to do the trick."
