"I had been a marijuana smoker for many years but stopped and then found I was depressed, couldn&#039;t sleep or concentrate very well and would get panic attacks.  My drug &amp; alcohol physician put me onto Prozac but after just one tablet, I suffered anxiety and was very jittery and almost felt sea-sick and terrified.  He then prescribed Zoloft for me.  What a WONDERFUL drug!  After one day, I felt focussed, clear headed and happy.  I went on to attend Melbourne University as a mature aged student and studied philiosophy - it was amazing.  I&#039;d never felt so intelligent or capable in my life.  I eventually came off Zoloft after a few years and have never looked back.  It may not suit everyone but it certainly was just what I needed!"
