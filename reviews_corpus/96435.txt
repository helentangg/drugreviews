"I was put on Zoloft for Major Depression and General Anxiety Disorder after my baby was born about a year ago.  In general, it helped with my mood swings not being so intense, but I also found, over time, that it did not help me in stressful situations and I actually was more aggressive while taking Zoloft.  I have also gained weight on this medication and am now 30lbs over my average weight.  Some other side-effects have been dry mouth, anxiety in the mornings, more agitation, and an increase in anxiety-soothing habits (such as picking, scratching, obsessing over flaws, etc).  After taking Zoloft for a year, I&#039;ve found that it&#039;s not really helping with my depression or especially my anxiety anymore. "
