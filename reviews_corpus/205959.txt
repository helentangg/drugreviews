"I&#039;ve been on this medication for a week to treat my low grade depression which has manifested itself primarily with erectile dysfunction and insomnia.  I am 22.  Within 48 hours, I slept through the night for the first time in months.  Much of the sexual difficulties I had experienced prior to taking the Pristiq (which is the first antidepressant I&#039;ve been on) went away within the same time period.

I&#039;m yawning a lot despite not being particularly tired and I&#039;m clenching my jaw a lot.  I&#039;m more focused, excited about my sex life and just being able to sleep through the night for once is a God send.  If these are the worst side effects I have to deal with, I&#039;ll be happy."
