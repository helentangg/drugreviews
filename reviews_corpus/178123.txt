"I just took a first dose of 30 mg of Cymbalta at 4:45 p.m. and by 9:30 p.m. I developed nausea. The nausea subsided by 11:00 and the pain in my feet seemed to melt away. I have suffered for many years with chronic pain from degenerative bone spurs in my spine and fibromyalgia in my feet. This gives me a warm comfortable feeling. I pray this will work for a long time. Being in so much pain for so long and having this relief sure takes the edge off.  Thanks for the relief."
