"The first week was rough, but this medicine has totally changed my life.  I&#039;m confident, I go out and do things. Life is enjoyable and I feel optimistic about the future.  No more random panic attacks or feelings of worthlessness.  Sometimes people say I&#039;m too easy going but I can be serious when needed; basically I&#039;m in control again.  Been on it for 4 years (50mg daily) and may never go off it.  Have noticed some weight gain and hot flashes in extremely stressful/confrontational situations."
