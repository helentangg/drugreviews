"I began taking sertraline to help with panic attacks, depression, and anxiety.  These symptoms were the affect of an unhealthy work environment and having lost 3 immediate family members within 6 months.  I began taking 25mg and felt no change.  After a month and a half my doctor increased it to 50mg.  I went from being angry all the time to crying all the time. We then increased the dosage 75mg and that has done the trick.  I can not believe how well this medication works.  I am more positive, HAPPY, and able to handle an extremely difficult working environment!  I have not felt this good in years!"
