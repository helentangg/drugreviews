"I&#039;ve been on 10mg for 6 weeks now. I was prescribed 20mg but only managed this dose once and I was so ill I didn&#039;t want to take it again so decided to cut my pill in half. I felt really sick on these and sleepy so I changed to taking them in bed just before going to sleep an it worked a treat. In a very VERY anxious person I also have graves disease which causes anxiety an panic attacks daily. In the past 6 weeks I&#039;ve had 1 panic attack which only lasted 5 minutes then I was totally calm again ( very weird) I was having at least 1 panic attack a day before hand. They do take awhile to work. I would say the last week I&#039;ve noticed a huge difference. I&#039;d definitely a lot calmer and more out going. Just get past the 1st few weeks :)"
