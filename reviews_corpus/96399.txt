"I started taking 25mg Zoloft 3 weeks ago. The changes have been phenomenal in just that short a time. I have no PMS/PMDD symptoms at all right now. I hope they never return. Zoloft has changed my life. I hope it isn&#039;t too soon to tell if the good times will continue but I hope and pray they do. I haven&#039;t had any side effects except for one. If I take it in the morning, I get extremely sleepy by mid-afternoon. So I take it at night, problem solved. Maybe I&#039;m one of the lucky ones but for so many years I have suffered from PMDD with no relief, that for once, I can brag about how good I feel now! I hope the same for other women experiencing PMS and PMDD."
