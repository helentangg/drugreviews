"Pristiq has been the first and only anti-depressant I&#039;ve taken, so I didn&#039;t know what to expect. 
What I got from the daily pill was an aid, it was like having crutches; it just helped me do what I needed to do.
The first week I felt different, along with the slight nausea in the morning (I took it at night after dinner), and yawning which was only slightly annoying.
Overall it was a 100% experience."
