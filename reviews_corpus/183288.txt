"Bad nausea on the first day, about one hour after taking it (60mg) but that has eased off completely. First two nights I didn&#039;t sleep at all but that has also settled down quickly for me.  So far the side effects are minimal for me, compared with horrors of Prozac, Zoloft and Cipramil, which I could not tolerate at all."
