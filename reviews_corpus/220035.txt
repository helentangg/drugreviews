"I&#039;ve been on 20 mg of amitriptyline at bedtime for insomnia for 6 years now.  I had been on valium after a bout with acute stress disorder, but found it highly addictive and found myself going to my shrink not for therapy, but just to get my RX renewed.  I knew then that I had to get off the valium.  My GP suggested the amitriptyline, and it is great.  No side effects, and it LETS me sleep, it doesn&#039;t MAKE me sleep.  It also lets me get back to sleep if I have to get up at night to use the bathroom.  My doc told me to start with 10 mg and move up by 10 mg increments until I found a dose that worked but that didn&#039;t leave me hung over the next day.  10 mg worked.  30 mg put me in a fog til noon the next day.  20 mg has been perfect!"
