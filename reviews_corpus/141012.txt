"After years and years of being able to self-manage moderate panic attacks I suddenly couldn&#039;t help myself anymore and after a particularly bad anxiety attack I decided enough is enough, my doctor diagnosed mild depression and anxiety so reluctantly I have started taking this medication a week ago with mixed results so far, 5mg for first 3 days I felt good almost hopeful, then increased to 10mg and I&#039;ve had a rough 4 days, increased anxiety and poor sleep plus very emotional.  Everyone keeps telling me to hang in there with this as I really want this to work for me so my plan is to do just that and hope that I can report back again with better results ;)"
