"I have Fibromyalgia as well and I stopped taking Cymbalta because my pains improved a great deal, but, I had extreme nausea and exhaustion (esp. in the am).  Now my pains have come back to kick my behind.  Day 2 of Cymbalta. Seems as if it makes me light sensitive, which gives me a headache and dizzy.  Like my eyes are heavy and my skin was clammy.  I will continue.  I&#039;ll get back to you n a few weeks."
