"I have been on Cymbalta, 60 mg, for over 5 years. It did work for the Fibro pain, even though at stressful times I still felt a minimum of pain.  I began to notice after about 3 years that I was very tired all the time and foggy in the brain. It was hard for me to concentrate when someone was talking and words were hard to find when answering them.  I finally told my doctor that I wanted to wean off of Cymbalta but I haven&#039;t found this to be very easy.  Been working on it since June and if I try to lower the dose too fast I become sick like a very bad flu.  I am now more clear headed and can talk with clarity since my dose was lowered to around 20 mg."
