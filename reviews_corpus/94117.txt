"Male age 50, in good shape. I was prescribed this stuff for what I call &quot;brain fog&quot; which I was experiencing three to four times per month and lasted a minimum of 24 hours.  Also for attention span - which has been limited as of late. I am on 20mg once a day and graduated up from 5mg a day over 5 weeks. The 1st week I experienced some very slight dizziness and slight nausea. Nothing that I would describe as trying or difficult. At about week 3, I started to notice an increase in attention span. After 2 months, I have not had one brain fog episode. I have not noticed a change in mood, though I was not / am not depressed. I will say I am having some of the  best orgasms of my life - and I have been on wellbutrin which does not compare!"
