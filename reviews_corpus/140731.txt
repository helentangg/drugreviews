"was on this for 4 months for anxiety and depression. I found it awful. Depression worsened within the first month. Increased risk of self harming and urge like I never had. Restless legs for the first week while I tried to sleep and awful insomnia. Felt like a shell of who I was, impaired thinking and felt a heavy feeling in my head. Felt so much better when I came off it, worst thing I ever have done was go on this medication. Doctors hand them out now like sweets without people really knowing the risks/side effects. I understand they work for some people however this drug does not work for everyone, as stated on the info."
