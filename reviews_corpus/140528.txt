"This is a wonder drug. If you suffer from any type of anxiety, especially PTSD, and depression, especially major depression, this drug will ease your symptoms to a minimal. This is a &quot;clean&quot; feeling drugs and works great.

Now the bad side: this drug has way too many side effects to recommend to anyone that is not retired or hospitalized.
