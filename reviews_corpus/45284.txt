"I have been taking fluoxetine 20mg for 15 days now . I suffer night anxiety attacks and panic to the point were I knew I had to do something about it as it was ruining my life. I was in a car crash which initially set off the night anxiety. The medication has helped me tremendously.  I have always been very sceptical  about antidepressants and felt I could manage my anxiety myself and refused medication in the past. It caused me to lose a bit of weight and heightened my anxiety for a few days and nights but it became more bearable .  I do get the odd nights when I feel it creeping back but I&#039;m able to relax and breath it away, which I could never do before -  I would just have full on anxiety. So good luck to all who try this medication."
