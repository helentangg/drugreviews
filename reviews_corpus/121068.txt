"I was prescribed this anti depressant due to my long history with depression, and having anxiety and fibromyalgia - I find this med has been the most effective at helping to contain things enough for me to also develop strategies such as getting enough sleep even it it means 12hours in bed when required. I never rely only on meds to &quot;cure&quot; me - I use meds to contain things and then work on external things I can do to improve my lifestyle"
