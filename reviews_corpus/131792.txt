"Downside of this med is the first few days, it&#039;s tough getting in a regular sleeping sync, it can cause nausea without food or with too much water at one time, and you can&#039;t go off abruptly or start taking large doses right away because it can have side effects.

However, this medication leaves an unbelievable amount of satisfaction feeling after it takes effect.  It took effect on me instantly, but that&#039;s my body.  I take it midday or late morning after a good meal so it doesn&#039;t interrupt my sleep as much.  If you don&#039;t have slow release, splitting it up might be a good idea, with at least a few hours in between.  It prevents me from overeating, but it also prevents me from starving myself because if I don&#039;t eat enough I&#039;ll feel nauseated."
