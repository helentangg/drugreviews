"I started Paxil  to control anxiety.  The first brand was Auribindo. It worked about one month.  I was using less Klonopin. Then out of the blue I had a Panic attack that put me in the hospital overnight.  Then I switched generic brands to Zydus.  On my first dose I thought I would die.  It felt like I had overdosed. It happened within 10 minutes of taking that brand.  It was only 15mg.  I have now received the Dylan brand and will take it in the morning.  I say this for people who think the Paxil may not work.  You need to do a trial run on these no good generics.  I felt like I was dying plus so nauseated on the Zydus brand.  Hopefully the Nylon will work.  I am running out of brands to try."
