"This new Pristiq has worked wonders for me. I have tried practically every anti-depressant medication out there. I have bipolar 2 disorder, and most of the time, taking an anti-depressant alone without a mood stabilizer always set off severe mania. That has not been the case with Pristiq. Not only do I feel a million times better in every way, this drug has really decreased my appetite and I have definitely lost at least 10- 15 pounds since I started taking it about 7 weeks ago. I also take a little bit of Xanax to better manage my anxiety. However, that only enhances the already great results that I have experienced with Pristiq."
