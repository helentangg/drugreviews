"When I was on Celexa years ago it worked wonderfully for me, night and day. I came off and tried natural treatments for a year and a half with no success so I went back on Celexa (again at 40 mg a day as I was on before.) 
It definitely helps me a lot but it isn&#039;t as helpful as before when I took it. I&#039;ve added abilify 2 months ago (5mg) but it still isn&#039;t quite enough. I feel like my functionality is at about 60-70% now (compared to ~10% without Celexa) --My GP has referred me to a psychiatrist and I hope I can find something or a combo of things to help me get to 100% again soon. I don&#039;t have any bad side effects from Celexa and it helps me with anxiety within 24 hours and depression within 2 weeks of starting."
