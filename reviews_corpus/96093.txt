"I am a 22 year old male and my doctor prescribed Sertraline (Zoloft) to me about a month and a half ago in order to help me with my depression. I noticed a great ease in social anxiety, general nervousness, and feelings of hopelessness all subsided. The side effects, however, were major: I woke up every morning feeling dizzy and exhausted, no matter how much sleep I got, and this feeling lasted throughout the day. A lot of yawning. Coupled with this is a general feeling of dis-interest. I am no longer depressed, but somewhat catatonic, often passing up social opportunities."
