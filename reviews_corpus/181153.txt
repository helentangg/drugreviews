"I have struggled with anxiety and depression for about 25 years. After almost dying from meningitis in 1993, post traumatic stress disorder became an issue as well.  My general physician recently diagnosed me with major depression disorder as well.  She is an amazing Doctor who took extra schooling for psychology and pain management. She suggested I try Prozac. I had heard so many bad and controversial things about Prozac,  but decided to ignore the naysayers and try it.  I&#039;ve been on it about 2 weeks.  Not noticing too much yet,  but I am going to hang in there as I know it can take 6 to 8 weeks for full benefits. I realize I can&#039;t expect something to work right when I want it to work.  it takes time.  Giving it a chance. Will update."
