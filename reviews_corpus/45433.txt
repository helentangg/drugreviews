"I have had major depressive Dissorder since I was 13 years of age. Had pretty much come to terms with the fact that this was going to be lifelong thing. Been to therapy, groups, and tried other meds like regular &amp; generic Prozac, plus took Paxil for a little while. Prozac Weekly has been the ONLY thing that has made a huge difference for me other than being very careful about eating healthy. I forget to take daily meds so only taking it once a week is a bonus. The first time I took Prozac Weekly it took about 2-3 weeks to really &quot;kick in&quot; but once it did the difference was like night &amp; day. Is this how normal people feel? You mean I can feel like this everyday? Not sure if it will be the same for you, just my positive experience. Good luck."
