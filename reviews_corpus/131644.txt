"I have been on Effexor for over 5 years now and I cannot imagine life without it.  I was crying all the time for no reason....my dr. Put me on 75 mg a day and it made me extremely anxious.  He then upped it to 150 mg per day and I have no side effects and function great!  The only side effect I have noticed is:  if I forget to take it I start to feel dizzy after a few hours and by night am crying."
