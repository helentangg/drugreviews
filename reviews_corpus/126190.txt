"I was on and off Lexapro for many years, but I always felt tired. We tried a few combinations of anti-depressants but none of them gave me the energy I wanted--even with as high as 450 mg of Wellbutrin by itself. I&#039;ve been on 20 mg of Viibryd for the past couple of weeks as well as 300 mg of Wellbutrin.  I now have the energy and desire to go to the gym, breeze through work and housework, and visit family and friends. My sex drive is slightly improved. I&#039;ve had slight digestive issues but nothing major. I hope things continue to improve. I&#039;m impressed so far. I&#039;ll give an update as to my progress in a couple of months."
