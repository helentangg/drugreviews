"This medication works for me. Have had generalised anxiety for many years, which I could just about deal with but it was very draining. As others have said, this med takes a few weeks to start having a positive effect, and I had to take Valium with it for the initial two weeks to alleviate the side effects. The insomnia got worse before it got better. So I didn&#039;t make any judgements until after one month.

The effects are positive. I have a sense of calmness and perspective. I sleep much better. I am enjoying life much more. The downside was increased hunger and a little weight gain with it. But the positive effects mean I can make time to exercise and deal with that."
