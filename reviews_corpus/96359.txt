"I&#039;m 12, and I&#039;ve taken Zoloft for about three months now. It has helped with my anxiety, a lot, but the side effects are horrible. My depression has worsened, it has disrupted my sleep patterns, and I&#039;m never hungry anymore. I&#039;m also taking Concerta (I have ADHD, Asperger&#039;s Syndrome, Depression, Anxiety issues, and signs of mild OCD)."
