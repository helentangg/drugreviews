"Mixed review - taken for headaches, virtually cured as a result but left with a mid-sized hiatus hernia. 
Had severe migraines - actually was in a constant state of them. 
I was told to have: 
10mg for 2 weeks. 
20mg for 4 weeks. 
30 mg for the rest of the 6 months. 

I ended up going up to 20mg for the rest of the 6 months, not 30mg because I felt dysphagia symptoms and very slight heart palpitations. 
Since being off for the last 8 months, I only have migraine-like headaches once every month (usually if no sleep + anxiety). 
BE CAREFUL, I had a history of acid reflux issues. Now at 25, I have a mid-size hiatus hernia and GERD and I&#039;m on PPI&#039;s for the rest of my life!"
