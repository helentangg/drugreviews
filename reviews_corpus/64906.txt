"I am a recovering alcoholic with 20 months sobriety and it became very clear to me that simply working the steps and following the AA program would not alleviate my depression. I have been on 50mg sertraline for a week now... I have moderate side effects ranging from insomnia (which I already experience anyway), to constipation and a feeling of being drugged. I somehow have the inability to cry, which is good because I sobbed uncontrollably from depression and PTSD nearly daily. I have faith that combining an SSRI with therapy will finally give me relief. I already feel as though my emotions are evening out, as I have had less ups and downs this week. If you are in recovery I highly recommend seeking mental professional help."
