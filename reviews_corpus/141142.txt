"I have taken Lexapro 5-10mg for at least 15 years.  It was effective for me within a few days of beginning.  My anxiety causes me to be bad tempered and sometimes explosive.  (the straw that broke the camel&#039;s back).
I am calm, more focused, and am able to follow through with tasks better.
I don&#039;t know that I have experienced side effects other than trouble falling asleep.  I am 79 years old and it could be an &quot;old person thing&quot;."
