"A week ago I would have rated it less. Today (a month and 5 days after starting it) it&#039;s a 10. I started on 50 mg Sertraline, which I&#039;ve been trying to tolerate for the past 4 weeks. Nervous and hard to concentrate. For the past few nights I&#039;ve been taking 25 mg (splitting the pills in half) before bed with 1.5 mg (half pill) of Melatonin. Yesterday I decided to stop taking my Ginkgo Biloba supplement because of info I read about it with Zoloft. That night, before bed, I took the 25 mg, but waited till it woke me up to take the Melatonin. Today I feel great! Hopefully, after doing the same thing tonight I will feel the same way tomorrow."
