"Before taking this I was so anxious all the time I was angry and short tempered. I had panic attacks slight depression and irrational fears. I started at 50mg and am now 100mg. I&#039;ve been on this for a little more than a month. I&#039;ve had every side effect there is plus I seem to gag all the time for no reason but mentally it&#039;s a night and day difference. After about 3 weeks all the side effects went away. I feel like a better person and wife all around."
