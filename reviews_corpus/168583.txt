"The first week of taking 10mg of Viibryd I did okay with the exception of diarrhea; then the anxiety began to wane.  I still had &quot;anger issues&quot; so the doctor upped the dose to 20mg a day.  That was okay for a couple weeks until all of a sudden, I have terrible anxiety, very bad nightmares, bruxism (clenching teeth) and bad headaches.  I try to not to clench my teeth, but I go right back to clenching without realizing it.
I dropped the dosage down to 10mg a day and I&#039;m still not doing well.  
I&#039;m about to call the doctor and tell him what the side effects are and to choose something else...or nothing at all."
