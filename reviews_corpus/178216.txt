"Prescribed by rheumatologist for fibromyalgia (30 mg/day); have been on for just over two weeks, take it at night. Cymbalta has helped lessen my pain and has dramatically improved my mood- happier and much more relaxed. Two side effects so far: constipation and trouble sleeping. Hardly slept at all the first night or two, still only sleeping about 5 hours- waking up very early. I like the positive effects enough to weather the cons- at least for now."
