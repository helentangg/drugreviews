"I&#039;ve struggled with anxiety and depression for a long time. By the time I started on sertraline, I felt I was already pretty good at dealing with the depression side of things without medication. This drug made me getting up in the mornings easier. I felt less &quot;groggy&quot; than usual when I was on it. Other people noticed that I seemed a bit more positive. The downsides are, that I&#039;d wake up in a bad mood: feeling like I hadn&#039;t slept enough or that I&#039;d dreamed too much, and It didn&#039;t really make any noticeable difference to my anxiety."
