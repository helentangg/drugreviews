"I started on citalopram in September 2015 as I had extremely anxiety, causing me to feel depressed.
I started on 10mg after 4 weeks I went to 20mg and after 4 months on 20mg I went to 30mg.
It&#039;s been so fantastic. It did take longer than 4 weeks for optimal effect, I&#039;d say for me I started feeling better around week 9-10, but it&#039;s helped no end.
I worry less, process irrational thoughts better and anxiety has reduced 90%. 
Give it time, I truly believe if my gp had changed my medication on all my earlier visits where I was convinced it wasn&#039;t working, I would be worse off than I am now. Also engage with therapy."
