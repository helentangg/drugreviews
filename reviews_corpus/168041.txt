"I had panic attacks (Night Terrors) for over a year or more and had lost hope for  medication to help. Since the first night of taking Tofranil, I slept normal without the 3-4 am wake up(night terror) and have been free of them for 12 years without changing my medication. I am so thankful to have finely found and inexpensive medicine that actually worked from the first dose."
