"I have been on Cymbalta for depression for 3 weeks now. I have had a wide range of side effects sleeplessness, stomach cramps, loss of appetite, sweating, nausea, a constant bad taste in my mouth and a total loss of libido. I spoke to my doctor about this and he said it may take a few weeks to really kick in. I hope it hurries up. I had been on other antidepressants a few years ago with no side effects. After 2 days I feel the medicine has lifted me slightly but not as much as I would have hoped."
