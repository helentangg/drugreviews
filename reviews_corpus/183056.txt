"I&#039;ve tried about 15 to 20 different antidepressants in the last 21 years. Nothing has really helped, or it would help for awhile then stop working. Cymbalta is only the second medication that is not only a SSRI but works with the dopamine in your body,  that I&#039;ve tried. First was Pristiq and that affected me so badly I wouldn&#039;t shower for a week. I didn&#039;t want to do anything.  Now with the Cymbalta I&#039;m more energetic and less hungry and feel much better! So far it&#039;s working out wonderfully."
