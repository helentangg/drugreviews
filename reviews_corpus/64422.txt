"Setraline has worked great for me!  I have been on it for 3 months and take it for anxiety, OCD, and depression.  The first 2-3 weeks were very hard as I feel I got every side effect listed.  Headaches, more anxiety, the works!  This is the second medication I have tried.  I took Lexapro for 3 months prior to Setraline, but it didn&#039;t help me much (actually caused more depression).  It took about 3-4 weeks for me to fully see the benefits of this drug, however it causes bluntness to my good feelings and extreme fatigue.  It is very hard for me to function like this as I am a mother of 3 and need that energy/motivation to get around and not just want to lay in bed all day.  I would rate it 7 with my OCD, 9 for anxiety and depression."
