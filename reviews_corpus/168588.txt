"I have been on &amp; off antidepresants most my adult life &amp; have tried many. Was just switched from celexa to viibryd about 1 month ago &amp; it has been a living nightmare. This has by far been the worst med  I have ever been on. I have been an emotional wreck &amp; sick as hell. Nausea, dizzy, shaky, jittery, heart racing, weight gain, headaches, anger, crying &amp; several more. I have actually had to pull my car off the road &amp; sit because I was so sick.  I can&#039;t think straight at all. Tried tapering down from 20mg to 15mg for a week &amp; I felt like I was dying, so went back to 20mg. I feel like I belong in the mental ward. I see my Dr in a few days. Horrible drug, I do not recommend at all! Rather be depressed"
