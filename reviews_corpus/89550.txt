"The only reason this medication didn&#039;t receive a 10 is because of the occasional profuse sweating and difficulty achieving orgasm. Other than that, it has proven to be just the kick start I have needed for the past 2 years (failed trials with Remeron and self medication). It does not cloud my thoughts or judgment. Having said that, it doesn&#039;t add any euphoria. It merely balances out my thought process. I find it easier to be optimistic and more motivated towards daily tasks. Things that I had once lost passion for now restore my interest. Waking up in the morning is no longer a burden; a lust for life keeps me moving, enjoying every step of the way!"
