"I have been using Cymbalta for almost a year now and I am finally who I always used to be. I am able to handle daily situations without unnecessary anger or feelings of hopelessness. My world appears in focus and I have normal reactions to situations, I don&#039;t over react to simple things. I wish I had not spent so many years without treatment for my depression; they feel like the lost years of my life. Thank you Cymbalta!"
