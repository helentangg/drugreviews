"Horrible drug, will never use it again. My doctor perscribed the lowest possible daily dose to try to see if it would help for anxiety and depression.  After taking it for one week I had nausea, constant sweating, made my head feel tight and foggy, did not sleep more than 20 mins at a time because I was constantly waking with nightmares.  Been off effexor for over a month.  Sweats gone, nausea gone, feeling much better but can&#039;t sleep more than 4 hours straight then being awake for hours.  I would not recommend this drug to any one.  Get your doctor to try you on something different first.."
