"This generic works but it sure doesn&#039;t work as well as Paxil CR. The generic isn&#039;t as potent. But it&#039;s less expensive. Paroxetine seems to work for O.C.D. very well, but the weight gain sure can be a bummer.  You can be tired after taking it too; so I take it at night to help me get a good sleep."
