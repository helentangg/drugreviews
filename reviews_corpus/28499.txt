"My experience with Lexapro has been a positive one.  I&#039;ve been on it after my social anxiety became intolerable and I&#039;d hit the lowest low of my life -- had a few anxiety attacks and was doing horrible at work.  I wasn&#039;t able to keep anything straight, was disorganized, forgetful, anxious, irresponsible, irritable. I felt high anxiety in making simple decisions, writing, communicating, asserting myself, the list goes on. I started Lexapro and it took a solid 2 months for it to really start working effectively.  At that point, I became much more calm (much less anxiety), organized, together-with, and punctual (qualities I had never achieved before in my life!). I&#039;ve started to eat healthier, work out, work harder, and have joined some social clubs. Success!"
