"I took 20mg of Prozac from age 16 to 27 for depression and anxiety to make sure my conditions didn&#039;t interfere with finishing high school and college. It got rid of my anxiety and depression 100 percent. The only negatives for me were that this dose made me hyperactive/harder to concentrate, harder to orgasm, and caused some emotional numbness where it was harder to feel in love."
