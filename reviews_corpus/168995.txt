"My doctor just proscribed this medication a few days ago for major depressive and bipolar disorder, and I already feel better. I don&#039;t feel like I am about to explode. This medication is a blessing to me and my family. I can actually play with my kids again, which I&#039;ve done everyday since being on Viibrid. I love it. I just wish it would help me sleep. I don&#039;t wont to jinx it but I haven&#039;t even had the bathroom problems everyone&#039;s talking about."
