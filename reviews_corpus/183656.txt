"I have just taken my second dose of Cymbalta.  My doctor suggested that I take 20 mg for 14 days and then go to 30 mg.  Right now I can tell that my depression has noticeably subsided and my desire to sleep all day/night has decreased.  I&#039;m actually sleepy when I go to bed now.  Slept for about 4 hours and woke up and right back to sleep.  I have also noticed that I&#039;ve begun to yawn during the day which I can&#039;t ever remember doing.  But all in all I&#039;m keeping my fingers crossed that this is finally the mediation for me.  I&#039;ve been down in the valley this time for almost a year and I&#039;m ready to start living my life again."
