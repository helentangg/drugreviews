"I was originally put on Cymbalta for depression,  I was told to take it during the day which I did.  When I took the Cymbalta during the day it made me incredibly sleepy  to the point I could NOT stay awake so I discontinued it&#039;s use. Fast forward a few years and I started experiencing HORRIBLE Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy. Doctor put me on Cymbalta to try and treat the pain.  This time I took it before bed.  I didn&#039;t notice any sleepiness during the day,  and my nerve pain got better, and eventually was completely gone.  After a year of use and almost no pain at all,  I started having some &quot;break through pain&quot;.   Even though I am having &quot;break through pain&quot; after a year, the Cymbalta still makes life 100x better and I and grateful to have it!"
