"Have been on Effexor, Wellbutrin, Pristiq and on Cymbalta, none of them with the exception of Effexor have helped me. I noticed a difference after only 1-2 days on the medicine. Generally it takes between 2-4 weeks to get a build up but this seems almost instant. I started on 20mg and am still on 20mg until later this week when I go up to 40mg. The first day or two I was really wired and I think it is because I drink a lot of caffeine which I recommend cutting down on with the medicine and I got some weird electric shock sensation in my tongue but that has gone away and now I am getting the runs but I hope that goes away too. Once my body was used to the new medicine I was like a zombie, now I actually feel &quot;normal&quot; again."
