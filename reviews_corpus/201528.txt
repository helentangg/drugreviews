"I got put on this medication about 3 days ago and my first time taking it was in the morning. There are two side effects I&#039;ve had, the first day taking it I felt kinda nauseous and I threw up, but after that I was completely fine! I also have had a decreased appetite, but in my opinion that&#039;s a good thing, considering I want to lose a bit of weight. I was suffering for major depression, and got put on this medicine because I was caught in the middle of attempting suicide. But since I&#039;ve started this, I haven&#039;t had a single suicidal thought! I would definitely recommend this. Although ive been on it for just a few days, I already discover improvement."
