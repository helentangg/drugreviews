"Paxil CR helped control the anxiety and panic attacks.  It did allow me to live my life normally.  However, I have had one big side effect.  Since January, I have gained 35 lbs.  It does not matter that I workout four or five days a week for 1 1/2 or two hours, and try to eat a healthy diet.  No matter what I did, I continually gained weight.  My doctor has now taken me off of it, due to the rapid weight gain I have experienced.  She felt that the rapid weight gain was not healthy, and could lead to obesity if I did not quit taking the drug.  So, I am going to come off of Paxil CR, hopefully drop this excessive weight, because I have never had a weight problem until now and I am 31 years old, and just go from there."
