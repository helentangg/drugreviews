"This medicine does wonders.  I am a 27 year old male who suffered from severe cyclical depression.

This drug, (also known as fluoxetine when I get it cheaper), did wonders for my outlook and disposition of the world.  It feels as if a solid barrier has been thrown up in my mind against things which would otherwise stress me out or cause depression.  It also has a profound stabilizing effect in general on mood, thoughts, and feelings.

I am deeply thankful for this drug.  I would suggest trying it if you are reading this and suffer from these conditions."
