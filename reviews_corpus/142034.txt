"I started taking Lexapro 9 days ago for anxiety and depression.  Immediate positive improvement seen in both, within a day or so.  In contrast to other reviews I&#039;ve read, my sex drive has actually improved since the depression has subsided. I am having some weird side effects - like a lump in the throat causing difficulty swallowing. This has been pretty bothersome.  I&#039;m hoping it subsides because I finally feel like I can get on with my life and have more focus because I&#039;m not always crying, depressed or anxious.  Like another reviewer, I feel more like &quot;the real me&quot; than I&#039;ve felt in a long time.  No major appetite/weight changes to report yet.  I just hope the throat lump thing subsides soon."
