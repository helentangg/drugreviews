"I was first put on this med because I suffer with migraines and the doctor wanted to see if it would help with them. Far as my IBS goes I was put on Dicyclomine which wasn&#039;t helping me at all. After being on Nortriptyline for my migraines I stared taking noticed that it was helping me with my IBS. I wasn&#039;t having the sharp pains anymore and didn&#039;t have to worry about staying near a bathroom. Seeing that Nortriptyline wasn&#039;t helping me with my migraines the doctor took me off of the meds. I&#039;ve been off of it for a month and since then my IBS has been in full effect. So my family doctor put me back on them which I will start tonight. Can&#039;t wait for it to get back into my system so it will get it back straight"
