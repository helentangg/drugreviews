"I am 46 &amp; diagnosed with Fibromyalgia 4 months ago after 1.5 years of unexplained pain, muscle fatigue, exhaustion, etc. The last flare up was so severe I was unable to walk because leg muscles trembling, forearms felt like they were on fire with thousands of needles or bees stinging. I was dropping things. I was very confused and unable to even read an email on my computer.  We started with a low dose and am now at 60 mg at bedtime. Along with Tramadol during the day and Flexeril for severe flare ups, as well as moderate exercise, no chocolate, and adequate sleep, I am doing so well.  Very few side effects.  I am working full time, can wear high heels again &amp; stay awake past 7:00 pm now as well as resuming doing normal household chores."
