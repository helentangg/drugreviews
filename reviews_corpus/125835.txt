"I started viibryd for anxiety disorders, major depressive disorder and paranoia. I have been taking it for 9 days (the starter pack). Now on 20 mg.  It seems to be working great for my depression, paranoia and I don&#039;t get irritated like I used to. My outlook on life has changed dramatically. Happier and still able to achieve orgasm, unlike other antidepressants. I take Ativan at night for sleep and anxiety, so I have not had any nightmares. The only downfall with viibryd is my back and neck are very tense and achey. Diarrhea first few days but it goes away. Has anybody else experienced muscle aches/tension? If so please let me know."
