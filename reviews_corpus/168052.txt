"I have had awesome results with this drug, after going through a rough year being taken on &amp; off of medications that almost ruined my life.  My Dr has been sending me to check my blood levels &amp; they seem to keep going up.  I was taking 200 mg at night &amp; he dropped it to 175mg.  It took 3 weeks to start feeling withdrawal &amp; it was awful.  He then increased it back to 200 mg &amp; my imipramine levels are higher then they have ever been.  I am scared he is going to reduce or try to put me on another drug.  Anyone ever had problems with blood levels of imipramine?"
