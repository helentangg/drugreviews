"I&#039;ve tried every anti-depressant out there and for some reason couldn&#039;t seem to find one that eliminated my problems all at once! Depression, anxiety, panic attacks and a little obsessive compulsive disorder! Just to name a few. I&#039;ve been on Lexapro for 4 years now and it&#039;s the best medication of its kind out there. The only time I get a little anxious is if I have had a late night and a few too many drinks but that&#039;s expected. Anyone looking to take anti-depressants with basically no side effects. I highly recommend Lexapro."
