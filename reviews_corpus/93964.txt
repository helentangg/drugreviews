"I&#039;ve had MDD for over 19 years and have been on numerous antidepression medications. Most recently my Dr switched me to Trintellix. I took it at night after reading about nausea side effect and had very little. Did have some itching (stopped within 2 weeks) and had bad irritability.  My Dr added a small dose of Abilify and the irritability went away within a week. Thinking of switching from Abilify as add-on to Wellbutrin instead because of large weight gain which primary Dr thinks is from the Abilify. Overall it helped me a lot when nothing else was working anymore."
