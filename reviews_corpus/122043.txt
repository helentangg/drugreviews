"I was prescribed Effexor XR for anxiety and it has worked wonderfully. I have NO panic attacks, my constant level of anxiety is gone. However, I think it has worsened my depression slightly. Everyone responds to this medicine differently I guess, and I am more than willing to deal with minor depression if it means my anxiety is gone. This medicine has been great."
