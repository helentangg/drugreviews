"I have suffered from anxiety for about 10 years now. I am 31. Recently it took on a life of its own and I could not control it anymore. It was affecting my entire life. Every morning I would wake up barely able to breathe and dreaded the day. I HATE taking medications. But I knew I had to do something to get help. With the help of my family and friends I finally went to my doctor and he put me on lexapro. For me the side effects were not bad. For the first 5 days I was very drowsy and kind of spaced out for a few hours after taking my 5mg dose. My doctor told me to take it at night going forward and that solved those issues. After a week or so on the meds it has taken the edge off and I feel better! I wake up happy."
