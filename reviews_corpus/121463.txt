"Taking Effexor in the beginning was hard to get used to but after 6 months I felt great. Down side is I have headaches and sweat a lot. If I miss more than 4 days then I have withdrawal symptoms.  I&#039;m taking 150 mg a day and despite the side effects I wouldn&#039;t change a thing. Oh yeah I have also lost weight while taking Effexor."
