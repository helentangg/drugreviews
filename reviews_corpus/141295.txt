"I have been on Zoloft for 5 years and it was horrible for first 4 months!  Then it began to work.  But after 5 years and had recently upped to highest dose, it stopped working.  So after discussion with psychiatrist, decided to try Lexapro.  I was weaning slowly off the Zoloft and was doing good then boom!  Horrible brain zaps, unorganized thinking, it was terrible!  Psych told me to start with a quarter of  a 10mg tab, as I continued to wean of the Zoloft.  The very next day was great...no more brain zaps, mood stabilized because the side effects from weaning off Zoloft were gone!  I&#039;m now on the full 10mg Lexapro and down to about 10mg of Zoloft.  Lexapro is great so far. I am well pleased.  I also take 1mg Klonipin twice daily."
