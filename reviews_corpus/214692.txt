"Oh my goodness! Can I give this drug a negative rating? Took it for one day and felt like a dang maniac! Took it before bed,  and the next morning I woke up and felt so nauseous. I have taken Zoloft and Paxil at other times in life  and I have never felt so sick and manic - absolute worst feeling ever! Took several days for that one dose to leave my system. However, having sex that night I had the most intense orgasm!"
