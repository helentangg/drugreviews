"I have been on Celexa (Citalopram) for a little over 3 years now. It is amazing how drastic it has changed my anxiety and depression. I have had severe anxiety and panic attacks right before I started on the medication. After receiving the medication, I didn&#039;t take it for about 6 months because I read the side affects about low sex drive LOL! During those six months I would have to take a klonopin (Xanax) almost every day because I would have bad anxiety or a panic attack. After the six months, I couldn&#039;t take it any longer and I gave in. It usually takes about 2 to 3 weeks to really kick in but when I tell you, that medication helped dramatically. I NEVER have anxiety anymore even for the things that would usually give me anxiety."
