"I was started on 5mg for anxiety that was severely disabling me. I had a dreadful jittery nervous feeling all the time, couldn&#039;t lift a cup of coffee without spilling it because of the shakes, had a dreadful nauseous seasick feeling. When I started the medication I felt a lot worse for about a week but gradually I began to notice a difference. Shakes were not so bad, could hold my teeth together without chattering. Then the nausea subsided. My doctor decided to increase the dosage to 10mg. It was hell for a week. The symptoms were back with a vengeance. Then after a week they settled down, I began to feel very calm and centred and my anxiety was hugely lessened. This medication has been a lifesaver."
