"I started having episodes of anxiety approx 1 1/2 yrs ago.  Recently became a daily issue.  Missing- work/ fishing/ hunting etc.  Doc. Prescribed fluoxetine. 20mg daily. By week 2 things had gotten so bad,  I was house bound with every side effect known! ReallyBad!  Couldn&#039;t function, almost lost my very good job!   Friend took me to Dr. He said stop taking it and now I take alprazolam when I feel an attack &quot;coming on&quot;. Does the trick.   Just a reminder not everyone reacts the same to medications!"
