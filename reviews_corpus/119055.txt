"I have been on Zoloft for quite a few years. I absolutely love it, except for recently (the last few months) I have been getting headaches if I miss a couple. Otherwise, I&#039;ve had no other side effects and it has helped with the suicidal thoughts. It&#039;s helped me gain perspective and think about my feelings instead of just automatically feeling down."
