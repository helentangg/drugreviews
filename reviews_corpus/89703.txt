"I started Celexa 20mg about 2 months ago for generalized anxiety disorder and depression. I was on Effexor a few years ago but it made me nauseous and I had ZERO sex drive. 
Since I started the Celexa my anxiety has been greatly reduced. Although I still do struggle with it sometimes, it has made a big difference. I came off it for just a few days earlier this month because I ran out, and I saw how much it had been doing because my full anxiety came rushing back, but I started it right back up. I am going to start the 30mg and hope that really helps control the anxiety fully. 
The only side effect I had was decreased sex drive and difficulty having an orgasm but that only lasted one week, and then my sex drive became completely normal again."
