"I&#039;ve been on Lexapro for 2 years. Just recently switched to Effexor and Klonopin. Lexapro never really did much for me. At first, after the 2-week adjustment to the medicine which was hell, I thought it worked. But it may have just been placebo more than the medicine. Had multiple serious near life-changing anxiety attacks while on Lexapro which is why I switched. I couldn&#039;t be happier for switching. If you have anxiety, don&#039;t waste your time with an SSRI. Also, I&#039;ve stopped taking lexapro multiple times. It&#039;s not too hard, you get aggravated at everything for a few days, the brain shocks aren&#039;t nearly as bad as people say they are."
