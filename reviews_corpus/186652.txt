"Pristiq is &quot;the one&quot; for me. It&#039;s the refined version of Effexor and it has almost completely relieved my PTSD symptoms. Very little side effects, not too much emotional blunting. No flashback to &quot;the event&quot; or panic attacks. And unlike when I took Effexor, I have no unacceptable loss of inhibition. So I&#039;m happy with this one. I take 100mg daily."
