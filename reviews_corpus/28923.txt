"Lexapro has been a God send for me. I started off with 10 mg and it didn&#039;t do a thing, so I was increased to 20 mg, and wow what a difference. I now find myself actually starting conversations with people - something the pre-Lexapro me could have never dreamed. I feel so much more relaxed - like a real person, finally. No side effects at all either except it definitely increases the effects of alcohol. Didn&#039;t really do much for my depression, but I think just feeling less anxious is helping it along."
