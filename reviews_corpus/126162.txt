"I&#039;ve tried just about everything on the market for depression, and I can tolerate almost none of them.  The first dose I took of Vilazodone was only 5 mg (cut a 10 mg in half), because I am extremely sensitive to medications.  Within a a couple hours, I had lost a lot of muscle control and felt very weak.  It scared me, but I also felt incredibly calm and happy.  Once the side-effects wore off, I was afraid to take it again but intrigued at how good I felt.  I then cut the 5 mg in half and have taken 2.5 mg for the past two days (you definitely need a pill splitter) I have had none of the muscle side effects, but definitely had intestinal upset this morning and a little drowsy.  I am going to try taking it at night to see if this helps."
