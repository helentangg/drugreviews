"I was started on 25mg Zoloft about 3 1/2 weeks ago for long term anxiety and depression, and it has made a huge positive impact on my life already.  For the first two weeks my side effects included decreased appetite, hands shaking, head fogginess, insomnia, headaches, nausea, dizziness, and clenching/grinding my teeth when I slept.  Except for the decreased appetite (which I am happy about), all of the side effects are gone and it was well worth waiting them out, I promise.  I did have to play around with the time I took it and found that morning works the best for me.  Not having those crippling feelings of anxiety and not being so miserable all the time - I should have done this a long time ago.  I&#039;m finally getting my life back."
