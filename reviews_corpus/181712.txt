"I am a 38 year old female with terrible insomnia for 6 years. I finally sought help to figure out what was causing it, since none of the medicines were working for me any longer. I was diagnosed with depression and prescribed 10 mg of Prozac. It has been of amazing help to me.  I now take 20 mg which is perfect.  I have suffered no side effects and am VERY sensitive to medicines.  The only thing I noticed was a very slight decrease in appetite. Prior to taking Prozac I felt like I was in a fog, I had no desire to do anything and that is hard with 2 young kids. I have decided to embrace the fact that I suffer from depression. I was also prescribed 25 mg of Seroquel for my insomnia. Life is better for me thanks to Prozac. Insomnia still work in progress."
