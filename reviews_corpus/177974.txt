"I started Cymbalta about 3 months ago for depression.  At 30 mg I was fine.  We increased.  They are worse than when I was going through menopause.  My body is hot all the time.  My feet are always hot and sweat.  I don&#039;t want to stop the Cymbalta because it has had such a dramatic effect with the depression.  I feel like me again mentally.    I don&#039;t think these are listed as side effects. "
