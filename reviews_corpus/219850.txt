"Be careful if you have IBS-C as this can make it worse, particularly at high doses, try and take it at a low dose if you do for anxiety which is good for numbing in IBS in general. However seeing as IBS-C is basically an issue with bowels not moving fast enough you can imagine how adding a sedative essentially isn&#039;t really the best thing to add lol made mine so much worse after a year, anyways what works for some doesn&#039;t always work for others, good luck whatever you do :-)"
