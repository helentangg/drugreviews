"As a child and an adult I would cry over nothing at the drop of a hat. I would get mad at myself for crying. People did not want to be around me because they never knew when I would break into tears. It was horrible. I have been treated for depression before and I now realize that I have a family history of depression. It is considered taboo in my family. However, none of family had the crying episodes like I did. A friend suggested Lexapro. I went from 10mg to 20mgs and then to 40mgs. I do not cry nearly as easily as I did. I have not had any of the side effects that are listed. My mood is consistent and the crying spells are over. If I miss 2 or 3 days of Lexapro, everyone including myself can tell. This medicine has changed my life."
