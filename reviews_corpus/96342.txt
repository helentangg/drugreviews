"I started using Sertraline HCL for my major depression.  I started out with 1/2 50mg pill for 1 week then switching to the entire pill from then on.  By the beginning of the 2nd week I noticed a better mood in general.  My husband also noticed a different in my moods.  So for mental clarity, etc. it was great.  The side effects, however, just became unbearable and I stopped taking it after 3 weeks.  Mild/temporary side effects were nausea for about 2 days during the first week then the sweating started.  By the start of the 2nd week I was sweating all the time.  My face broke out in huge pimples (not normal for me) and my neck itched like crazy!  Doctor told me to stop taking it and as quickly as it lifted my mood, it dropped it again."
