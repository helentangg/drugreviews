I pulled into the Doctors office contemplating going up stairs to the office (anxiety). I felt weak asking for Male advise from my Male Doc?

I told the Doctor about my previous experiences on SSRI&#039;s and how they made my mood worse. He prescribed me 50mg of Zoloft and after 5-6 weeks, I was me again. It doesn&#039;t feel drug induced, it just kicks your bad thoughts completely. No ill side effects. But thats my story!"
