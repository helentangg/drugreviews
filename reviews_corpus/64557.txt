"Sertraline saved my education and my life. I had the side effects of mild dizziness for 3 days, decreased appetite for 3 weeks, and decreased sex drive for 3 weeks. Both came back though.

I&#039;m in my final year of high school, and I have struggled so much for the past 4 years due to severe panic disorder and MDD. I came very close to completely dropping out and being uncontrollably agoraphobic. I cried almost daily, things hit me harder than they did other people, my dad was at a loss. I was a straight A student until my severe mental illness almost ruined me.

Sertraline 50mg has helped me learn to cope. I haven&#039;t missed a day of school due to anxiety this year, no unexpected full-blown panic attacks, I barely ever cry. 
I&#039;m stronger."
