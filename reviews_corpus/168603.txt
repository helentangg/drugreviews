"At first I loved this medicine it seemed to be working for the depression. But after upping my dosage to 40mg I began to experience brain zaps and if I didn&#039;t take it within a 24 hour period I would feel horrible. A year and a half later I have experienced brain zaps, sleep paralysis,  memory loss, horrible vivid nightmares, headaches, blurred vision in my left eye. I went to my doctor and he is weaning me off of it.  Just started Friday 01/13/2017 and I have not been able to function. This medicine is wicked. It needs to be taken off the market."
