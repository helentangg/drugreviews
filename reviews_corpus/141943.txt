"I am a 26 year old man who has mild depression. I constantly took my problems out on others and lost my cool at the first hint of a problem. Now that I am on Lexapro I am not 100 percent better but I&#039;m at least 50%, which is better than nothing. I think if it wasn&#039;t for Lexapro I would have eventually had a breakdown."
