"Zoloft worked wonders for me. I feel like a new and improved person. My social anxiety is almost totally gone and I feel much happier, able to enjoy life to the fullest. 

Luckily, I have limited side effects: only vivid dreams (which is the most bothersome side effect) and occasional upset stomach, but nothing too bad. Of course all antidepressants have very different effects on everyone but it worked for me. I don&#039;t mean to sound like a commercial but I have really noticed a change and I feel much less anxious and depressed."
