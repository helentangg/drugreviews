"I suffered PMDD that came on exactly day 14 of my cycle. For another 12 days I would be incredibly irritable, teary, depressed, high anxiety and ruining the relationships around me. I also couldn&#039;t study and struggled often to get to work or to even drive myself home from my boyfriends. I started antidepressants but then freaked out and stopped, then actively tried other options for a whole year before trying them again and coming to terms with the fact it was probably my best option. I wasn&#039;t expecting them to work the way they have, I just feel like a normal human and like my personality is back. I can function and I have enjoyment in life that I didn&#039;t before. Haven&#039;t really experienced any side effects either."
