"At first I was reluctant to take a pill even though I had been diagnosed with major depression.  My family talked me into taking this medication. I am on my third week of taking Zoloft. The first week my doctor started me on 50mg.  The first few days I felt awful but stuck with the medication. I had not felt much relief in my depression and anxiety on 50mg so my psych doc put me on 100mg after two weeks.  I am on day 4 taking 100mg sertraline and have already started to notice a difference in my mood.  I am less anxious and worry much less at work.  I am also beginning to venture out of the house more than I used to.  The only side effects I&#039;ve had on sertraline are mild headache, diarrhea, and decrease in sexual performance."
