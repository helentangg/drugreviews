"300mg 2x 150mg pills both in the morning no other medications. 
You can&#039;t say this medication doesn&#039;t cause immediate effects. I need to wake up 1 hour earlier than I normally would to ingest these pills. Otherwise I could suddenly &#039;wake up&#039; on the highway behind the wheel of my car with  no previous memory of how I got there or where I am, or how to get where I&#039;m going.(Been in the same city and surrounding for 24 years) puts my head in a haze... makes it extremely difficult to concentrate. Sex drive is almost none existant, can lose sex drive IN THE MIDDLE OF SEX no climax, no build up. Just nothing. Complete lose of interest. 
Weight gain, with no appetite. 
Emotional disconnection. 

Without 
Crippling depression, and emotional wreck."
