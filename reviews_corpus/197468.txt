"I suffer from an acute panic disorder which causes me depression. Paxil is a great drug along with my Xanax. I take 30mg a day of Paxil in the morning and 0.5mg 3 times a day of my Xanax. Without Paxil I would have the fear all the time even if I take the Xanax. This drug has saved my life, as most of us know that having a panic disorder with depression it feels like you are crazy yet we are not. I would recommend this drug to anyone who suffers both depression and panic attacks. I also have agoraphobia which means I can not leave my house. Sometimes of course I have to yet someone is always with me. It has been 2 years now that I have not gone out on my own, because of my fears. I highly recommend Paxil to anyone. It works great for me."
