"I used paxil many, many years ago when going thru a bad divorce and it worked very well.
Then after a few years on this stuff it stopped working.
Well here I am over 15 years away from these types of meds, I lost my son and went into a deep depression.
Not really wanting to go back on SSRI&#039;s (paxil) I was convinced by my doc to try paxil again. BAD mistake, after using 20 mg for 5 weeks ...nothing!
I went bac even worse!
This stuff (paxil) is really BAD. I went cold turkey and went thru 7 days of HELL!
But now I can finally say I am off of this type of stuff FOREVER ! and I&#039;m feeling great. I started to look at the good things in my life day by day. This really works."
