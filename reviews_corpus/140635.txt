"I have been on lexapro for generalized anxiety. I started 5mg for 4 wks, just upped it to 10 mg one wk ago.  For the first week I had slight headaches, sweaty palms and hot flashes.  When I went on 10mg I had a little increase in anxiety and trouble staying asleep, but hopefully this passes.   I felt my anxiety decrease the first couple days on it, but the feeling of &quot;dread&quot;  is just starting to decrease after 4 weeks.  Overall I this medicine is great and I helping me function and live a normal life."
