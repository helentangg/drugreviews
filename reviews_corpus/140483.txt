"So far, I&#039;m still in the beginning stages of taking this medication. I&#039;ve had anxiety a lot in my life but about a month ago I had a really bad anxiety attack causing me to have the worse attacks every single day. Finally I was prescribed 10mg and taken half to get adjusted. The symptoms and side effects have been horrible. But I&#039;ve only been on it for 3 days. Seems like I have good moments and seem more calm. But at night it&#039;s harder to fall asleep and the mornings I&#039;m more anxious. I&#039;m totally exhausted and my feet and legs are tingling the night before but that is almost gone today. I stay positive . I&#039;m hoping I see positive effects. "
