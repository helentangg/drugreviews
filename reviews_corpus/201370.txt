"I&#039;ve recently started taking Zoloft 25mg for my anxiety and panic attacks. I&#039;ve suffered from anxiety since 10 grade in high school and I am now 21. I&#039;ve tried many other anxiety meds and they made it worse. I found Ativan helped me the most however my doctor doesn&#039;t want me to have it because it is addictive and she wants me on something every day. So, I&#039;ve been on Zoloft for 4 days now. I know it takes 2-4 weeks or more for me to be able to feel the full effects. I am experiencing nausea, stomach pain, diarrhea, hot flashes, and being kind of out of it. I know these side effects will eventually go away but my worry is how long? I already suffer from other stomach/digestion issues and it makes it hard."
