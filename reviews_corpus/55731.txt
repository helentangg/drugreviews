"I was put on EFFEXOR for depression &amp; anxiety. (Was on PAXIL  for many years) I told the nurse /practitioner I felt pretty good but always wondered if there was &quot;something better&quot;After starting on EFFEXOR I did have vivid dreams,and headachy,nausea &amp; dizziness and unable to have an intense orgasm (always fell short.)The big problem came when I ran out of pills and they wouldn&#039;t refill until I saw a nurse. So w/o my pills for 3 days..OMG! Terrible withdrawals..dripping w sweat,terrible headaches, insomnia, nausea, diarrhea to feeling hopeless &amp; extreme dizziness AWFUL!!! DON&#039;T RUN OUT! I was terrified of going off the pill (switching to wellbutrin) Day two on 1/2 tab and so far so good!:) effexor may have
its place..just not w ME!:) you need to wean off them slowly!!!"
