"Went to the doctor complaining of anxiety.  Was waking up and not falling back asleep or even worse could not fall asleep.  Was also having anxiety attacks.
The last time this happened I was prescribed effexor which was a nightmare and Celexa which did nothing for me.  Ended up quitting my job and with time off I returned to normal.  Quitting my job this time is not a option so the doctor put me on Pristiq.  Noticed a  positive effect within 7 days and I have been on it for a month now.  This drug has worked absolute wonders for me.  I have had no side effects at all (and no sexual impotency)."
