"I take 10 mg/day. Before I started taking this I felt as though I had severe PMS everyday. I suffer from moderate to severe depression, anxiety, mood swings, anger problems, and OCD. My therapist has diagnosed me with PTSD. Anyway, the first week of taking this I had a lot of side-effects. I took it in the evening, and had insomnia. Waking up a lot at night. Initially, the first week, I also had decreased appetite and chest pain that would come and go. After the first week I began taking it in the morning. The insomnia and all other symptoms subsided, but then I became extremely tired during the day. I&#039;m now taking it in the evening again. Helps A LOT. No more depression or irritability. Only problem now is increased appetite."
