"I&#039;ve been on Lexapro for two days with Ativan for emergencies. I&#039;m very pleased with Lexapro for being just a few days and already seeing a difference, plus medicine usually makes me very sick and this did not. Its nice to go to bed and not have 2 or 3 panic attacks with over thinking and palpitations. My only dislike, so far, is that it makes my teeth feel very strange and it&#039;s a little annoying. And also since it makes me tired, I take it before bed. But if I miss that window of being severely tired and don&#039;t fall asleep, then I am up for hours and hours. Still very tired, but restless. I hope to see those side effects go away after a long period of taking them."
