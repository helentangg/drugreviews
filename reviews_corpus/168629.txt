"Had bad side effects when I started taking this drug. The side effects went away after a week, but this drug did nothing for my anxiety. In fact a few days after my doctor switched me to this med my anxiety was worse than it ever was, I felt as if I was going to crawl out of my skin. Doctor switched me back to Lexapro and I seem to be doing better."
