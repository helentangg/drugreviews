"I have had the same experience as many.  The 50mg worked well but anxiety is now a problem and I have to force myself out of bed. Don&#039;t feel like I function well. Love the weight loss but now I have had it combined with Celexa and it is not making me feel buoyant at all. I am not sure if I suffer from ADHD or may have some bipolar... this drug is not the miracle I had hoped for....I have been on it for almost 3 months."
