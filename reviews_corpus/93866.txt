"I&#039;ve been on Trintellix 20 mg x 10 months, 53-year-old female with long-standing, chronic MDD &amp; anxiety since pre-teen years.  Been on far too many antidepressants over the decades to list them all here.  Been hospitalized a number of times &amp; in my 30&#039;s, resorted to ECT as a last resort, which did absolutely nothing. My psychiatrist says my MDD is very treatment-resistant.  Antidepressants, even in high doses, or combined, have no effect.  But I do believe for once in my life, the Trintellix is making some difference for the better in me; hasn&#039;t been a &quot;miracle&quot; drug, but it does help!  No nausea or side effects, either! Also on Xanax, trazodone for sleep, &amp; 10 mg Adderall daily."
