"I am diagnosed with severe depression.  Since started taking 25 mg things improved in the first 3 days. I stopped crying and was able to work on my issues communicating with the surrounding in a more positive way.  We upped the dose to 50 mg. The only drawback are vivid dreams that I am having, Night sweats, And I feel extremely sleepy at 10-11 am if I don&#039;t get out of the house. I also feel more tired throughout the day. But it doesn&#039;t affect my workout routine for example. Of course the drug doesn&#039;t solve my problems but it  gave me possibility to calm down and look at things in a better brighter light and enables me to communicate my concerns without agitation, or crying, or screaming or yelling."
