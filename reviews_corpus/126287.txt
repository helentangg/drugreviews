"I only gave Viibryd a 5 out of 10 due to one thing: diarrhea.  If it wasn&#039;t for that I would still be taking it. It was a hit and miss thing for me. I would go over a week and be fine and then week after week I would have diarrhea at around 2-3 times a week.  Tried it with food and after food and didn&#039;t seem to help. Don&#039;t get me wrong, I can deal with a little diarrhea but this was insane diarrhea with bad stomach cramps.  Took it around 6 months and weened myself off it. Would not recommend quitting cold turkey. Even weening myself off at 20mg&#039;s made me real irritable for about 2 weeks. "
