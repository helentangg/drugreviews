"Day 2. Taking for major anxiety/ slight depression. 10mg daily. Anxiety is lifting and feel much more in control and calm. Only side symptom is a slight wheezy/ tired feeling. I took it last night about 9pm and was asleep by 11pm. First time in a year that a fell asleep without racing thoughts and worries."
