"I am taking 60 mg of Cymbalta for anxiety and depression.  Previously I had been on Lexapro (which gave me nightmares) and Paxil, which worked for a time but sent me into a relapse when I was weaned off of it.  I have noticed a few side effects - the most predominant one is that it makes me very tired.  I don&#039;t have much of an appetite, but when I do, I crave sweets and have put on a few pounds as a result.  Very little sex drive, though it was low to begin with.  Although the medication has helped to keep my anxiety at a manageable level, my general mood has been very blank - I feel very little in the way of happiness or sadness.  My doctor has suggested either switching to a higher dose (120 mg) of Cymbalta, or changing to Zoloft or Paxil."
