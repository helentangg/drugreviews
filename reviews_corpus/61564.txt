"I could barely sit in restaurants, I was constantly on edge feeling unsafe everywhere, obsessed with checking my pulse, I was in and out of derealisation feeling constantly floaty in a horrible way. Week 1-6 of citalopram - anxiety got worse, Hot flushes, or one part of my body was burning hot. Appetite was completely gone, and the nausea was quite bad. End of week 3 the physical symptoms started to pass and anxiety lifted. From week 3-6 my mood was all over the place, went from feeling normal to suicidal to desperately depressed and depression wasn&#039;t what I was being treated for. So beware of extreme mood changes because that is scary. But now week 8 and I feel 80% back to normal. I know is desperate but stick it out and it will be great!"
