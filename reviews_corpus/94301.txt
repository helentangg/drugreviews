"I&#039;ve been on Brintellix for just over 2 months and it&#039;s helped my depression tremendously. I&#039;ve been on several SSRIs and this is far and away the best one I&#039;ve tried. It kicked in a little faster and the lack of side effects is remarkable. (I was irritable when I increased my dose from 5mg to 10mg, but it subsided after a month and I took Klonopin as needed to help. I also noticed some mild scalp tingling which another person mentioned.) No sexual side effects, no weight gain, no TMJ, no night sweats! I&#039;d recommended titrating up SLOWLY if you have anxiety/irritability (cut those annoying egg-shaped pills in half) and taking it with a meal to prevent nausea."
