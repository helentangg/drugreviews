"I have depression, anxiety and major back and neck pain as well as many other problems. I was looking for an antidepressant that works as well as something to help with my frequent sleep paralysis. Fortunately I found one that works. Effexor XR helps tremendously with the night time attacks. Unfortunately when starting (lowest dose) I had major headaches and nausea for the first two days. I also sweat a lot in general and made symptoms of sweating much worse, as well as feeling hot all the time. The benefits of stopping the sleep paralysis outweigh any other side effects. So for me I&#039;m sticking to it since I finally can sleep better. I hear getting off of it is awful, so do so carefully! When I stopped for 2 days it was just like I started, Nausea and major headaches, weird."
