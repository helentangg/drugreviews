"I started with Prozac and could not sleep at all.  With Effexor 150mg, I could sleep standing up and was so sedated that I could not function.  Withdrawal from 150mg to 75 to 37.5mg was OK, but after that withdrawal was hell with dizzyness and nausea.  Changing back to 75mg, I still slept well, had a good sense of well being and could still function. With it 20 years now"
