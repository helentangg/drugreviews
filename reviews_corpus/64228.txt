"Had a very difficult first two weeks on it had depression for years not seeing much change but gonna give it two weeks. Then see what happens had a lot of suicidal thoughts on them very anxious to come off as I have heard it gets more difficult if you withdraw from sertraline I haven&#039;t slept well for sometime. My mind is racing constantly really hoping this get better glad I am not alone and other people struggle on it."
