"This medicine has changed my life for the better. My anxiety became so bad that I couldn&#039;t sleep AT ALL. I became very obsessive with my worries and thought that everything was the end of the world. I was paralyzed with fear. When I started Lexapro I had A LOT of side effects that almost caused me to not continue...irritable, waking up in panic, night sweats, etc. After about 4 weeks I started to feel &quot;normal&quot; and calmer. I tried going off after two years which was a big mistake...back on and plan on staying on for a long time!"
