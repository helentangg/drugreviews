"I&#039;ve been on Lexapro 10mg for 5 years now and it makes me &quot;me&quot; again.  It&#039;s wonderful! I&#039;ve never had a side effect.  I&#039;ve also lost 90 pounds!  I was eating because of the stress and depression and when that started to go away so did the overeating! I started to feel a lot better.  It took about 4-5 weeks for it to kick in and I had to chart my progress through my doctor but I am truly thankful. "
