"I&#039;ve been on pretty much every antidepressant. SSRI&#039;s do nothing for my depression. The only other medication that helped was Wellbutrin, but I stopped that due to not being able to sleep at all. 
I started on 5 mg then increased to 10 mg 2 weeks later. It has helped my depression the most and I have more energy. The side effects are what make me hate taking this. I&#039;ve experienced nausea, vomiting, constipation, and decreased sexual desire. The worst though is the nausea. I&#039;m nauseous every time I take it, doesn&#039;t matter if I eat with it or not. If I don&#039;t eat before I take it then I vomit. This medication is also expensive, it&#039;s not covered by my insurance."
