"It took a month at 60mg a day to notice a big change. After two months of treatment with parnate I am feeling wonderful! I&#039;m able to go out in public without panic, I&#039;m more social, I&#039;m dating again, and my energy level is up. I&#039;ve lost over 30 pounds in the first 7 weeks of treatment- which is great for me since other meds I have been on made me gain a lot of weight.  This medication is wonderful, but takes time to fully kick in."
