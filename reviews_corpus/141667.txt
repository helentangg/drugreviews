"I was put on Lexapro for depression. I also had a bad case of obsessive compulsive disorder and a little anxiety. Lexapro did wonders for me. I am rarely sad anymore. My OCD is almost gone. I feel a lot better about myself. I used to be very shy and insecure because of my anxiety. But now, I&#039;m more confident and able to talk to people without feeling so anxious and scared."
