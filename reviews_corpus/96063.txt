"I am in my 30s and have been experiencing debilitating panic attacks since I was a teenager to the point where I could not function on a day-to-day basis. Sertraline seems to be very effective in blocking this reaction. I feel like myself again, thank God. I no longer have racing thoughts and all the physical reactions of panic. This is my second time taking it, first was for PPD and it helped then too. I did have side effects for the first 4-6 weeks, including dry mouth, insomnia, and a foggy out of it feeling, but it all lifted."
