"I too was excited at first to try it.  It was great the first month with the exception of very vivid dreams sometimes nightmares.  I would often wake crying.  i felt great but then reading these reviews, i find that my recent mood changes have been because of this medication.  I have been blaming PMS on everything but everything gets on my nerves, my dogs barking, the clicking of their nails on the floor, even my kids eating and of course my husband can&#039;t do anything right.  I was very pleased with the medication at first.  felt like a new person, but now i see that the way i have been feeling could be because of the Viibryd.  It didn&#039;t even dawn on me.  I wish I had read these reviews sooner. I am going to contact my doctor today"
