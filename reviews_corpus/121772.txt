"I&#039;ve tried many different SSRI&#039;s for depression (Zoloft, Wellbutrin, Prozac) and nothing worked.  I was apprehensive to take the Effexor because of online reviews but I&#039;m so glad I did!  The only side effect I&#039;ve had is tiredness the first few weeks but that has since subsided.  I not only feel more energy but I actually can feel happiness.  On the other medicines I just felt a numbness and lack of emotion but Effexor has made me feel like me again!  This has been my miracle after years of mild-severe depression."
