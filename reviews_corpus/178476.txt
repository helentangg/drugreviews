"I have been experiencing chronic fatigue (inability to muster up energy for anything) for as long as I can recall.  My doctor gave me a trial for Cymbalta for approximately two months and I noticed an improvement.  My mom had a stroke and I was away for a few weeks and unfortunately I ran out of my medication, so I thought I would be okay without it.  I was wrong!  I experienced major withdrawals after about two weeks.  I was easily agitated.  I did not leave my apartment.  I could not sleep.  Some nights I was up until 4:00AM.  Earlier in the week I went back on it and things seem to be slowly getting back on track. "
