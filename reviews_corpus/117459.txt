"I was tried on this for major depression. After 2 weeks on 50mg per night, I couldn&#039;t handle it any more. I ended up going to the ER because my heart was racing. I was at 125/130 beats per min. I&#039;d only been getting a few hours of sleep each night in those 2 weeks, and experienced the heart racing, brain short circuits, insomnia, anxiety, severe constipation, extreme thirst, and an overall feeling of disconnect from aliveness. 

As a teenager, I took Doxepin and Elavil too, and they were slightly better, but not much. These TCAs should be a last resort like Thorazine and Lithium. Seroquel is much better. Good luck to my fellow sufferers!"
