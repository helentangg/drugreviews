"I began taking 10mg Paxil when I was 28 (I am now 38) for panic attacks and stayed on it for around 6 years. I felt so good on it that I felt like I didn&#039;t need it anymore so I weened myself off of it with no problems!  After going through early menopause my Doctor put me on 50 mg of Zoloft, that worked well for my hot flashes and mood swings but when I began having panic attacks again the Zoloft did nothing.  My Doctor then increased the Zoloft to 100mg, it did nothing for my panic attacks only made me more nervous!  I am now taking 20 mg of Paxil. I am here to say that it has only been one week, but what a difference a week makes!  I feel like myself only a little tired. I have no other side effects and it gave me my life back!"
