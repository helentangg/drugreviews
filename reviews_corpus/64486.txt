"I have to say I was terrified of taking meds. I didn&#039;t know what was going on with me I had been feeling awfully for about 8 months. I finally went to see a doctor and was diagnosed with anxiety disorder. I feared medication, but my doctor talked me into trying it and I&#039;m glad I did. I will say there is side effects, but just keep taking it they will pass I&#039;ve been on zoloft since June 1st of this year and I feel so much better....So if your terrified don&#039;t be it&#039;s worth a try.."
