"Sertraline changed my life. My anxiety attacks began in the fall, and as a university student, there were little options or ways to cope without it affecting my studies and social life. I eventually stopped going to class, believing that there was going to be no solution. I began taking sertraline and even with a small dose (which eventually increased) I felt better. I almost feel better than I did before I was aware of my anxiety. I wasn&#039;t educated and was a non-believer thinking that medication could truly solve problems in your head but after finally listening and taking advice it did for me. May not work for everyone, but thought I would share my experience."
