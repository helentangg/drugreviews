"I took Paxil 20mg for 8 years. It is excellent for depression, anxiety and social anxiety. I completely lost all anxiety, shyness and experienced relaxed euphoria. I excelled at work and dealing with people. However it is very sedating, I would drink coffee all day while on it. I look back on those 8 years and it all seems like a blur.  Sleep very deeply and a lot but at least I was happy. I&#039;m now in my mid thirties and was recently switched to Celexa because I started finding it difficult to achieve orgasm on Paxil.  Bad decision...I now experience anxiety from the moment I wake up, shortness of breath, agoraphobia, terrible and obsessive thoughts, and racing thoughts and a feeling that I am going crazy. I&#039;m going back on Paxil."
