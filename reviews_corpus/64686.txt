"Hi people, I&#039;ve been following these comments for a couple months, they helped me so much. I had to write in about my experience with Zoloft 50mg for panic and anxiety.
First, you have to stick with it for ***8 weeks*** minimum. I had terrible side effects for 4 weeks, increased panic and anxiety and insomnia. I also lost 10 lbs, felt like my metabolism increased. At just about 4 weeks, side effects-gone. At 8 weeks I feel so relaxed and panic-free. It is AMAZING, wow. So this is what you are supposed to feel like! If you have a stressful job like me, I don&#039;t have time for anxiety and panic. I am also doing talk therapy and meditation. I sleep great..I do use medicinal herb for sleep every night. I am completely off of benzos!"
