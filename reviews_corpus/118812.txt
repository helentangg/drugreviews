"I just started taking Zoloft 3 days ago for general and social anxiety. I have experienced side effects that include headaches, discomfort in my chest, nausea, decrease in appetite, losing weight already. Sometimes it feels like my head is bound up. I used to get really tense while driving, but with the medicine I don&#039;t get tense, just alert. I haven&#039;t been back to school or work so I&#039;m not sure how effective it is for my social anxiety. I am now generally happy and I do not experience worrisome thoughts as much. It makes me tired and sometime I just pass out and wake up with insomnia.  I used to be very mean to my dog, I think he is seeing a difference in my behavior. I&#039;m hoping the symptoms become less. 50mg then 100mg."
