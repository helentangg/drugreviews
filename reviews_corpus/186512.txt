"I started taking Pristiq a year ago.  I am 57 year old female that went through a devastating divorce after 20 years of marriage.  The worst part was that he left me for my best friend.  They both work at the same employer that I do.  So it was very hard for me to return to work and see them both there.  I was severely depressed and really didn&#039;t want to be on this earth.  I have never taken antidepressants before.  My doctor put me on 50mg of Pristiq to help me through this time.  The first 3 days were great....someone could have died and I was smiling for the first time in a long time, and I wanted to be here!  I am just now weaning myself off Pristiq slowly with my Doctor&#039;s blessing.  So far no side effects."
