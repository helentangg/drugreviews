"First day taking it, at 8 pm , the medication peaks at 4 hours, so at midnight I looked in the mirror and my pupils were dilated I felt very jittery, I was unable to sleep, I felt a strange sensation creep up my body and to my head, hot flashes, it felt hot at 73 degrees. It wasn&#039;t all too bad I did feel a bit joyful and playful after I slowly forgot about the other effects. The second day same time same effects and I went to sleep. I woke up at 9 am on the dot. I again had a strange sensation overwhelm me I had vomiting and had a panic attack. I called my doctor and was advised to stop taking the medication . I did not respond well to this medication."
