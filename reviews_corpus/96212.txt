"Zoloft has been helpful as someone dealing with chronic pain and occasional anxiety. After trying a variety of different treatments and regimens, this seems to be the best long-term strategy to coping with anxiety. I realized a lot of things about myself after beginning Zoloft - the ability to process things before I react and the way that I handle stressful situations has changed for the better. I feel like a more balanced, calm person since starting about 7 months ago. It has helped with relationships too, as I am able to manage my stress and anxiety more around the people that I love. Felt a bit jittery and lost a few pounds while I first started, but the side effects were gone after 3 weeks. And for the record, I was completely opposed."
