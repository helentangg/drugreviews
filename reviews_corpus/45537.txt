"I have been put on fluoxetine twice. On the second time of taking it I suffered with all the stated side effects as my body got used to it. Infact I got worse for about two weeks. I would urge anyone feeling like this in the first 2-3 weeks of taking it to stick with it! I haven&#039;t suffered with any major side effects since my body got used to it but one sticks out. My dreams have become VERY long and vivid and I can recall them most nights. I wonder if anybody else has experienced this? Anyway if it&#039;s new to you and your unsure - keep going!"
