"I have been on this medication for 4 months now. It has been the first antidepressant to not only help with my everyday anxiety, depression and panic attacks but I have also had no side effects after taking it for the first month. I was overeating before I started with this medication and since I am no longer depressed all the time I have been able to lose some weight and get back to a more average weight for my height. I did have some sexual side effects throughout the first month but my body has adjusted and I no longer have those issues. I take this with Trazodone at bedtime and have also been sleeping a lot better since I started my medications. I would recommend giving it a try if you are dealing with anxiety or panic attacks."
