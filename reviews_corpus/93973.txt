"I took all sorts of meds to test with most horrible side effects.  Finally one day my doc had me try Trin 20 mg and my life changed. I read negative reviews and was scared but I have had no side effects except for some weight gain. I had a family member that got severely sick and I was by their bedside for 3 months though I would get depressed I never had a dark dip (you know what I&#039;m talking about) I bounced back quickly. I recommend trying this. Just try and in a week u will know. Drug is super expensive. Use coupon. Call the Pharma company.  see what happens... it may just change ur life. Oh... forgot to mention that I just started my own business after years of working for idiots getting fired. I doubt I could do this without this med."
