"So I finally gave in and started taking Escitalopram for my Anxiety. I&#039;ve been living with it for the last 12 years diagnosed at age 20. I&#039;m a healthy male, enjoy jogging and in general eat very healthy. I&#039;m taking Lamotragine (lamictal) for Bipolar disorder as well. 

I wouldn&#039;t say there was any tough phases for me to be honest. I&#039;m on day 7 now and all I&#039;ve had was some headaches after waking up that lasted till the afternoon. They subsided after the 3rd day. I haven&#039;t noticed any increase in anxiety or loss in sex drive yet either. I&#039;m looking forward to experience the full effect/benefits of this medication"
