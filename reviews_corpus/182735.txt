"I married a great man.  I put this man through hell . I&#039;m 34 was 32 had a hysterectomy and here came menopause. I was living hell.  I felt every bad feeling you could possibly feel. For no reason. Finally this Feb 2017 I snapped. I don&#039;t remember much other than trying to kill myself.  I almost lost my family. I reached out for help my Dr put me on 30mg then 60 now 120. The 1st day I felt brand new. My face was numb but that&#039;s it. Everything is brighter better warm and I have love in my ‚ù§   Thank you for saving me!"
