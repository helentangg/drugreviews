"I was prescribed paroxetine 10mgs for my panic disorder and OCD. I&#039;ve been on it about 1 month. At first I was really tired, could hardly stay awake and I couldn&#039;t eat because I felt nauseated, and at times I felt like my body was burning from the inside out. I almost felt like a zombie, just sat there, didn&#039;t smile, frown or laugh. Thought I was going crazy. How would I take care of my kids like this? I decided to keep taking it because I hadn&#039;t had a panic attack and having one frightened me to no end. After about 2 weeks I was able to get up and clean without being picky, ride in a car without being scared, we had some storms and I didn&#039;t panic, and I was playing with my kids again. The pros outweigh the cons! Thank you paroxetine."
