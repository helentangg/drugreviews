"Today was my first day using Lexapro. I have been put on a light dosage of 5mg/day. I don&#039;t know if it was just my wishful thinking or not but within a few hours I felt a little bit braver then usual. I felt like I could actually go into my local supermarket to do some shopping which I haven&#039;t done for over 2 years now. By the end of the day my brave thoughts had disappeared but it gave me hope that this treatment will work or at least help lower my anxiety. Keeping my fingers crossed."
