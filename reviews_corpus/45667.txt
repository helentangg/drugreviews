"I have been taking 20 mg of Prozac for about five years for my premenstrual dysphoric disorder.  It has changed my life and I will never quit taking it. Before, I was quick to fly off the handle.  Ironically, I dreaded weekends because my family stressed me out so much. I&#039;m embarrassed to admit was not a very pleasant employee/coworker.  I noticed a difference after about a month of taking it when I realized that I&#039;m a different person - for the better.  When I first started taking it I was waking up at about 4 am every morning but that has gone away.  I still don&#039;t always sleep very well but my understanding is that happens to everyone when they get older!"
