"I&#039;ve been taking sertraline (50mg) for over a month now. I felt slightly better after 3-3.5 weeks on the med, and I started feeling full effects after about a month. Now I feel great! Nevertheless, I experienced a considerable increase in anxiety and panic in the first week of taking sertraline. Other than that, I didn&#039;t notice any other side effects. I would highly recommend this to anyone suffering from Panic disorder, GAD and depression."
