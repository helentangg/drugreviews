"I&#039;m from the UK, and  have had severe migraine for the past 20 years. They have affected not only me but my family in many ways. I don&#039;t know how they put up with it really.  I have been taking 10mg at night for the past 3 months and apart from a little sleepiness in the morning it has transformed my life.  My migraines initially lessened in intensity to the extent that now I just feel very tired on the days when I would have had one - this I can cope with.  My regret is that I did not find out about this medicine sooner as I could have enjoyed my life and my children when they were younger more."
