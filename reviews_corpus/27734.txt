"For me and other people I have suggested this medication too it has completely changed our lives for the better. Reading reviews you often see knee jerk reactions from people suffering deeply and then taking the medication and going through the up to 4 week period of feeling worse. That is a tough 4 weeks if you felt you where already at breaking point, easy to pull out the pitch fork at that time.

But you&#039;re less likely to hear from the people who would tell you the polar opposite of that because once taking lexapro providing you are feeling better it&rsquo;s easy to leave the dark world behind and return to the light. 

My suggestion to anyone who has been recommended this, ignore stigma and try this for at least 4 weeks at your doctors direction. GL ML"
