"Amitriptyline made a huge difference to my daily life in terms of pain relief from Vulvodynia, but it has many side effects.  I stuck to a low level 25mg and had to wiegh up benefits vs side-effects.  Changed to Nortriptyline and had the same benefits but less side-effects.  Now take 30mg of Nortriptyline."
