"Like many who have commented here, I have experienced almost total relief from recurring migraine headaches - due to cranial nerve inflammation stemming from arthritis in C4 and C5.  Before I started the amitriptyline, I had a strong headache nearly 24/7 with crushing flares maybe 2x per week.  I was treating them with NSAIDs and Tramadol to keep them under control, with a &#039;triptan&#039; for the flares.  My doctor put me on a regimen involving titration from 50mg up to 300mg over a 5-week period.  I only got to 150mg before the side effects (lethargy, dry mouth, constipation) were too much for me.  I have backed down to 50mg before bed and that is working pretty well.  My quality of life is SO much better. You&#039;ll get used to the side effects."
