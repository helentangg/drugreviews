"I took it for 2 weeks. Started 75mg first week and went up to 150mg the second. Several days after I increased the dosage, I lost all sex potency and sex drive completely. I&#039;m a 25 year old man and I was not able to orgasm at all.

After I stopped I have VERY SEVERE withdrawal symptoms. I had to lose work for several days and was very close to being sent to a hospital.

At NO POINT did my doctor warn me of any of these symptoms.

It&#039;s very important to understand that this drug is that this drug CAN cause permanent damage and that it is highly addictive even after a short time.

I&#039;d rather take a bullet to my head than take this pill ever again."
