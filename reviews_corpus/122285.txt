"I have been dealing with major depression roughly 10 years. Have been on a medley of antidepressants and different combos. Most being SSRI&#039;s that seem useless or worsen my depression. Emsam is by far the most effective. I have little if no episodes of suicidal thoughts anymore and life just seems more  managable.this drug actually has promise instead of the many other antidepressants that are just all hype. Definitely worth a try."
