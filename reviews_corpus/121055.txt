"I only took this drug for 4 days because the side effects for me were too much. The first day I was extremely restless. I woke up having a panic attack which has never happened to me before. Though I will say this one may be coincidence. Day two I noticed a drop in my visual acuity. It wasn&#039;t too bothersome this day. But on day three it had declined in my right eye to the point where I had difficulty reading. When I closed my right eye everything seemed normal but when I closed my left eye everything was extremely blurry. I&#039;ve never had vision problems before and this was starting to effect my work. My eyes are very dry as well. Been off for four days and nothing&#039;s changed but I expect that to take time."
