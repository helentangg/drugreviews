"Have been using sertraline (generic version) for about a week. I take it at night, but still have troubles calming my mind enough to sleep. Actually the nights are bad..have nausea, no desire for sex at ALL, a general grey, blah feeling. Kind of like boredom, only nothing can snap me out of it but in the morning, I can wake up, go about my day, smile for the first time in a very long time. My family and friends have noticed a huge change in my mood, my appearance, everything. The only bad part is trying to convince myself that I need to eat. The nausea is just too overpowering sometimes but yes, still like it, still will keep taking it."
