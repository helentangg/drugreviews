"I&#039;ve taken this medication for a year and a half after switching from Zoloft (that wasn&#039;t helping at all) and while Lexapro somewhat improved my anxiety I haven&#039;t seen a major difference. I still get anxiety attacks every now and then and get depressed to the point I cry a lot. I personally find xanax  to work much better for my anxiety but everyone is different."
