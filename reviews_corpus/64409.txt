"I had to start off at a very low dose, 12.5mg.  Starting at anything higher made me feel like I was having a heart attack.  Gradually increasing by just 12.5 mg for dose increases were much kinder.  My mind is becoming more clear and focused, my thoughts dont seem so cluttered, and I have a little room for improvement so far.  I target between 75-100 mg for feeling my best.

Typical warned side effects (GI upset) is as expected but with each small increase, resolves.

Sticking with it! :)"
