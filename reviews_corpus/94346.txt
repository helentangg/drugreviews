"Been on Brintellix 10 MG for 1 month, at the same time decreasing Lexapro and Wellbutrin. Noticed immediate decline. Felt like I was not on meds at all. Increased to 20 MG. Felt angry, had uncontrollable emotional outbursts. Now on Xanax. When I feel loopy, angry, anxious I take it but am so out of it. I feel horrible and out of my mind. The genetic test said that Brintellix would be good for me but I can&#039;t function properly."
