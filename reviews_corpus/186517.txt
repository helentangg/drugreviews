"I took this medicine two days ago. The first day I took it around 8pm and couldn&#039;t fall asleep until 3am. I also experienced clenching my teeth that night and it made me so irritable. I noticed my stomach making funny sounds and I took it with a full glass of water and with food  The next morning I woke up with a horrible headache. I had an upset stomach and my jaw was so sore. I felt very nauseated and that passed after about three hours. Around 3pm I took it again since I knew it kept me up. I hardly ate at all that day due to feeling so sick. Around 7pm I felt like I might be hungry. I went to get fries. When I ate the fries they tasted different.  Pristiq made me so sick and made stuff taste different. "
