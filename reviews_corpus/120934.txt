"I am on day 3 of venlafaxine (37.5mg) for hot flashes.  I quit HRT a year ago at age 63 and began horrible and frequent hot flashes and haven&#039;t slept well in a year.  On this med, day 1 I felt some nausea but the intensity of flashes was greatly reduced.  On day 2, nausea went away but I was super sleepy.  Today is day 3 and I have no side effects.  The hot flashes happen less frequently and with way less intensity.  My doctor says to wait a week or two and things will continue to improve.  So pleased with this medication!  And the generic was only $8 for 30 pills."
