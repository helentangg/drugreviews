"Tried Viibryd about 3 years ago after trying several other anti-depressants over many years, with very little long-term benefit from any of them (Prozac, Lexapro...) After being on it for about 2 months, I forgot to take it one night, and had the worst nightmare of my life; the impact was more like a vision or prophesy. Decided after that to wean myself off, and cut pills in half. For each time I cut the dose, there was another horrendous nightmare. Was very relieved to be done with it."
