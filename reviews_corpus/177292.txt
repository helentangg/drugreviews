"Prior to the intro of Cymbalta (about 2004?), I had tried MAOIs, trycyclics, Prozac, Zoloft, Effexor, Wellbutrin, multi-drug cocktails and 20 rounds of ECT for recurring bouts of major depression. I attempted suicide, flatlined in the ambulance on the way to a hospital, but somehow lived.  A couple years later, I was prescribed 120 mg of Cymbalta (at the time, that was twice the recommended dose) and gradually tapered off 5 other drugs.  Almost immediately I began to feel better and, gradually over the next year of so, returned to my &#039;normal&#039; self.  I never thought that would happen.  Since then, 40 mg of Adderall was added to help combat fatigue.  Life has been good ever since. Cymbalta may not be the 1 for you, but don&#039;t give up."
