"At 37 I was woken in the night by my first panic attack, I dialed 911. For 4 months I&#039;ve been crippled with 24-7 severe anxiety accompanied with 2-4 panic attacks a day. Looking back I&#039;ve had GAD my whole life but a stressful event finally brought it to the surface. After 3 months I sought a psychiatrist and today is day 14 on generic Lexapro (Escitalopram.) I began on 5mg and yesterday was increased to 7.5. Within 9 days I noted improvment but I had bad side effects. I made myself hang on and today I can tell you IT WORKS! I have a ways to go and will update as I progress but this medicine meant life or death to me and has in 14 days allowed me to care for myself and my kids again. Push through the side effects and give it time! It works!"
