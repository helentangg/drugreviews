"I tried this medication for the first time for depression a few years back and it really didn&#039;t agree with me. Woke up in the middle of the night in a complete panic crawling out of my own skin, heart racing sheer terror. I&#039;m a nurse and I know this drug works for some people but if you are sensitive to side effects I would be careful of this one as it is a combination antidepressnt. Needless to say I never took another Effexor again and really wished I was warned of how bad the effects of this one could be."
