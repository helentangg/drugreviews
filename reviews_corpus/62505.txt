"I have been taking 20mg every evening for about 2 months and a few days ago upped the dose to 40mg. I couldn&#039;t be happier with this medication. I had very few side effects in the beginning (frequent yawning, tiredness, lack of concentration). Those all went away within 2 weeks and I was afraid they would come back with the increased dosage but they haven&#039;t. I don&#039;t feel like an emotionless zombie while taking Celexa, I feel happy when I should and sad when I should, like a normal human being. It has really helped with my crying for no reason spells, as well as helping me deal with frustrations better. I wish I found out about this medication sooner."
