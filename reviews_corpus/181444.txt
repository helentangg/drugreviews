"I finally had the guts to mention my depression to my doctor, Thank God!  I was depressed for years and was at the point of uncontrollable crying, missing work because of it.  This was not the wife and mother I wanted to be so I finally asked for help.  It has changed my life.  No more depression and many things that used to cause me stress bother me much less or not at all.  Not many side effects except fatigue, appetite loss, and a spacey feeling that only lasted a few days.  Please don&#039;t wait to ask for help.  I wish I had done this long ago."
