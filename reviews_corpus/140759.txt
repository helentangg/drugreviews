"I switched from Effexor to Lexapro after I was beginning to have suicidal thoughts. While my mood improved, my sex drive plummeted. On top of that, I gained 25lbs in a month. After completely changing my diet and exercise routine by suggestion of my doctor, I still hadn&#039;t lost any of the weight. It began to chip at what little self esteem I had, and my mood began to plummet again. It&#039;s hard to feel happy when you feel so uncomfortable with your body after a rapid weight change. I&#039;ve been switched to Welbutrin SR, so we&#039;ll see how that goes."
