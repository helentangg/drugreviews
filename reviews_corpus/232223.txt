"I&#039;ve been on Paxil for about two months. The first two weeks I was on 10mg, and I could feel a big change. My pupils would dilate huge, which I read was because my brain was finally being flooded with serotonin. I actually would relate the side effects I felt as similar to MDMA (I spent from 19-23 as an avid drug user..have been clean now for 4 years). I felt awesome, but it didn&#039;t last. Two weeks in, my doctor increased my dose to 20mg. Since the increase, the &quot;good feeling&quot; has kind of went away. I feel how I did before I started Paxil, PLUS it&#039;s hard to think clearly&amp;feels like something is pressing on my chest at night. I have absolutely no sex drive and have lost more than 20lbs due to not eating. It&#039;s done nothing for my anxiety yet."
