"Been battling depression for over 10 years. I have had a lot of stress and strain in my life. I take drugs and come off them when I feel better. So I am inconsistent with treatment. I have tried Fluoxetine, citalapram and sertraline. I am trying to take 50mg of sertraline per day. However, for me sertraline helps with my anxiety to a point, but the insomnia has been dreadful. I awake in the middle of the night. Poor sleep. Then want to sleep in day as can&#039; t cope with no sleep. The body needs to recover during sleep. If I don&#039;t get this I become paranoid. I feel sertraline 50 mg for me has been poor experience. I am currently in process of weaning off. I may go back to citalapram as this was the best drug for me. We are all different. Xx"
