"I&#039;ve been on paroxetine for a little over 3 months. My Dr told me I wouldn&#039;t see a difference in my hot flashes from this medicine until at least 2 months. My hot flashes are fierce. I get drenched at least 10 Times at night. And all through the day. I told my Dr I wanted something to work right away, so he gave me clonidine along with it, which I wasn&#039;t able to take, cause it made me to sleepy. Anyway, the praxetine did work after 2 months, as long as I don&#039;t drink alcohol."
