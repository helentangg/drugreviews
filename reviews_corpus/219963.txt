"I am currently 16 years old, and have chronic nerve pain in my left arm- it has been 2 years so far. The doctors did basically nothing until now because my insurance (state insurance) was having them go through all kinds of hoops. Finally I was sent to pain management in the recent month, and from there I was prescribed amitriptyline hcl. I&#039;ve found so far, after taking this medication for almost a week, 10mg 30 mins before I go to bed, that I&#039;ve been having intense headaches, but only in my right side of my brain, along with sinus pressure and extreme drowsiness. I literally have slept an entire 19 hours! Normally I only sleep from 10pm to 6am, so sleeping this long is insane.
So far it hasn&#039;t helped with my pain either... :("
