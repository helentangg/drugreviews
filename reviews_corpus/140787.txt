"I&#039;ve had anxiety for many years and my Dr had me on Xanax for about 12 years...3 times a day (0.25mg). She weaned me off to only taking 1 at night. While weaning she put me on 5mgs of lexapro to ease the process which was over a year ago and I still take the lexapro however, lately I have been experiencing more frequent panic/anxiety attacks which causes major dizziness more so than before. I&#039;m not sure if Lexapro is for me or if the mgs is too low. I&#039;ll be making an appt to see my Dr but I want to see if anyone out there has had or is having this problem. It&#039;s pretty scary."
