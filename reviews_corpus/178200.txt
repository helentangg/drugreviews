"My neurologist recommended this for my peripheral neuropathy.  I took it (60 mg) only once because it made me nauseated, dizzy, shaky, and sleepy.  I could not keep my eyes open.  I realize that this might get better if I keep taking it, but I have to work and there is no way I can do that with these side effects.  It did work, however.  Just this one dose made the pain much more bearable for two days."
