"Tonight will be my fourth time taking Silenor. The last few nights I have not had a solid sleep. No problem falling asleep but staying asleep is still impossible. First two nights I had very lucid dreams. Waking up only after a couple of hours as I normally do. I&#039;m only taking 3mg, kind of scared to take 6mg. I&#039;ve taken many other types of sleeping pills and so far, none of them work. I&#039;d give anything for a solid 6-8 hours."
