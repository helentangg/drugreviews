"Started having pain, continuous in gall bladder area, felt as if I had a spider running under my skin and caused pain in a localized area. After several visits to several doctors, a digestive Doctor explained to me that prolonged stress could cause a localized pain in the body that was not found medically. Have taken anti-depressants on/off for 12 years. Stopped those and started nortriptyline 10mg at night. The spiders stopped crawling completely during the day, so the pain associated with it stopped. I take this 10mg only at night, within 15mins off to bed I go and sleep through the whole night. Could not imagine taking during the day. Overall, the medication has stopped the pain and this causes my day to be much more productive."
