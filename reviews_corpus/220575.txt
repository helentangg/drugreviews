"I&#039;ve had Interstitial Cystitis for a little over 6 years. In the beginning, I tried all sorts of things - hydraulic distention of the bladder, Elmiron, all different kinds of prescriptions - nothing helped. Eventually I read about Elavil online and asked my doctor about it. He put me on it 4 years ago and I&#039;ve been on it ever since. It is the ONLY medicine that has helped. I take 20mg a night. I also take Desert Harvest Aloe pills - 2 every morning - more when I flare up. I have occasional flares (like right now I am in one)), but for the most part, my Interstitial Cystitis has been under control for the past 2.5 years. 
Side effects - In the beginning, it made me very tired. Also caused me to gain about 30-35 lbs, but I&#039;ll take it over IC pain."
