"I got a migraine that lasted for 15 days straight. Finally, my mom suggested that maybe they were stress related because I had had several huge events happen in a short amount of time (got married, graduated from college, and started a job nannying 5 young children).  I finally went to the doctor and he put me on amitriptyline.  I take 25mg every night before bed. I have been taking it for a month, and have only had one migraine, which occurred 3 days after I started taking the medication. Occasionally I notice drowsiness in the morning, I have to get quite a bit of sleep for it to wear off, which I&#039;m completely fine with. I haven&#039;t noticed any other side effects. It&#039;s AMAZING!"
