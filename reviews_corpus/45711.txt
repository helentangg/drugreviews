"If it wasn&#039;t for Prozac SSRI, I wouldn&#039;t be able to function normally; probably just lie in bed and not know what to do... Long story short, this drug is a God send. I&#039;m not even on a high dose but I can feel that it&#039;s helping me get back on my feet and live. My goal is that this will help not only live again, but stronger."
