"I&#039;ve been on viibryd for over 4 years, 20mg. After being a zombie for 4 years bc of depression, followed by two years as a robot on Prozac, viibryd has been a miracle for me. Reading the other reviews, especially the negative ones, has been mind boggling, but goes to show how different everyone is. It took about 4 months for it to work on me. My partner was also on Prozac then viibryd, is on 40mg viibryd right now and he had an immediate change. Sexually we are the same: he has no dysfunction, and I&#039;m as sensitive as ever. Sexual drive the same. No serious side effects. A few years back I woke up in a very soaked bed, sweating. I went to the doctor and my MD recommended I take viibryd in PM not AM. Month later, back to AM and fine since!!"
