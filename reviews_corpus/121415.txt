"I was suffering from hot flashes, night sweats, and irritability - symptoms of menopause.  The hot flashes were happening several times a day and were becoming unbearable.  My doctor recommended Venlafaxine since I had a strong history of breast cancer in my family.  The hot flashes disappeared the day I began taking the medication!  My only side effects were a lot of yawning (which lasted about a year).  About 6 months after beginning the medication, the hot flashes began to return (although not as often as before).  My doctor increased the dose and I have been fine for over a year now.  This medication really works for me!  My husband loves it too because he says I&#039;m back to my &quot;old self&quot; again - not irritable!"
