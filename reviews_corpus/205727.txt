"Started on Pristiq after my dad passed away two years ago, and I was to the point I couldn&#039;t handle life.  It was great; I was happy, I could cope, I didn&#039;t gain too much weight (a little maybe, but I wasn&#039;t &quot;obsessed&quot; with food). My sex drive was pretty much gone though.  Because of lack of sex drive, and sudden migraines, I went off it after a year.  Tried to start taking it again, and it just wasn&#039;t working anymore.  The number one thing I would warn people about is that it&#039;s really hard to stop taking this medication. The side effects with the withdrawals are brain shocks, depression, blurry vision, confusion, exhaustion.  "
