"Started taking Lexapro about a year ago. Made me so tired I couldn&#039;t function. Felt like a zombie, would sleep for 2-3 hours every afternoon (not normal for me)...then started having &quot;breakthrough&quot; anxiety attacks. I also suffer from obsessive compulsive disorder. Doctor switched me to 20 mg Prozac and life became better. My OCD became manageable, anxiety attacks became almost obsolete. I decided I didn&#039;t need it anymore so I stopped taking it. I am now going through a divorce and custody battle (unrelated issues) and my anxiety attacks are very bad. I have resumed taking Prozac in hopes of better days. Day 4 now and have only had 1 attack. Fingers crossed."
