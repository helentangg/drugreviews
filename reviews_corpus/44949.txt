"I&#039;m 51 and premenopausal- for a few days each month around ovulation, I&#039;d go from my normal self to an &quot;Eeyore&quot; state....the smallest things could set me off into an increasingly downward spiral of depression. When I finally told my amazing doctor about this, he explained that if it was truly PMDD and menopausal related, a very very small dose of Prozac for just a few days per month would help the problem tremendously. If it was actual depression, it would not work so well or so quickly. He was absolutely right! I am only using 5 mg, which is a dose so small that I have to get a 10 mg pill and break it in half. I take it for approx 3 days. It&#039;s critical that I take it at the very first sign of that depression before it is able to take root."
