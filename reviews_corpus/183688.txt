"I&#039;ve been on Cymbalta for about a year now. I was taking it for depression and anxiety disorder along with other medications. About 6 months ago I became severely depressed and suicidal. I was put on two more different drugs for mood stabilization. Nothing would help. My doctor did not once tell me that the Cymbalta could be the cause of my increased depression. I finally was taken of the Cymbalta and put on a new drug 6 days ago. Barely 24 hours after the Cymbalta was out of my system my suicidal thoughts and severe depression was almost completely depleted. "
