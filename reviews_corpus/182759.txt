"Several days after starting cymbalta I started having energy and no pain.  I was so elated. Who cares if you sweat a river?  Who cares if you can&#039;t go outside from May through sept?  After taking it for several years I began to slowly turn from my dream to a night mare.  I sweated all year and was hot in the winter as well.  Everyone was freezing and I was hot and didn&#039;t want the heat running.  I gained 40 pounds but all the symptoms returned.  I finally weaned down to 30 mg then cold turkey. I have now been totally off cymbalta for 25 days and have gained 10 more lbs.  I can&#039;t even buy clothes big enough because my stomach looks 9 months pregnant. My thighs are as big as a professional football player."
