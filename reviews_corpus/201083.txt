"HELLO world, Writing a review cause &#039;Im just like you scrolling thru, I wanted to share my experience with this medicine, first things first this DOES NOT work right away it takes about a month or two For me at least to kick in, so do not stop after like a week unless you have horrible side effects. I satrted from 20mg all the way to 100mg. Helps a lot with S.A , G.A.D and depression, and as well as Agoraphobia Panic attacks are gone, Still get anxious but a normal nervousness not overwhelming, no more crying spells.. This Medicine won&#039;t Cure Mental Illness but it definitely HELPS! %u2764%u2764%u2764%u2764&quot; Give it a Try, &amp; always keep ya head up! ! if it doesn&#039;t work you can always keep trying other SSRI&#039;s that will help your everyday life!"
