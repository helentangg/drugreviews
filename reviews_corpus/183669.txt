"For me, this worked great as pain relief for a herniated disc. I found the pain to be less agonizing throughout the day, and I could do things that I needed to (cleaning, vacuuming, grocery shopping, carrying the groceries, etc.).  The problem that I had with the medication is that I had horrible memory loss.  I am a full-time student and could not handle the problems I had trying to retain hard information.  My doctor tried to combat this by putting me on Ritalin but then I couldn&#039;t sleep.  I have had to go off of pain relievers for this exact problem."
