"So I was put on duloxetine over 1 year ago. This was after I had tried about 3 different anti-depression medication that didn&#039;t help. I was first put on 30mg that made me slightly better but I stall felt constantly sad with no energy to do things . So then they increased the dose . Now I&#039;m on 60mg. I have to say the drug saved my life , after years of constant suicidal thoughts and trying to harm myself I no longer feel the need to . I wouldn&#039;t say it makes you feel happy , it just makes you content . I have been rather lucky and not had to many side effects . I am quite tired but than I do think that&#039;s depression not the tablets .  It&#039;s a great medicine to take but if you miss a day or come off it&#039;s like hell . Like depression has engulfed you entirely."
