"I&#039;ve been taking Brintellix for 2 months. I&#039;ve been on several other antidepressants: Wellbutrin, Effexor, Viibryd, and Pristique. Brintellix is the only medication that has sustainably improved my mood without causing fogginess or terrible side effects. My concentration has improved, my energy is consistent, my anxiety and agitation are greatly reduced, and I&#039;m happy. The first month I was very tired. Sleeping about 10-11 hours a night and still having trouble getting up in the morning. This has passed and I&#039;m back to a normal sleeping schedule and energy level. I experience nausea from certain foods/drinks. For example, coffee. Other side effects I&#039;m experiencing are constipation and weight gain. The pros still greatly outweigh the cons."
