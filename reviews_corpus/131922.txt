"I am 18 years old and started Effexor 3 months ago for anxiety. It has given me my life back, I used to have a hard time even leaving the house, now I enjoy life. I haven&#039;t been this happy in a long time. I don&#039;t think I would ever quit taking it. The first week I had the shakes, felt nausea, had headaches and had no appetite. The side effects went away and now I don&#039;t have any at all. I am so grateful, its changed my life for the better."
