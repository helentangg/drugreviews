"Best result thus far with no side effects. Was shocked at diagnosis of MDD, but Brintellix has been most effective in helping me feel like myself with interest in life again. Had been on Lexapro forever - stopped working. Tried Effexor 1 day - it had to go as between crying &amp; other adverse effects I just wanted to crawl in a hole &amp; hide forever. I&#039;m so glad my Dr. prescribed Brintellix as I haven&#039;t felt better in a long time - really thought I was going crazy."
