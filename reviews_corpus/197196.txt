"I experienced severe postpartum depression after my twins were born, actually it started after I stopped breastfeeding them.  My hormones were all over the place.  I was sleep deprived and suicidal.  Paxil worked great on my depression, but I had negative side effects. First of all, it really flattened my emotional response.  Nothing much upset me, but nothing made me excited either.  I had zero sex drive and could not achieve orgasm at all.  I also gained a lot of weight in a very short amount of time.  Also, I had trouble falling asleep.  I switched to Wellbutrin, and actually lost weight. I would still have difficulty coping some days, but it was manageable, and no negative side effects."
