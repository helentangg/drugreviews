"I&#039;ve been taking 20mg of citalopram for over 3 months now and I notice quite a difference in my depression. 3 months ago I was crying almost everyday, often multiple times a day. I had no motivation, was not enjoying life and wanted it to be over. Now I no longer cry for no reason, have more motivation and am enjoying life a lot more. Some days I still feel depressed but I have way more good days than bad days which is great. I haven&#039;t noticed any side effects, although sometimes I feel like I am almost &quot;too happy&quot;. I guess I haven&#039;t been eating as much either but I would consider that a good thing as I was eating my emotions previously."
