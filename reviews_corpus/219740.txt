"I started having head pains on the right side of my head/neck/eye after the loss of a loved one. Sharp pains and long lasting dull ache on the right side wouldn&#039;t go away, sometimes numbness etc. And for about a year I went through EVERY type of Dr &amp; test possible.  Long story short and two MRI&#039;s later (all came back normal). I was no closer to ridding myself of these pains. I found a new Dr who put me on Elavil (25mg) and I can say after 3 months my head pains are reduced 85%. I have pain free days now! It took about 2 months to work in my case. Tiredness is a side effect but mine went away after a few weeks. This med has given me hope. I hope if you&#039;re having these problems you will give it a chance to work..."
