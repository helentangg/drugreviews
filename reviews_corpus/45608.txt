"I went on fluoxetine 40mg when I was 18 for Depression and Anxiety and it initially worked wonders. I lost 5kg, it cleared my skin up and gave me a glow I had not had in years. My mood picked up heaps and I felt amazing. On the down side, it caused severe migraines and insomnia to the point I would sleep 30minutes a night. I came switched to citalopram and have recently been anti-depressant free for 6 months. I am going to go back onto fluoxetine as it really worked for me and will see how the side effects go round 2."
