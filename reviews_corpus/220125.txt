"So I was prescribed 25 mg initially I slept like the dead and saw a reduction in migraines though had low energy that wore off after about 3 weeks .. So did the reduction in migraines in 5 months I gained over 20lbs which very carefully watching my diet so definitely not for me ... On the upside it significantly reduced my anxiety and stabilized my mood ... I would have definitely stayed on it just for that if it wasn&#039;t for the weight gain."
