"I&#039;m a 35 y/o army combat veteran. I have PTSD &amp; one of my biggest challenges is the ANXIETY &amp; PANIC ATTACKS. I was discharged when i was 25, but the anxiety has gotten worse. I can&#039;t go into a market, target, mall or even outside when its very sunny. Apparently any stimuli triggers a panic attack for me.
I wish that I had the experiences you guys have with sertraline. I took it for 3 days &amp; it was absolutely unbearable. I was super jittery. I had bad tremors. My hands &amp; fingers could not stay still. I could not sleep. I got mild lockjaw (especially when I yawned). It was horrible. 
&bull;&bull;&bull;BUT&bull;&bull;&bull; 
Somehow I did not suffer from any panic attacks whatsoever. 
My Dr. took me off that &amp; put me on mirtazapine. Ugh. I need help, seriously."
