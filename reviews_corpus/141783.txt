"Well I have to say I have be debating on trying this medicine. Then I gathered up enough nerve to try it and, 1st night I took did not sleep very well and the following day I just felt so out of it, It was caused for concern at my job. I can honestly say, in my case the side effects are far more worse than my anxiety."
