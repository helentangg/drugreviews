"Celexa does get rid of anxiety, however, it also destroys the rest of your life.  The should call it the boner killer, because you will never get an erection as long as you take celexa.  And its tough to call yourself a man if your junk isn&#039;t working.  That leads to depression.  So right now I am in a tough spot.  Go back to anxiety, or stay depressed?  I don&#039;t feel like this throwing darts type treatment is good.  Either something works or it doesn&#039;t.  In my opinion, if the side effect are worse than the problem, drug doesn&#039;t work."
