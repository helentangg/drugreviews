"I have been on Venlafaxine up to 225 mg a day!-for almost 15 years..In July 2015 I began feeling very low and having great episodes of anxiety-I had a panic attack for the very first time in my life and bagan to realise the medication was no longer effective- I was referred to a Specialist depression drug consultant-I described my lack of energy and low mood -He thought I would benefit from introducing 50mg alongside the 150mg of Venlafaxine-So this is what I did- and felt wonderful-Until My GP said I Should taper the Venlafaxine off-I am now taking only the Sertraline 50mg-I am like a zombie- all I want to do is sleep-I crashed my car (15 years no claims) and have zero motivation-I will give it until the end of January and re consult the GP"
