"I&#039;ve just started taking Lexapro 10mg 4 days ago.  I have the normal headaches, some nausea, but I also feel restlessness.  I do not feel like I&#039;m crawling out of my skin, but I feel like I can&#039;t sit still and I have some odd pain in my legs.  It isn&#039;t cramping or sharp pains per say. It almost feels like a warm sensation.  I also feel maybe a bit more anxiety as of now.  Is the restlessness and feeling in my legs normal.  I wouldn&#039;t say it is intolerable, just annoying. Should I continue through the first week? I know I can call my doctor and I plan to, but I would like to see if anyone else has experienced these side effects and if they subsided."
