"I suffer from depression and anxiety. I was on a number of meds before my doctor put me on Lexapro.. they were all horrible and made my anxiety worse. I was starting to lose hope that I would never find a medication to help. Thankfully Lexapro is helping! It&#039;s a lifesaver!! I could tell a difference after the first day..I&#039;m much more &quot;normal&quot; I don&#039;t fly into a rage so easily, I don&#039;t feel overwhelmed constantly and I&#039;m not irritated all the time for no reason. My moods are much more stable. Before Lexapro I seriously felt like I was losing it. My husband even told me he notices a huge difference in me since being on this. I&#039;m also prescribed klonopin for my anxiety but since being on Lexapro I haven&#039;t had a need to take it. I love Lexapro!"
