"If you scroll down a bit to 2014, you will find my rave review of Prozac for OCD  and more than 100 people found it useful as well which is great.

Now it&#039;s 2016, a year and a half later and I went from 115 lbs (I NEVER struggled with weight) to 151 lbs today and I&#039;m just 5&#039;2&quot;.   My diet did NOT change.  In fact I battled anorexia in my teens.  I just don&#039;t enjoy food that much and still don&#039;t.  I truly believe some people may eat more, but ultimately it messes with your thyroid and hormones bad.

So, this is what I&#039;ll say:  Prozac is pure genius and DOES work very, very well.  You will probably lose weight in the first few months, and then as you approach a year the weight comes on fast and hard."
