"I&#039;ve had migraines for ten years now (from the age of 16) which increased in severity to the point that I was rushed to hospital with a suspected stroke. I started on amitriptyline 5mg once a day which reduced the severity of the migraines but didn&#039;t stop them altogether. I was advised that I could increase this to 20mg a day and since then (4 months) have been migraine free. "
