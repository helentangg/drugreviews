"I began taking venaflaxine to help cope with diabetic issues when diagnosed with Type II.  I do think it helps control anxiety and anger control. It certainly causes some side effects. Dizziness and light-headedness for me are the worst. Particularly if I let too much time elapse before taking the daily dose of 75 mg it does cause blurred vision intermittently and nausea if I turn my head too quickly. I also can no longer lie on my back and change oil or work on things while lying down without immediate nausea. I have soaked the sheet and pillow many times as well.  Been on the medication for 3 years."
