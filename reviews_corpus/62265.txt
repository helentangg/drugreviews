"I have suffered with depression and anxiety for the past five years. Gained almost 100lbs due to emotional eating and no energy to work out.  I have tried Zoloft and Paxil and I stopped because I felt numb. Not depressed anymore but not happy or even content.....just numb.  Just a month ago I started taking 10mg of Celexa and I finally feel like my old self.  Suddenly I&#039;m interested in things again and I&#039;m not suffering from negative thoughts racing in my brain.  I am hopeful and I have confidence that I can handle situations like I used to.  I hated leaving my house, almost as much as I hated being left alone with my children. Now all is calm."
