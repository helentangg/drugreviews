"Was given the starter pack from the Doctor, took three days worth was nauseous/diarrhea every day, then I got the flu couldn&#039;t keep anything down, so I quit taking it.  Started back on 40mg (Doctors choice) and had nausea/diarrhea again.   I only took it a few days because my stomach was cramping all the time and I was constantly in the bathroom.  Back to the Doctor on Friday, he is just going to have to give me something else."
