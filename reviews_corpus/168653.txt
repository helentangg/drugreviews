"Im 37 y/o female and was prescribed this after a suicide attempt. Took just a few days but I feel the best that I have in a very long time. I can&#039;t tell you the last time I had the energy, enthusiasm, or Clarity that I have now. I&#039;ve been on so many different antidepressants &amp; anti-anxiety medications that I&#039;ve lost track of what all I have been on. Best medication in combination with 5 milligrams of Abilify!!! I feel like I am getting my life back. I truly feel like my life has been saved. I did have loose bowels off and on the first two weeks, but now on week 3 it is getting better. My guess is, like any other antidepressant, some people respond in a positive way, and others respond in a negative way. Nature of the beast of depression!"
