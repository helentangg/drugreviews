"I&#039;ve struggled with GAD, social anxiety, depression issues since I was 15. Lets just say I get easily nervous. I am now 27 as I type this ,and let me just say I&#039;ve tried every single antidepressant out there. This one has really worked for me it boosted my mood. I&#039;m more social. I don&#039;t do anything socially awkward around new people anymore. And I keep losing a lot of weight even though I&#039;m very active. So that&#039;s a plus!"
