"been on sertraline now for about 18 months after my anxiety was turning into panic attacks. I was really bad, i couldn&#039;t sleep for constant fear of not waking up-id have 2-3 panic attacks EVERY DAY. i very very rarely have them any more and even if i start, i seldom get a bad one. The medication has stopped the attacks and lessened the anxiety. im still an anxious person but i can live my life now. It&#039;s given me heart burn but i have omeprazole now for that. the sertraline does not make you happy, but it makes you not anxious/sad which is good. overall im very happy, just wish i felt &#039;normal&#039; but ah well eh? :P"
