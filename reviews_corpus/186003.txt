"I&#039;m not a doctor, but I want everyone who&#039;s reading this to know: EVERYONE REACTS DIFFERENTLY TO MEDICINE. Pristiq didn&#039;t work for me, unfortunately. I was on the lowest Mg. It didn&#039;t do anything when I took it, but man...when I didn&#039;t take it...it was like I was having an &quot;out of body experience.&quot; It was the weirdest feeling. Not like a &quot;cool&quot; high. It was uncomfortable and annoying. I kept taking it in hopes of it helping my suicidal thoughts, and major anxiety. Now, all antidepressants CAN increase suicidal thoughts. Pristiq definitely increased these bad thoughts. I threw up before work (anxiety) &amp; was always a nervous wreck. I&#039;m off the medicine now. Going back to the doctors to talk about other options. God bless all of you."
