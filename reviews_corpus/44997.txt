"I started taking fluoxetine in April for social anxiety/OCD.  I was hooked on drugs for 4 years that&#039;s what caused it. I&#039;ve been sober for 2 years but unfortunately my mind didn&#039;t repair itself. I felt a difference with my anxiety straight away. But it took 6 weeks for it to really start working fully . I kept thinking in that first 6 weeks that I should have kept upping the dose because at times it didn&#039;t feel like it was working. But exactly 6 weeks in. Big difference in how I was feeling . Basically no anxiety at all. Highly recommend this medication and I had hardly any side effects. I tried Zoloft years ago and the side effects were terrible. Fluoxetine is much much better. Stick with it . It&#039;s worth it"
