"So I was previously on citalopram and it reduced my depression but made my pmdd more noticable. A psychiatrist recommended prozac as citalopram is not effective for pmdd. The month that they weaned me off citalopram and onto prozac was HELL.
 Now I&#039;m fully taking prozac at 40mg it is working already, I have more energy and can get up and do things more often. I&#039;ve not had a period on my full dose of prozac yet so I&#039;m not sure how it will work then, but from what I feel now, I think it will be great. 
Side effect: I have incredibly vivid and unpleasant dreams (but had that on citalopram at first) and they are so vivid I often confuse them with real life momentarily. I also have bruised and itchy legs."
