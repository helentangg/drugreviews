"So I started Effexor XR tonight for my anxiety that I deal with and let me just say NEVER EVER AGAIN!!

For two hours I felt fine, went to bed and suddenly was awaken by intense nausea so I sat up to wake my child&#039;s father(who stayed the night since we didn&#039;t know how this new med would affect me) and as soon as I sat up my stomach came up. There was no wait time. It&#039;s been five hours since I took it. And I&#039;ve been up throwing up for the last 45 mins. Not taking this crap again. I would honestly rather have be dealing with a panic attack at this point rather than this I can&#039;t even blink my eyes without vomiting crap!"
