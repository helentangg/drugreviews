"I&#039;m 22 years old and have had depression for 9 years. I&#039;ve tried Celexa, Paxil, Zoloft, and Xanax, but nothing has helped me better than Cymbalta. The first time I took it I threw up, and had no appetite for about 4 days. But the second day of taking it, I could tell it was working. I could focus more, I could smile more, I could go out in public and not panic. And T.V shows that I&#039;d seen before and didn&#039;t think was funny, I now watched and laughed at! Cymbalta has completely changed my life. I&#039;ve been taking 60mg a day for 2 weeks now and I can&#039;t remember ever being this happy and hopeful. It&#039;s very expensive if you don&#039;t have insurance, but there are organizations out there that will help you out with your prescriptions."
