"Been on Paxil for about 3 month starting my fouth it&#039;s been helping me a lot with my panic disorders &amp; social experiences. My mg for Paxil is low 20mg. 
However, whoever is starting this medication don&#039;t get discourage it will take ( 1 month) time for Paxil to kick in but it will be worth it. A big con is; that ejaculation time got delayed."
