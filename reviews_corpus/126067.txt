"I&#039;ve been on Viibryd 20mg for 18 months. My doctor suggested staying at 20mg at my follow up appointments because that dose currently works for my depression and mood changes. I still have to take it with a snack due to mild nausea. I don&#039;t like the abdominal distention (especially with PMS). I recently noticed memory problems and mixing up my words. Despite all that, I&#039;m not going to stop Viibryd because I was an emotional mess 18 months ago. Celexa and &quot;other&quot; meds left me dull and in a haze. Now, I can cope better and feel more like me!"
