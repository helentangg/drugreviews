"This medication has been a blessing.  I have fibromyalgia which has caused major depression.  I have taken every kind of medication out there that treats both.  Side effects from other medications was too much.  My doctor prescribed this although it does not treat fibromyalgia pain like most, it has made my mood much better. I feel much more happier and alive. I have only taken this medication for a month. Unlike most depression medication, I felt a huge difference the first day.  Many people talk about the side effects of nausea with this medication... I did not have any. If I did it was not a big enough deal to make me notice. Overall, I think this was the best antidepressant I have ever taken and I have so far had no side effects."
