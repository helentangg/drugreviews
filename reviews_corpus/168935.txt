"I was put on Viibryd because of severe short term memory loss and anxiety. After taking it for about a month I haven&#039;t been able to sleep through the night. Nausea, diarrhea, severe headaches, and since I moved up to the 20mg dose I have been having violent thoughts and starting getting suicidal thoughts. My legs twitch all night. Really frustrated will be seeing my doctor today. It has helped with my memory loss and episodes of confusions but side effects are bad. This medicine is not for me."
