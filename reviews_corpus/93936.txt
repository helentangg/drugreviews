"Two months on Trintellix. Amazing results. I had some stomach pain and headache at the first week. But with time, it all went away. Now, I am at enjoying relief from major depression. It is great. I had depression to the point I could not walk anymore and I gained over 40 pounds in one year. It is time to get in shape again. I am 100% happy  and got my life back. Thanks Trintellix!!!"
