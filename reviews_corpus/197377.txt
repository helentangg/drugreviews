"About 20 years ago, I was diagnosed with Panic Disorder.  After a year or so on Desipramine, my shrink switched me to Paxil.  I&#039;ve been taking 20mg/day for years now.  It saved my life.  About 10 years ago, after moving to a different State, I slowly weaned myself off Paxil at the suggestion of my former primary care physician.  In less than one year, I started having panic attacks again.  Long story short:  I&#039;m on Paxil 20 mg/day for life.  It doesn&#039;t not make sense to suffer with Panic Disorder."
