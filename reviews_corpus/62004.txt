"I have been on Citalopram for 5 years now. It works so well I am not planning to come off it ever. The Dr even suggested if I feel good on it, why come off ever, as he said no long term harm. So what if I&#039;m addicted to it. Without it I was way worse. Yes, it doesn&#039;t fix your anxiety, but it certainly reduces 90% of it thus making life much better. Alprazolam or Valium is also taken too as needed every so often. NHS Drs don&#039;t like giving those though, but insist... I have managed to get married, buy a house, run a business, and deal with life. Before, I could hardly get out of bed. Yes, some days are not perfect, but overall, it&#039;s the best med out there for long term use without crazy side effects."
