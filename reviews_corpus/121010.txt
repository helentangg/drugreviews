"this drug causes fluid retention in breasts in men, also it gave me serious constipation it was terrible, bloated belly, maybe it gave me slight hangover like feeling next day after I took it this drug gave me manic episodes and withdrawal was terrible, I would never recommend this drug to anyone

Went to my doctor he prescribed some medicine for constipation, I used it for a week and it was the terrible week, after that, I stopped taking it .Docs cannot do much but self-learning can"
