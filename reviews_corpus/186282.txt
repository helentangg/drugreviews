"My doctor prescribed Pristiq for anxiety.  The first 2 weeks I felt like a Zombie.  I had bouts of nausea(although I never threw up) and I really just felt strange most of the time.  I knew that this medicine had side effects so I stuck it out.  On the 14th day I awoke feeling awesome!  I am not exaggerating.  I have been taking Pristiq 50 mg for one month now and continue to feel great.  Several times a day I actually think to myself how happy and content I am.  That never happened before taking this medication.  The only side effect that I am experiencing is that it takes me longer to climax. I can live with that, considering how Pristiq has changed my life.  Give it a chance to work and you may find happiness once again."
