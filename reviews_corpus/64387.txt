"I&#039;ve been on the generic sertraline 50mg for about two weeks , and I feel
So much better . I was very depressed , irritable , had insomnia and felt like a total failure at life . I had a little diarrhea at first, but then I also have IBSD so I wasn&#039;t surprised . After a few days that stopped . I feel like my Old self again , like a weight has been lifted from my shoulders . I&#039;m even singing again , I haven&#039;t done that in about a year . I was in denial for a long time , I told myself I could handle the depression -I was wrong . This is the first anti-depressant I&#039;ve been on and I am very pleased with how much it has helped me."
