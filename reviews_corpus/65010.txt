"40 year old female on 50mg Sertraline for 4 months. I can finally walk into a store without having to turn right back around and go back home and can actually go places by myself now. The first two weeks were very VERY hard on me... but my sister promised me that if I got through the first 2 weeks it would get better and it did. I can actually open my mouth now and talk to people without panicking and I can actually start conversations which I have never done in my life. Works very well for social anxiety. I feel like I am finally myself and I don&#039;t feel like I&#039;m a weirdo anymore. Thinking about starting 100mg. Lost weight on this. I was 135lbs and now down to 120lbs. Wish I would have known about this med 20 years ago. I love it."
