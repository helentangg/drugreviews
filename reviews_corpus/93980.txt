"One month on 5mg of Trintellix.  I was on Zoloft for 3 years and was a zombie.  It is like a veil has been lifted.  I have energy like I did when I was in my 20s.  I also can see I am clearly surrounded by critical condescending people.  I never was able to give much thought to their behavior while on zoloft.  I am experiencing a euphoric feeling that was absent prior to trintellix."
