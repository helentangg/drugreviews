"I&#039;ve been taking fluoxetine for 6 months now. I started taking at night after my first day due to drowsiness. I wake up periodically through out the night. My dr says it&#039;s not the medicine. But it has to be. I haven&#039;t had a good nights sleep in months! &amp; I&#039;ve always loved to sleep. The medicine works awesome though"
