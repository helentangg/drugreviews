"I&#039;ve had migraines since I was 9. My parents weren&#039;t big on doctors so I &quot;bucked up&quot; through the raging pain. I didn&#039;t know until my 20&#039;s that having headaches every day wasn&#039;t normal. When I got married and my husband found me curled in a ball of pain, he didn&#039;t take &quot;I&#039;m okay&quot; for an answer and took me to his family GP. The first day I took Nortripylene my migraines vanished. I didn&#039;t even know life could be so pain free! It&#039;s been 8 years now and I&#039;ll happily take it forever to be free from the wracking pain. If I stop, they come back and remind me to get my refill. It has worked wonders for me."
