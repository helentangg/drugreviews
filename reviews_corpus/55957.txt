"I am 24 years old, female, 5&#039;1, 130 lbs. Treated for major depression and anxiety. I have aversions to junk food (I am normally health conscious unless I am really depressed), weight loss (12 lbs), dry mouth, lighter mood, easier to focus, more motivated, mountains turn into anthills, lower sex drive, sometimes get headaches. For me, the pros overwrite the cons - I went off of this for 6 months with no problems. No addiction or sickness. I am back on it and boy am I glad to feel happy again."
