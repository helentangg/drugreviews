"My neurologist prescribed Nardil approximately 4-5 years ago as a last effort to control my migraine headaches. This drug has worked better than all others tried at preventing migraines, but not without some annoying side effects such as weight gain, edema in lower legs and arms, some mild memory problems and probably most annoying is the caution exercised regarding medications and foods that are to be avoided while taking Nardil. I&#039;ve gone off of it once and it was a nightmare, made me very sick and weak. I eventually got off of it totally for several weeks, but the migraines came back with a vengeance, so had to go back on the Nardil. I&#039;m considering going off of it again soon simply because of the weight gain and edema."
