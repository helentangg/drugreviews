"I think maybe the 19 year old should have had something like Clonazepam prescribed as well.  I&#039;ve been taking 150 mg of &quot;V&quot; in the PM for awhile now and at first in the morning I feel really shaky all over and wonder if I made a mistake, then I take 0.5 mg, the lowest dose of Clonazepam and I level off and stay that way the rest of the day."
