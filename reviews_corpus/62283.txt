"In Sept 2012 I was in car wreck that resulted in Several herniated Discs and Bulging discs, as the pain kept on and seemed to increase, I began getting depressed, mix that with trying to plan a wedding, starting a new job, and issues with my oldest child, last week (we are now in Feb 2013) I had 3 bad panic attacks, found myself crying all the time, generally unhappy, snapping at people, and just completely exhausted, stressed out, full of anxiety and depression. Was nervous about taking Celexa because of side effects from Paxil in the past, But I did this morning before going to work and halfway there I realized I immediately felt better than I have in a very long time. I am on 10mg and no bad side effects. I actually was happy today."
