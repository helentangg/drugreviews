"After suffering from Generalized Anxiety Disorder, PANIC and Social anxiety, inability to exercise or walk beyond 5min, I started 5mg escitalopram 10 days ago. I expereinced increased anxiety and panic attacks after escitalopram. My doc put me on Rivotril 0.25 four times daily. It sort of controlled panic but I still get bouts of anxiety and panic. Rivotril makes me too sleepy while Xanax suits me more, but my doctor does not allow Xanax. I am on 10 mg of escitalopram now and hoping to see improvement. "
