"Hi, 
    Like others, I have been on medication for 10 years, effexor that is @ 300 mg a day!! Now I see that is wayyy to much! I should of researched it when I started effexor. Coming off of Effexor took a month of SLOWLY weaning down, still was really, really bad... The worst it felt like! 

I went for 4 weeks without any depression meds, I wanted to see how I would feel. The first 3 weeks after my last dose of effexor @ 75 mg every other day for a week, (so u know where I was chemically), the first 2 weeks after my last dose of effexor was wonderful, I thought I am OK!
