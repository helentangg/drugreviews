"I&#039;m prescribed 200mg nightly for depression/ borderline personality disorder along with qutepine 600mg .

Amitripyline are so sedating for me which I like , it&#039;s better than any benzodiazepines like temazepam .
The trick is take your dose for bedtime about 2 hours before you want to sleep .
For me I take mine around 8pm -9pm and I&#039;m gone by 11pm some nights it takes only an hour other nights 3 hours but they&#039;re great for sleep .
I was once taken off them in hospital and nothing compared.
Word of advise - do not drink alcohol unless it&#039;s hours and hours before you take your dose.
I&#039;ve blacked out drinking and taking them after drinking loads ."
