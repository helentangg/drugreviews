"I love this medication. Been on it for a year for OCD and anxiety disorder. It makes me a normal person. Don&#039;t have nearly as many panic attacks and OCD is under control. I have lost weight on it cause I feel so good about myself. I enjoy doing activities again. Recommend for anyone who has  anxiety disorders. Also,blood pressure has gone down."
