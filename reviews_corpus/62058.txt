"This medicine changed my life! I suffered from anorexia,  anxiety and mild depression.  For two plus years now I am free of these afflictions and live a happy well adjusted life! For me the results started immediately,  maybe a little too much results at first.  The biggest shock is that the day after I started taking the medication, I  physically saw myself differently in the mirror. This was a huge step to overcoming my anorexia. I no longer dwelled  on the motor mirror or cried all the time and my general anxiety was quelled. My mind was no longer racing and focusing on negatives. 

After 8  weeks I felt like a normal person."
