"I&#039;ve been on it for a week at 5 mg. I take it right after dinner so my stomach is nice and full, and have had no experience of nausea. I haven&#039;t noticed much in the reduction of anxiety but it&#039;s too early. Had stomach aches the first few days but those went away, and feel hot constantly but otherwise the side effects have been pretty manageable. Hopefully it starts to do more in the way of anxiety as I am starting 10 mg in one week!"
