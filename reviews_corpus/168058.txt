"I was prescribed imipramine for depression. It worked very well for years! BUT... it made me a diabetic with peripheral neuropathy. When I was originally given the medication I was told it would increase my appetite. It did - a LOT! It also raised my glucose levels to astronomical levels (400-500). My A1c was between 10 and 11. Over time, it damaged my nerves. I didn&#039;t realize this until my feet began to burn. After slowly decreasing imipramine by 5 mg per week until completely coming off it, my feet were unbearable. The pain was constant. I couldn&#039;t walk, or have anything on my feet. I would sleep with my blankets folded up and my feet hanging off the bed. I would soak my feet in ice water to alleviate the burning and pain."
