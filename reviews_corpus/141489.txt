"I started on cipralex 10mg about a month ago then increased to 15mg 2 weeks ago. I have Major Depression and Social anxiety disorder and have for many years untreated. Although the first day on cipralex I did notice the side effects a great deal such as, dizziness, unable to focus, thoughts were running a mile a minute, couldnt sleep, nausea(no vomitting), felt extremely anxious and just had a all around body high (trembling and sensitive skin) I would not recommend taking cipralex FOR THE FIRST TIME on a day you need to do anything.I literally laid in bed for hours feeling very weird and thinking very weird thoughts. But after first day side effects left and have noticed I am actually happy again no low moods all around feel hopeful!!"
