"I have been taken citalopram  since I&#039;m 19 years old, after an acute life event.
I started with 20mg a day po which helped me for over 1 year.
After 1 year I felt that my depression is coming back so I talked to my physician and we increased the daily dose to 40mg po.
I am now taking this medication for over 6 years and for me its the one and only medication that helps.
Yes I have had some side effects like loosing weight (15 pounds) trouble sleeping (5-6 h) a day max. and insomnia.
But still I can finally start living my normal life which I could not do without this medication.
I work as a Rn in a ED and see a lot of patients with depression, ptsd (like me) or other problems who don&#039;t take any medications, which I would not recommend..."
