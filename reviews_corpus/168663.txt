"Been taking viibryd for 2 years now.  Was only on 10mg first few weeks nausea and loose frequent stools each week thethe symptoms lessen and I could feel the benefits.  I was happy and relaxed, no decrease in sex drive and didn&#039;t have any of the side effects that I could notice (chronic back pain,  gi issues, and difficulty sleeping my whole life). My doctor gives me samples and coupons when he can but it is extremely expensive."
