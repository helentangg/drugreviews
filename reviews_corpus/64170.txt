"My 14 year old son has been on sertraline 25 mg  for about 7 months for anxiety,  it has really helped him a lot. But now he has become  depressed,  I believe  school  has a lot to do with it, because  he just got into his second  semester  and now has a class called pace, and he has to go in front of the class and talk, he hates that, so today  he had a little  breakdown  and refused to  go to school  and said he felt overwhelmed,  so I took him to his doctor  and the  doctor  upped his dosage  to 50mg, but my daughter  says it&#039;s not a good idea because  it could trigger suicide,  so I don&#039;t  know what to do,  my son is also in therapy."
