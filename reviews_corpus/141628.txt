"I&#039;ve been battling Depression for 5 years. It got really bad right after I gave birth to my son who is now turning 5. I would cry for no reason and get really upset over the little things. My depression got really bad last year and it affected my relationship. My confidence got really low and I would constantly put myself down. I had several bad Panic Attacks while at a restaurant which caused us to immediately leave.  I have a great support system with my boyfriend and started Lexapro two months ago.  I feel so Great about Everything! I&#039;m currently taking 10 mg and I finally feel a better me and truly seeing life.  Thanks Lexapro!"
