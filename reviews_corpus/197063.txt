"I have grown up my entire life not knowing how to talk to people, being told I was shy, sweating, and getting red faced whenever I would talk in front of people. &quot;I would never try anything new and would get nervous and upset when I would have to change plans or be around people. I have been on Paxil for over a year and I tell everyone how it has saved my life. Now, I do not think that Paxil completely changed me, I have also been going to school and building up my confidence. Paxil was the push I needed to get out, be social, and network. As I become more educated I am more and more confident and I thank paxil, and God, everyday. I wish I could be a Paxil Spokesperson!!! It has literally changed my entire life and helped me branch out!"
