"I have had anxiety attacks since i was 24. I was on Prozac for almost 15 years and it really helped. I went off it on my doctor&#039;s advice, saying I could cure it with diet and exercise, about 6 months later I was in a terrible position and dreaded life. I saw a psychiatrist that I paid out of pocket because Covered CA tries to get you to see people with MA Degrees in counseling. Of course, they are much cheaper.  The very kind Psychiatrist empathized with me and said I should not have to feel this way. He put me on Sertraline, starting on 50mg working my way up to 300mg over two months, the first 2-3 weeks were hard. I had some sexual side effects that are gone now and I feel like a normal person again. I am extremely happy with this."
