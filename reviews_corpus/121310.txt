"I&#039;ve been taking venlafaxine 150mg xr for nearly 3 years along with an antipsychotic to treat bipolar 2. Having tried all kinds of anti depressants this is the one that&#039;s worked for me. The down side is the withdrawal symptoms should you miss a dose but these go away as soon as you take it again. Dizzy spells/feeling drunk is the only way I can describe them. It has a short half life of 7 hrs which indicates that they have these symptoms.  I&#039;ve had no side effects &amp; would recommend venlafaxine over other antidepressants inc citelopram &amp;  mirtazipine."
