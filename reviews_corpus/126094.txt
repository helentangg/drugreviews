"After reading many reviews I have to say I was very nervous to start Viibryd. I started on a day off from work. The first 3 days I had a slight headache and very slight GI issues. After taking Tylenol my headache was relieved. Definitely recommend taking with food. I just started week 2 at 20 mg. So far so good. No headache or GI upset. No interruption in sleep patterns so far. I feel very calm taking the medication. I will be excited to see what week 3 brings. My kids and husband thanks Viibryd already!"
