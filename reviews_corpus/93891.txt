"I&#039;m on the fence with Trintellix.  I had been taking Zoloft for about a year and a half with no problems, except I started to lose all emotions...not happy, not sad.  No motivation.  My doctor suggested Trintellix, so I switched and have been on 10 mg for about 3 months.  I feel nauseous every time I take it, but it&#039;s tolerable and just passes.  However, yesterday, about 30 min after taking it, eating and having some coffee, I had to run to the bathroom to vomit, like a lot.  Today, I also feel even more nauseous.  I&#039;m surprised after 3 months that it is still just as bad, if not worse.  However, from a mood perspective, I feel SO much better.  Not sure if lowering the dose would help or what, but any suggestions would be helpful :)"
