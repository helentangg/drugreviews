"Escitalopram (Lexipro) has significantly decreased my constant anxiety.   I suffered from non-stop worry and fear related to my job, future, social gatherings, business meetings, etc.  Now I rarely suffer from negative, ruminating thoughts and I  enjoy life and work much more.  I feel so much more connected to the world around me, having previously felt so different and alienated.  There have been some negative side effects including a significant drop in my libido.  But even my wife would tell you that she prefers the stable, calm person that I am today instead of the irritable, anxious and, yes, sex-obsessed, person that I was prior to seeking treatment."
