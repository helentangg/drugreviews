"I have only been on Prozac for 2 days, I haven&#039;t had any irritable moments like I normally do but that could just be normal for me.  I am anxious about the side effects, and anxious to know if this is going to help me.  I am 30 years old and have suffered from OCD, and anxiety for years.  I have never taken anything for it, I just thought it was something I could control on my own, but came to the realization that I can&#039;t control everything.  Now I am just waiting to see what happens and if this wonder drug will work for me."
