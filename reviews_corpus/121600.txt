"I had a hysterectomy over a year ago, and immediately started with hot flashes. The flashes were so bad I was experiencing 5-6 severe hot flashes an hour, immediately after starting venlafaxine 37.5 for 1 week/then 75mg after, they decreased in severity and I may have 4-5 a day, and for the first time in over a year I am able to sleep most nights all the way through.  By taking venlafaxine, I was able to discontinue 2 medications (6 pills)."
