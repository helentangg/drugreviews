"I have been taking Zoloft for 1 year 4 months and at the back of my mind I have this niggling voice that tells me I cannot be on this medicine forever. Zoloft changed my life, saved me my marriage and kids and gave me back my life and laughter. If it was not for Zoloft I would have jumped off a bridge by now! Why I rated it 9/10 is because I have gained 9 pounds since I have been on it and the pounds are just refusing to fall off. Very increased appetite due to being sane and happy, hanging out, having good and bad food and having my glass of wine! Rather be fat and happy then thin and miserable."
