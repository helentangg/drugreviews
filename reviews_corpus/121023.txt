"If  I had to choose which medication to stop taking, either my heart medicine or my Venlafaxine/Effexor, I would rather go without my heart med!  For years I went from doctor to doctor trying to get someone to do something about the depression that I had experienced since puberty.  Everyone just blew me off.  The doctor that finally put me on Effexor XR saved my life.  This is not one of those meds that you have to wait forever to see results.  I felt better right away!  The crying spells stopped.  I was talking to people again.  I was getting my life back!  It has caused weight gain, about 10 pounds per year.  Just be aware of that.  They have tried to take me off of it for that reason but nothing else helps nearly as much."
