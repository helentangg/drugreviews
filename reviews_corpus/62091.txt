"So I was severely depressed for over a year for a very stupid reason. I wouldn&#039;t leave my house, my condition was very bad. I was having panic, anxiety, suffering etc. So, I decided to start this medicine.  Would say comparing to Zoloft this is much better, my initial days were horrible I could not sleep and it took about 3 weeks for me to start feeling better. But after a month of use, even though I was sleeping well, I noticed during the days I had very little energy and felt very lazy. So I decided to quit rather than increase dose. After a month and half use I quit cold turkey and am feeling much better and don&#039;t feel any withdrawal symptoms, hope this helps."
