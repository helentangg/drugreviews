"I&#039;m taking 10mg as prescribed.  I didn&#039;t feel the need for it but the Dr. recommended it.  I&#039;m hoping my sex drive will increase and to be more patient when driving (not as irritable).  I&#039;m still in week one but I do have multiple side effects:  nausea, head aches.  I really hope they stop soon.  I&#039;m still optimistic about this med.  Reading some reviews on here helped.  If it doesn&#039;t get better, I&#039;ll just stop."
