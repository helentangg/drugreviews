"I&#039;ve been on zoloft for probably about 4 months now and it has absolutely SAVED my life. I was so hesitant to get on it again (I was on it previously about 5 years ago from ages 14-18 for OCD - which it worked well for that, too), but I wish I had done it sooner! my social anxiety is practically gone and I&#039;m actually for once excited about my future instead of terrified. I can talk to people and be myself and I actually LIKE myself now!! Where before I was convinced I was a worthless nobody. I&#039;m much more confident in myself and my abilities and if somebody doesn&#039;t like me it no longer bothers me because i like me. I haven&#039;t felt this normal in 5 years. Thank you Zoloft"
