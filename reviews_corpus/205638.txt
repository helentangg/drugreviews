"I guess I have had major depression my whole life and I have taken a pill here and there, but I never stuck with it.  Recently with the passing of my Mother, I guess emotionally I hit rock bottom and decided I needed to look at doing something and sticking with it. Pristiq was the second medication my Doctor put me on, and I am at week three and I am amazed.  It came to late to salvage my current relationship, but my partner says, that I am a different person and asks if it is real.  It is real, I feel like I did when I used to be happy, when was that?  Years ago, I am thinking more clearly.  I am still grieving for the newly loss of my mother and my relationship at the same time, but my mind is &quot;Clear&quot; and I am singing in the shower."
