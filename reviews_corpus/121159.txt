"Effexor XR saved my life!  I had severe clinical depression for one year, and my doctor tried 8 different antidepressants on me, all to no avail.  I sought the help of a psychopharmacologist in Palo Alto, Ca.  He met with me for 90 minutes, did an evaluation, and prescribed Effexor XR for me.  He stairstepped me up to 300mg/day within 12 days, and within 2 weeks I felt like my old self again.  It felt miraculous. I may be on it for the rest of my life, but I don&#039;t mind one bit.  I am enjoying life again!"
