"My son, then 12, started Paxil for social anxiety after going to a new school. The pediatrician gave us none of the warnings about the drug. He started him on 10 mg/day for 4 weeks and said, &quot;We know this dose does nothing, but we need to load him. After 4 weeks, fill this prescription for 20 mg/day.&quot; At 2-3 weeks, my son was raising his hand and greeting teachers in the hall. At 4 weeks, he initiated a belligerent locker room incident with a boy who mocked him. After doubling the dose, he was verbally aggressive to us and ran away. When we found him, he was soaked in sweat. He later told a friend he&#039;d &quot;felt like jumping off something but didn&#039;t know what&quot;. His doctor had no idea how to wean him. We found a psychiatrist who did."
