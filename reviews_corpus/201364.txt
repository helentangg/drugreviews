"This med worked for me years ago but this time after taking it for 2 days I&#039;m worse (50 mg). Bad headache, stomach upset, and anxiety. My pharmacy switched generics &amp; that also could be part of the problem. I am a mental wreck &amp; a shell of my former self. I really just want to stay in bed all day. I don&#039;t have a psych just a GP. I also have horrible OCD &amp; every decision I make I feel is wrong. I have refills left on my Celexa &amp; that worked a little better but didn&#039;t do the trick. I asked my GP for Wellbutrin at my last visit &amp; for some reason she didn&#039;t want to give it to me."
