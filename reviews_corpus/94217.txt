"I just started this medication after using Lexapro for 18 months and it quit working. My doctors office had some samples of Brintellix and switched me over. Since I started this medication I have been so sleepy I can&#039;t get off the couch. My mood/depression is much better but I can&#039;t stand being tired all the time. I will give it another week, and if it does not get better I will call my doctor."
