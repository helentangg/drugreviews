"Have previously been on this medication 6 years ago. In between have been on SSRI&#039;s and venlafaxine (the latter being a nightmare to withdraw from). Now after a year of medication free I&#039;m back on amitriptyline at my request due to mega anxiety and stress issues (not my doctor&#039;s first choice), also currently taking Ramipril and diltiazem for high blood pressure - so far early days and am suffering the main side effect of tiredness but managed a 2.5 mile jog last night. It&#039;s early days and I am hoping this will work as well as it did in the past."
