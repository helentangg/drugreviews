"It will do nothing negative. Give it a try to enjoy life.  Life is short. Don&#039;t take the burden of social anxiety and panic attacks for your whole life. If you still feel terrible when taking Paxil use inderal as well and you will see an improvement in life. My score for Paxil CR is 9/10 in just  days.  PS if you ignore this illness it will give you IBS, high BP, anxiety, messes with career goals, gives heart problems, sleep problems, low energy, you need short naps, always low confidence and so on.  I avoided medicines from age18 to 28 years and now finally I took the step for paxil. Stay blessed ...."
