"I have been on Viibryd for 2 days now and the only side effect that I have had is a lot of gas and had to use the bathroom about 10 times but it was not diarrhea. I am on 10mg for 6 days and then will go to 20mg. I felt a little tingling sensation in my head after I initially took it. But so far so good. I am also on other medicines Latuda, Cogentin, Propranolol and Ativan. No trouble sleeping last night. Actually I just fell right asleep but woke up at 6am and felt very rested. "
