"I have tried many different antidepressants over a 20 year span, I would be on one that worked wonders and after being on it for about 6 yrs, it would stop working. I was on Paxil and Cymbalta for 6 yrs each, my doctor switched me to Viibryd in August so I have been on it for almost 3 months now.  I do not feel any better, in fact my muscle aches have increased tremendously and I cannot sleep.  I have horrible night terrors. I have night terrors almost every night to the point I dread going to bed. This medicine is not working for me at all!"
