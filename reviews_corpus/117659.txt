"I have been on Nortriptyline for 4 weeks now. At first I was so lethargic. That has improved greatly. My mouth dryness is also improving. Up until yesterday I felt this med was &quot;the one&quot;. I am new to migraines, had 2 that lasted greater than 7 days a piece. The second was so bad I was directly admitted from my first neurology appointment to the hospital for 14 DHE treatments (yuck). I have had at least 4 mild-moderate headaches a week, that too is improving. Yesterday I started to have tingling from mid calf to my 4 small toes. Has anyone else have that issue?"
