"I&#039;ve only been on this medication for about 2 weeks. That said, I&#039;ve slept almost every day since starting it. I know sleepiness is a common side effect but this is excessive. Almost no energy throughout the day. Nonstop yawning. My depression is still there, anxiety has been better. I just feel very drained and apathetic. I&#039;ll stick with it for a while longer because I know it will take a while for the full affect to kick in. hoping for good results!"
