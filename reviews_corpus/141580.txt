"First, the positive. I&#039;ve suffered from anxiety my entire life. This medication helped tremendously in that it was under control while I was on it. If you suffer from anxiety, you know how wonderful this can be.

The negative. I gained 20 pounds quickly that I couldn&#039;t get rid of. I decided to get off of the medication because I was trying to get pregnant. The withdrawals were really bad. I had brain zaps non-stop, couldn&#039;t stand up straight because of dizziness and extreme confusion. Now, keep in mind I tapered myself slowly off this medication, per doctor&#039;s orders. It took 5 months before I wasn&#039;t experiencing these withdrawal symptoms. Horrific."
