"I WISH Lexapro worked for me like it seems to for everyone else. The first few weeks were a nightmare (tired, nauseous, dizzy, panic attacks), but it did get me out of the deep slump I was in. Then I seemed to get better out of the blue but for the past couple of weeks I&#039;ve slowly been slipping back into that slump. I&#039;ve been on it about 2 months. It&#039;s causing me to have the most bizarre nightmares. I can&#039;t stop thinking about them during the day. I feel like a total zombie too, no emotion whatsoever. I guess that&#039;s why I feel like my anxiety has been eased. I&#039;ve NEVER felt like this before, it&#039;s just bizarre."
