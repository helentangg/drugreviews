"I&#039;m wondering about generic Pristiq.  My pharmacy dispensed 50 mg tablets of generic Pristiq about a month ago.  My pdoc was surprised since she didn&#039;t even know there was such a thing.  I took them one time, and experienced profound anxiety and depression.  I have been in to see her three times since.  I still feel like I&#039;m being affected by whatever was in those pills.  My doc upped my Klonopin (which I did NOT want to do), but we had no choice.  I am now still on the brand name Pristiq, but had to go up 50 mg.  I don&#039;t know what the deal was, but I would advise anyone taking Pristiq to stick with the brand name.  I am just now starting to feel &quot;normal&quot; again!  I have read that the patent on Pristiq won&#039;t be up for several more years!!"
