"My Dr. Prescribed me Doxepin 10mg. For depression, anxiety, and insomnia. So far so good, calms me down wonderfully when my three kids or my husband cause me to have an anxiety attack, and is working well with my depression. Only things it isn&#039;t doing to much for my insomnia I still go to bed at about 9pm and fall asleep around  2:30-3:00am. I have also taken Lexapro which worsened my depression, Zoloft just made me feel like a  zombie or like I was wired out of my mind, and Prozac which worked great on me but since I have insomnia my Dr. gave me Doxepin."
