"I was diagnosed with depression/anxiety i&#039;m 19, i was put on 50mg sertraline which made me constantly have a headache for the week i was on it, made me very tired and i was quite achy too. went back to doctors and she put me on fluoxetine 20mg, i have been taking this for just over 2 weeks now &amp; even though i&#039;m still quite tired (might just be me), i already feel a lot better. Before on fluoxetine I was always over thinking things, i didn&#039;t want to leave the house or go out, i was off work for 3 weeks as could not stop myself from crying, i was worried my relationship would end! now i&#039;m a lot more positive, I&#039;m going out and not crying anywhere near as much, never felt happier and my relationship has never been better! :)"
