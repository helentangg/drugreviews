"I began taking Prozac ~8 weeks ago for mild depression. At the last minute I learned it may also help with Binge Eating Disorder, which I&#039;ve struggled with for 25 years.  Within 3 days of taking 10mg/day, I had zero obsession with food.  I ate, but easily stopped after 2 oreos, no joke, it felt like a total miracle!  However at ~7 weeks, I realized I&#039;d started a binge cycle again, and ate everything in sight for about a week.  

I suspect my dose is too low and my brain adjusted and no longer benefits from my 10 mg.  I&#039;m started taking a 2nd pill every other day for an avg dose of 15mg in hopes of getting back to that sweet spot with my BED.  I read most folks don&#039;t see Prozac work for BED until 60mg, has anyone had luck taking less?"
