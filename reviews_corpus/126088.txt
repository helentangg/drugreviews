"The first weeks were a bit difficult. I had diarrhea but I assure you this won&#039;t last. Take it with food, not just milk. I did have some nightmares from which I could not easily awaken, when I stepped up to Viibryd 20 and was not careful about taking the medicine at exactly the same time, resolved by taking it in the the morning instead of the evening. Viibryd has only a 24 half-life. I did have some temporary morning headaches when it was past time for me to take the medicine. Dr advised take Viibryd 20 at dinner time, which left enough in my system to avoid morning headaches. I&#039;m back to just 40, feeling great!
