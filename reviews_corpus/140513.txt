"I&#039;ve been taking lexapro for depression and anxiety for the past 3 or so months. at first I saw a change in my mood and anxiety levels, and my anxiety overall is a bit better. I don&#039;t know whether i need to talk to the doctor about upping my dosage or about taking another medication on the whole. Anyone else have or had this problem with lexapro?"
