"My gosh...I can&#039;t say enough about this medication. I suffered through a series of traumatic events one three years ago, and felt that my dulled emotions were simply situational. Eventually, it got to the point where I couldn&#039;t maintain a clean house, missed deadlines, isolated myself from friends and others, and would pray that I wouldn&#039;t wake up some mornings. This is the first antidepressant I&#039;ve tried, 30mg dose. Aside from slight appetite suppression, I&#039;ve experienced no side effects. I&#039;ve been on it almost a week, and I notice I awaken without that heavy depressive weight on my chest. The feelings of failure, the crying jags, and the crippling anxiety are diminishing already."
