"I&#039;ve been on Cymbalta for 2 days and it is great.  My daily high anxiety is completely diminished.  I can make decisions without anxiety.  I am having trouble with sleepiness however, I know this will subside.  I got back on antidepressants because I&#039;ve had a tough time dealing with moms death in May and currently going through divorce."
