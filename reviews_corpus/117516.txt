"I&#039;ve never felt so angry in my life than on this drug! Terrible!!!!
Frustrating because doctors won&#039;t prescribe my OxyContin I&#039;ve been on for 9 years ( that completely helped my back after 3 failed surgeries) anymore because of all the irresponsible people abusing it! HOW IS THAT FAIR!?  So annoyed that people who really need it  have to pay the price! So I&#039;ve been trying all this junk that has terrible side effects."
