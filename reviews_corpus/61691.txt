"I started citalopram at 20mg and remained on this dose for approximately eight weeks, but increased to 30mg due to lack of efficacy. Due to a significant decline in my mood, I had withdrawn citalopram and had done so in increments of 10mg. It did not reduce my anxiety or depression. The side effects were minimal, though I occasionally experienced nausea whilst taking this drug. I cannot say for sure whether if it intensified my depression, but there was absolutely no improvement."
