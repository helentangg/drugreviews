"I started on Lexapro after going through a divorce and for anxiety, tension and daily pressures at my job.  The first week I could tell a difference, as I wasnt worrying and agonizing over &quot;what I still had to do&quot; every day. I also got back my concentration, which I had lost due to feeling overwhelmed day in, day out.  I felt sleepy the 1st couple of weeks, had mild diarrea  and felt somewhat unemotional . I didn&#039;t feel the highs of being happy nor the lows of being sad.  But after about a month, my emotions returned , and the sleepiness and diarrea subsided. The only side effect that really bothered me was I gained 35 lbs, a side effect of most anti-depressants. But the trade off to me was well worth it. I don&#039;t stress &amp; I can enjoy life !"
