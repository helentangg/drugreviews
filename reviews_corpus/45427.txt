"I&#039;ve battled depression for five years and anxiety since I was a kid. The first two weeks on Prozac, everything got ten times worse. I couldn&#039;t function or stop crying or hating myself. But after that, the depression subsided. I&#039;m more confident, calm, and I shy from negative thoughts and sadness rather than welcoming those things like I used to. It has helped my depression an incredible amount, but I have seen a little less improvement in the anxiety (even with cognitive behavioral therapy). Side effects for me are lots of yawning and loss of appetite."
