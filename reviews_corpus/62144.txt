"I was diagnosed with major depression 6 years ago when I was 18 years old. I was started on 100mg of Zoloft. You hear the commercials about side effects of SSRIs about how they can &quot;increase suicidal thoughts in children and young adults&quot;. Well Zoloft did that to me and made my depression even worse until I eventually was suicidal and was hospitalized.  Then they switched me to 60mg Celexa and I have never had any problems with it! I&#039;ve been on it for 5 1/2 years and the only side effect I have is low libido.  The FDA lowered the max recommended dose to 40mg so my doctor lowered my dose too. I have been okay on 40mg but I wish I was still allowed to have the 60mg. I wonder why the max dose got lowered?"
