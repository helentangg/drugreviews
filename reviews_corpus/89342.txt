"I can&#039;t say enough good things about this medication. I&#039;ve fought mild-to-moderate depression on-and-off for twenty years. I&#039;ve done counseling and read tons of books. I also tried Paxil years ago but found it numbing. 

Celexa has been WONDERFUL. I&#039;m on 20mg a day. The crying spells, feelings of doubt and despair, and constant negative thoughts have all gone away. I still have up and down moods and feelings but they feel normal and manageable...like what regular people must feel like. I feel much more confident, happy and engaged with life.

As for side effects...not to be crude, but the only side effect I&#039;ve experienced is delayed orgasm and, as a man, this is more of a benefit than a problem ;-)

I highly recommend this medication..."
