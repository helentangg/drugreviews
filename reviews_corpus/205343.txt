"This is the 4th medication I&#039;ve been on and the hardest one to work through. I suffer from mainly anxiety and PTSD not so much depression. I am also extremely sensitive to medication and have experienced all of the side effects. Pristiq made me more depressed than ever, and knew this was not me. I was always tired, then I halved the pill and its worked wonders!! Anyone suffering mainly anxiety I suggest you do this before jumping ship. I have my energy back, and going to the gym almost everyday. I also dropped weight using this medication. I&#039;m getting back my life after losing to this drug for almost 3 months. Please Try HALVING the tablet- best advice ever given :) Now I can go back on teaching rounds without suffering social anxiety."
