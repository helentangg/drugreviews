"I have been taking Sertraline 50 mg for 8 months now after my marriage broke up. I am taking it for depression and anxiety, Initially the side effects were really horrendous for the first two weeks, loss of appetite, night sweats, and generally feeling sick, my mood did not really pick up until about week four, but since then I have felt much happier I would even go to say that I have not felt as calm for years. For you men out there worrying about sexually dysfunction, don%u2019t worry I have no complaints there at all. All I can say really is at first nothing seem to be getting better, if this happens to you hang in there because when it does its well worth the wait."
