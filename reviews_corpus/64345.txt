"Never taken &quot;psychedelic&quot; meds before. Diagnosed with depression in 2001 and felt I could &quot;deal with it&quot; without meds.
Got to a stage where I was so down, total apathy, I had to do something. 
I&#039;ve been on sertraline for 7 days.
Dizzy spells, still down but not quite as bad. Tired ALL the time, but was before taking.
I do hope this stuff helps long term"
