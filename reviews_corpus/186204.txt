"I am a female, 44 yo, took Pristiq over 9 months up to 100mg. It gave a little relief to my depression but did nothing for anxiety and panic attacks. I left my job on disability while on it, unable to cope anymore!  I am still trying to find the right antidepressant.  Tried Zoloft, Manerix, Celexa,Cymbalta, Wellbutrin without noticeable success or just bad side effects!  Note I had no major side effects with Pristiq."
