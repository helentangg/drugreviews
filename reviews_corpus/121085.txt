"I started taking Effexor about 3 days ago. So far, it&#039;s been pretty crazy. I&#039;m sweaty all of the time, nauseous yet starving, and cannot stay asleep for the life of me. However, it is really helping with my anxiety. I suffer from dermatilioma, which causes me to pick my skin. I have noticed that I&#039;ve been picking A LOT LESS in just 3 days! My scabs are clearing up, and I&#039;m not &quot;catching&quot; myself picking nearly as often. I also feel calm and relaxed. The side effects seriously suck though. As I type this, my phone is about to slip out of my hands from sweat. I&#039;m a 95 lb 21 year old and I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever sweated so much in my life. It&#039;s also been making dizzy. It&#039;s worth it to me though. If it will help me stop picking, I&#039;ll do anything."
