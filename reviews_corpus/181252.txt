"Fluoxetine/prozac 20mg for depression/anxiety.
Within 4 hours of taking it at 4pm I truely felt better by 8 pm and happier not sure it was the meds at first or believing it to be working?,had done a lot research before taking it positives and negatives so have an open mind about prozac,certainly felt better quickly after initail dose!.
First 2 weeks slight headaches,bit spaced initially,groggy,dry mouth,difficult concentrate,but I did feel like this whilst depressed!
Now 3rd week its kicked in after 2 weeks and I feel calmer relaxed able to think clearly not foggy mind feel focused happier motivated.
This drug has dealt with anxiety&amp;depression,100%,I was worrying everything,sleep is OK now,no sexual dysfunction yet!.
Good luck."
