"Has been amazing so far for fibromyalgia pain, that had become unbearable over the years. Pain couldn&#039;t be lived with anymore. Also have depression. Has helped, could be better though. Had C-4 to C-7 replaced with implants, and spur removed, still have herniated back. This helped and side effects gone."
