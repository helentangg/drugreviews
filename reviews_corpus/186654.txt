"I absolutely loved Pristiq - great energy - great sex - felt good. I unfortunately suffered a side effect that I couldn&#039;t empty my bladder all the way. So that meant sleep deprivation. My MD thought it was a UTI, but getting off the medicine and seeing a urologist cleared up the symptoms. The urologist said it was a very common side effect of Pristiq. He put me on Flomax for a couple of weeks... Loved Pristiq, hate that I can&#039;t take it."
