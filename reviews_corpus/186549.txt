"I have been taking Pristiq for about 3 weeks now, and I am extremely tired 24/7. Now mind you I do have a busy schedule (full time job and classes 24 hours a wk). I do notice however that things don&#039;t bother me like they used to and my crying has eased up a bit. I have started having some nausea, hopefully the tiredness and nausea will diminish the longer I take Pristiq."
