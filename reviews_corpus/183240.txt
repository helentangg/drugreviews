"I took this for 5 years at 90mg. I eventually had to go off this medication because the side effects were intolerable.  I had night terrors every night, severe night sweats, teeth grinding and insomnia.  The thing that finally did it for me was the migraines that were caused by my shoulder and neck tension on this medication.  In short, it made me feel extremely anxious and stressed out.  

Also, withdrawal is very tough.  I have been off this medicine for 3 weeks and still have severe nausea, anxiety, night sweats and night terrors."
