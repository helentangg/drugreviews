"I am a Flight Attendant for a major airline.  I went into the Flight Deck where the Captain and the First Officer sit 6 years ago and my anxiety developed from one major panic attack after another.  I tried everything and I was a biggest advocate for NOT taking medicine.  After a 6 year battle I started seeing a doctor of Psychology and a doctor of Psychiatry.  Both advised I take Lexapro.  I started taking 5 mg for a month then upped to 10 mg a month and then my doctor upped me to 20 mg per day.  I have been battling going to work for six years because of Anticipatory Anxiety on an airplane.  I am happy to say that I am now back to work and doing things I never thought in my mind that I could ever do.  Give Lexapro a chance, its worked!"
