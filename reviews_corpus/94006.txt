"It&#039;s known within the pharmaceutical industry that 5% of patients will suffer 90% of side effects from any given drug.  That&#039;s me, and an MTBI bumped me up to the elite 2.5% who get side effects never heard of.  But Trintellix was supposed to be good for depression from brain injury, so I gave it a try.
No gastric symptoms, but on day 2, I woke up not knowing what day it was.  7 hours after second dose, heightened anxiety and a sense of &quot;speeding&quot;, without the edge, took hold.  Then, I found myself annoyed that Shaw&#039;s was out of everything I usually bought there - until the egg case in the wrong place alerted me I was in Stop &amp; Shop.  No memory of deciding to go there.  Bu-bye Trintellix.  Just glad I only paid $3.10 for it."
