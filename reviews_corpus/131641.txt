"I&#039;ve been taking Effexor XR 37.5 mgs for 8 days &amp; the worse SEs are horrible fatigue &amp; sweats. The 1st day I was light-headed but that went away. I skipped today to see if I got withdrawal symptoms &amp; I did. Tomorrow I will go back on it. If the chronic fatigue continues I will have to figure which med to try next. For my depression to subside I would probably need a higher dosage but I don&#039;t think I could handle the SEs. I know for some people it works well at 150 mgs but I could never tolerate that dose."
