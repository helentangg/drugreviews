"This med works so well for me.  However, I went through nearly a DOZEN other meds before hitting the jackpot.

My particular form of depression leaves me tearful all the time, and over the most trivial of things: a song or poem, a touching TV commercial, even a good restaurant meal!  It&#039;s hard to exist in the world when things--good and bad--leave me so emotionally moved.

And without Zoloft I will get obsessed with things like a tragic news story (would spend days reading every detail I could find), or even manically getting interested in finding all I could about some random subject (history of alchemy, the witness protection program, the practice of crop rotation, etc.). This goes beyond curiosity.

Long story short: Zoloft works for me!"
