"I have multiple health issues and am very anxious about them. Have been on and off Effexor 75mg twice now (going off when felt better) over 3 years and just started again with anxiety of upcoming surgeries. Going on I experience nausea and can only eat dry biscuits for about 2 weeks. Going off them 1st time no withdrawals...2nd time was suicidal as I stupidly went &#039;cold turkey&#039; - not recommended.  Pupils dilated and some dizziness and sexual dysfunction (I think due to MS though) otherwise great. Day 4 now and already feeling less &#039;freaked out&#039; about everything but complete loss of appetite this time  - not a bad thing after the summer indulgence. Have experienced insomnia this time which I had not previously. Female 37."
