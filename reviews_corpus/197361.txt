"I was on Paxil since I was 16. I didn&#039;t know how good it was until I went off of it 16 years later. Major panic attacks and life felt like it was not worth living! Tried other SSRI&#039;s which didn&#039;t work and made me feel worse! (Zoloft and Pristiq were the worst!) Going back to Paxil. Never should have quit it in the first place! I hope to get the joy I once had back!"
