"I&#039;ve been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder.
My Dr. put me on Celexa 5mg, for a week then 10mg and all the way up to 40 in the next weeks. This medicine has made me feel better already from starting it last week of 5mg. This medicine is a lifesaver for me. I switched from Zoloft. It wasn&#039;t working for me. I will be on Celexa for the rest of my life. Celexa is a awesome for bad anxiety and obsessive thoughts, racing thoughts, worry, panic, PMDD and etc."
