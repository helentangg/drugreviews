"This medicine works very well with me for my mood swings but I have never taken any other drug for mood swings before, but so far so good and the only thing that I can say about side effects is if I forget to take it I feel sick to my stomach and I do become a little agitated but once I take it I am better within in 5 to 10 minutes. Also mixing a pain pill such as Vicodin seems to counteract with the Effexor because it has made me very very irritable. Otherwise as a drug for mood swings and anxiety it works great!"
