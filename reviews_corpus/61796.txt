"Citalopram works exceptionally well long term BUT please be aware of the side affects for the 1st month or two. After suffering crippling panic attacks due to stomach problems I was prescribed 20mg Citalopram daily. For the next 6 weeks my anxiety and panic got far worse which has been the worst experience of my life by far.   Found myself at the doctors surgery or a hospital everyday trying to get some help, even begging to be admitted to a mental hospital. Finally I was given some diazepam, this did help short term which then allowed the Citalopram to kick in. After 3/4 months I felt myself feeling better by the day. Doctors though do not tell you that you that when you start taking Citalopram your symptoms magnify for a time so be aware"
