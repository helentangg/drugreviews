"I am an Active Duty female Soldier - my husband is deployed  - and I have 2 children one with autism - and yes I am a Soldier - and with certain events happening I was losing it bad. After 6 months my doctor increased my dosage to 40mg. It&#039;s been a week with the increase and I feel better. I am tired all the time and forgetful. I have to make lists - but I am dealing with it and going to therapy - try it - it does work."
