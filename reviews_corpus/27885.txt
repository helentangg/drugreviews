"I&#039;ve experienced major depression along with high anxiety. Lexapro has been FANTASTIC for me in helping to get rid of my depression AND helping my anxiety significantly. I&#039;ve tried Prozac, and compared to the two Lexapro has given me much less side effects, has not interacted with other drugs I take, works faster, and has given me my life back. Overall, I think anyone who is suffering with depression, but also has high anxiety can definitely benefit from this drug. It&#039;s been great for me and I think it&#039;s worth a shot for anyone who isn&#039;t having much luck with other SSRIs."
