"I am 58 years old and had headache since I was 7. I had taken tons of pain killers, had seen so many specialists and under taken numerous tests. Recently I did botox on my forehead on 2 occasions, none worked! I was desperate not knowing what to do. I had stomach pain too because of too much ibuprofen, aspirin and so on. My rectum suffered as well, as I frequently used diclofenac suppository. Now it is about 2 months I am on amitriptyline. Started at 10 and now at 75mg and it worked. Yes I am now living headache free, can you believe it. Thanks to my dear GP, and of course AMITRIPTYLINE."
