"I had developed severe anxiety and depression in my late teens/ early 20&#039;s and like many before me I have tried wellbutrin, paxil, lexapro etc. This is the only medicine that has shown significant improvement on both my depression and anxiety. I can be myself again. Don&#039;t be ashamed to talk to your doctor or family member. Get help as soon as possible."
