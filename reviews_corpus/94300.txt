"Was prescribed Brintellix after being on Effexor for years and years, and it stopped doing it&#039;s job.   Started at the 5mg dose for 2 weeks, then to 10, and then to 20.  The first week I had more energy and a very euphoric mood.  I also became kind of impulsive and jittery (is installing broomstick holders in the utility room at 2:00am normal?).  At 10mg my anxiety started increasing, and at 20mg my anxiety was almost debilitating.  Talked to my doctor and she is switching me to something else.  I&#039;m sure it&#039;s a great med, but just not for me unfortunately"
