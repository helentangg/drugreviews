"For the past year and half I have been on Cymbalta. This medicine has made a significant amount of difference. It helps a lot with depression and nerve pain.

Working with a dedicated nurse practitioner and medical team they make a difference. She is a pleasure to work with and provides options for her patients.

The Cymbalta reduces the nerve pain. It helps with depression and anxiety. Thank you for the awesome recommendation and support."
