"I saw my doctor after the anxiety I&#039;d been having the last year hit an all time high in the last six months. I would wake up wondering &quot;Why? What am I even here for? what am I working for?&quot; I suffered severe muscle tension in my shoulders and lower back, extreme irritability/mood swings &amp; panic attacks..my heart would be POUNDING as if I&#039;d run a 5k when really I was just lying in bed. It is day two of taking Zoloft...I&#039;m singing (still terribly) to songs again. I feel I have gained the sense of &quot;normal&quot; that my life has always lacked. I am more clear-headed and find rational thinking easier. My depression and anxiety was destroying my relationships. I&#039;m beginning to see this &quot;light at the end of the tunnel&quot; people speak of. 50mg a day."
