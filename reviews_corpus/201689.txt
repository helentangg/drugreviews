"Ignore all negative comments, it stopped me from taking this medicine for two years. I was unable to work, drive, fly, function. Panic attacks, exhausted all my life. Sporty, lived for exercise, tried CBT. Am pill phobic. 
My life was a mess so I worked with a great doc starting very slowly and here I am 6 months later and I&#039;m a new person. No panic, mild anxiety every now and then like normal people but I&#039;m manageable. Please do it. It&#039;s a wonderful medicine, no side effects and it&#039;ll change your life. Start living."
