"I have taken Celexa for 3 years and my anxiety attacks completely went away! It worked so well that I thought I had overcome this disorder and so I stopped taking it. Big mistake! After a few months of being off the medication and switching careers after 5 years my anxiety attacks came back with a vengeance! I resumed taking Celexa after 3 weeks of constant attacks. After being on the medication for about 3-4 weeks my attacks have completely went away and the tiny bit of anxiety that flares up quickly vanishes. I can honestly say Celexa has changed my life or the better!"
