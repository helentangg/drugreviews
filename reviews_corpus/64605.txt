"At first I lost a little weight probably from the nausea in the beginning.  Yes, It did seem to help my anxiety.  But, as time went on I steadily gained 20lbs in the 9 months I was on this.  I was always a healthy weight for my height.  Now I am chunky.  I tapered off slowly with my doctor&#039;s help.  I&#039;ve been off sertraline for 3 months.  I have exercised daily, 30-45 min runs 5-7 days a week, I have upped my protein and cut calories, my weight has not budged.  There is no doubt in my mind that this AD destroyed my metabolism.  I&#039;m not giving up and will continue to diet and exercise. I would never recommend this ssri to anyone unless they are fine with getting fat.  I wish my dr had advised me of this. :("
