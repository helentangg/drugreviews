"I have been taking Paxil for 5 months. My anxiety had gotten so bad that my wife took me to the ER at 3AM thinking I was having heart issues. I visited my doctor shortly after that and he prescribed Paxil. After a few days of taking it, I felt so much better - finally, relief! I didn&#039;t even realize I had so many symptoms of anxiety until I was on Paxil. I feel better than I have in two years. HOWEVER, there are sexual side effects (decreased sex drive and difficulty achieving erection and ejaculation). Since I&#039;m a newly married man in my mid-twenties, these side effects are very frustrating. Other than that, this drug has been very effective in treating my anxiety."
