"After living with horrible PMS symptoms for over 2 years, a doctor diagnosed me with PMDD. I had 3 weeks of pure hell and 1 week (my period) of feeling semi-normal. The mood swings were so intense, I felt like it wasn&#039;t me. I could feel myself getting emotional but I could not stop it. It was like I was outside looking back at myself. Extreme highs and extreme lows. I was violent and unstable. 
After about a month of being on the meds (25mg) I felt more normal than I had in 2 years. They really saved me. 6 months in (1pill a day) I am back to being myself. 
Side effects I have had: decreased sexual desire, dry mouth, some bouts of mild depression, dry mouth, nausea.
I&#039;m very happy with the medication."
