"After my baby in 2012 I felt depressed and had severe anxiety. My dr put me on Lexapro and it was the most horrible medicine to come off of. I had the worst withdrawal symptoms I felt like a drug addict. The meds made me feel more depressed when I was being tapered off so much that my Dr had to put me on Prozac for two weeks to taper me off the Lexapro. Thankfully it worked and I didn&#039;t have any side effects from the Prozac I just stopped taking them and I&#039;ve been fine ever since. I wouldn&#039;t recommend this med to anyone unless u plan on taking it the rest of ur life bcuz u will become dependent on it."
