"I started using Zoloft one and a half years ago.  It definitely helped my mood, especially anxiety and depression.  I also have a much more stable mood throughout my day.  It did cause me to gain weight when I started taking it, but I was not eating enough prior to taking the medicine.  Occasionally, I would get headaches and after a while my body started having panic attacks again.  But for the first year at least, I would say it was the perfect medication"
