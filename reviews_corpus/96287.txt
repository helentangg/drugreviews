"I&#039;m a 21 year old /male. I started to have severe panic attacks. I smoked marijuana heavily for years and had a stressful situation a year prior to the attacks.  I&#039;ve been taking Zoloft for 7 months now and I want to wean myself off it. I take 100 mgs. It works to an extent but I think the rest is all in my head. When I first started I felt tired all the time but that passed... and after a month I could barely ejaculate and its been like for this for months.  I want my libido back."
