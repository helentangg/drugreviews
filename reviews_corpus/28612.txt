"I have struggled with severe generalized anxiety disorder and social anxiety my entire life and now, at 24, I am just starting to realize how much it has affected my ability to live and enjoy life. I was started on Lexapro while overseas and suffering from depression due to the cold, rainy climate. I cannot tell you how much this medication has changed my life. I am now getting to know the confident, relaxed person that was hiding underneath my anxiety. I am only on 5 mg/ day but I have found that dose to be effective for me. Anything over 5 mg and I start to feel side effects like fatigue and marked decrease in libido. "
