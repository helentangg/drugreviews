"This was the third medication I tried for my depression and anxiety. I&#039;m not going to lie, the entire time I was on it I felt like I was on Ecstasy 24/7. Everything was rainbows and sunshine and I felt so euphoric and amazing and warm and fuzzy. However, I had the nastiest headaches constantly, and they came on as soon as I&#039;d take the meds. Almost the entire time I felt so nauseous and I had migraines and it didn&#039;t let up. I switched at my monthly appointment because the headaches made the euphoria not worth it."
