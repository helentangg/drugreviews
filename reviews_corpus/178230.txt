"I started taking Cymbalta a year ago. Side effects - nausea and pain in stomach. This was with 30mg. Doctor recommended 60mg. It really worked but after about 4 months I just could not afford it so my doctor prescribed Celexa. I used that for several months. I noticed that my usual mild lower back pain returned. (I suffered no withdrawal symptoms). I got back on Cymbalta 2 months ago.  "
