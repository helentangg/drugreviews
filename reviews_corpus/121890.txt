"Effexor XR changed my life. Before I was on it, I suffered from constant unremitting generalized anxiety and deep, dark depressive episodes.  150mg Effexor XR gave me my life back.  over the years I had to increase my dose, ultimately ending up at 450mg. Unfortunately after year 9 it pooped out on me altogether. How I wish it would come back! A great antidepressant. All side effects for me went away within the first few weeks. Now giving Pristiq a try. "
