"I&#039;ve been taking this medication for 3 weeks. First week I was on 30 mg, I felt almost immediate relief from my anxiety/depression. The first six days I experienced fatigue and slept 12  hours a day. By 7th day I was sleeping less and feeling more emotionally balanced. Second week, my dosage was increased to 60 mg and the same thing happened. I slept 12  for about 6 days and by the 7th day I felt good and was sleeping normally. I do have some clenching of my jaw and dry mouth, but a glass of water seems to help. I take my medication at the same time every morning after eating and drink lots of water throughout the day. I&#039;m not taking any other drugs.  I&#039;ve found great relief with Cymbalta. My husband is thrilled with the calmer, happier me. Me too!"
