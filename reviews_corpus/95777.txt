"25 yr old woman UK., I was very low for 3 and a half years, I didn&#039;t really realize i was getting more and more depressed until the past 6 months, and 4 months ago I found it hard to get out of bed or talk! Being shy and anxious as well it was really hard to pluck up the courage to go to my doctor, Which was embarrassing as I just cried and cried in his office and he wasn&#039;t very concerned and put me on citalopram 20mg, this wasn&#039;t very helpful and I did feel zombie like. I decided to stop using it after 3 months but then I got really REALLY depressed and went to a different doctor who put me on sertraline 50mg, its been close to 2 weeks and I feel like I&#039;m actually getting better. A more supportive doctor was nearly as good as this, for me."
