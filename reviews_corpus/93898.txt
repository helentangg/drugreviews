"I started on Trintellix at 10mg and after about 6 weeks I feel like I still didn&#039;t feel it was helping a whole lot. A few weeks ago my Primary Dr said to up it to 20mg then and that same week I found out when getting my annual through the OBGYN that my Thyroid medication that I&#039;ve been on for a good 5 years had to be increased from 25Mcg to 50Mcg about 2 weeks ago. The primary Dr was going to take over and check how the thyroid medication was doing in about 8 weeks. So I&#039;m not sure if having this thyroid problem right now, if that&#039;s way the Trintellix hasn&#039;t really kicked in for me or not? They say if your having thyroid problems it can cause depression and anxiety. So I guess I&#039;ll just have to wait and see?"
