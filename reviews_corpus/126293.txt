"I started taking Viibryd almost a month ago. I&#039;m taking the 28th dose tonight. I&#039;ve tried Zoloft, Celexa, Paxil and none have worked as good and fast. I noticed changes in the first week. I felt great. No worries no anxiety or depression. About a week ago I started to feel a tingling that would run through my whole body. It would get more intense, the longer I kept my eyes closed."
