"I started taking this drug to battle mild depression.  50mg a day.

Pros:
1) more energy than usual.  I go to the gym more than I used to (losing weight).  I go the &quot;extra mile&quot; at work, I got a promotion (financial industry/hedge funds).  2) depression started to fade 

Cons: 1) DR told me to take it before bed. INSOMNIA was so severe I switched to morning. 2) no desire for sex. 3) I started to feel numb, not literally.  Stuff I care about, I no longer do.  This is where the depression starts to fade (partly). Hard to explain this one... 4) I&#039;m alienating myself from friends. I like spending time alone, but I&#039;m spending even more so now. 5) I have to take Ativan before bed from time to time due to extra energy"
