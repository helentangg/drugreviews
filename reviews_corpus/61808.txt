"I was prescribed this drug a few years ago for mild depression. The first time I had no real side effects except nausea for a few days. I was on it for 6 months. 

About a month ago I went to the Dr for my PMS symptoms and he decided to try it again. This time I had no appetite for 2 weeks. I felt sick every time I ate. Very tired and not wanting to do anything. I also still have diarrhoea every morning. I&#039;m becoming dehydrated. Other than that I feel great, except now I have zero sex drive. My husband is suffering because of this. Even if I try and get into it I can&#039;t orgasm. It&#039;s hard to decide if the good outweighs the bad. I&#039;m probably going to switch meds."
