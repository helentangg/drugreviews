"I have major depression, anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder.  Most of the meds I tried over the last 14 years made me gain huge amounts of weight, killed my sex drive, had me twitching as I tried to sleep, or I had insomnia.  I found that to keep the worst side effects (not sleeping/poor sleep) at bay, I had to take lower doses that were barely managing my depression and anxiety and I was still gaining weight and had no sex drive.  My new dr. suggested Viibryd.  I had minor GI issues and gas the first couple weeks but those have gone.  I am on 20mg/day and feel wonderful. I feel normal. No side effects!  Seems from the reviews this is a love it or hate it medication.  I would recommend that anyone at least try it. "
