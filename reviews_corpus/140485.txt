"I started this medication almost 6 weeks ago.  I wanted to post my experience since I have relied on others to help me during this tough time.  At 4.5 weeks I started to notice a &#039;lift&#039;.  Since then almost every day has been good (clear, no more racing heart, calmer, happier, less ruminating)...I seem to have minor set backs in the evening and weekends ---probably because I have more time to think.  Overall I am seeing improvement and hope to continue to get better.

My anxiety was sudden due to stress at work, son going off to college, etc.  The anxiety followed the stress with numb in hands, heartburn, racing heart.  I thought I had MS but it was ruled out with brain MRI.  The symptoms continued until I was diagnosed with GAD."
