"I have been taking Citalopram for about 6 months. It has helped me with my depression bit I seem to have a reduced sex drive and am unable to orgasm and get a headache before I orgasm. My lover can&#039;t stand this and thinks it is her fault (not good enough). I have no problems getting an erection and keeping one. Just have a problem reaching orgasm. Plus the head pain is bad taking the pleasure away."
