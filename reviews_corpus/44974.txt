"I have been suffering from anxiety and paranoia for about 6 months now. The past month has been extreme with constant thought that I&#039;m going to die, when health wise I&#039;m perfectly fine besides needing to lose a few pounds. It has gotten to the point where every ache and pain makes me think something is wrong with me and that I&#039;m going to die. I fear being alone with my 8 months old the most. I fear something will happen to me and nobody will know and my baby will be alone in the house until daddy gets home. I tried almost everything except medicine because I am scared of side effects. Prescribed fluoxetine 20mg. I&#039;ve had the prescription for 2 weeks and been holding off. I finally gave in and started today. Your posts give me hope."
