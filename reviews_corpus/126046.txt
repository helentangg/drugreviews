"I&#039;m a 29 yr old mother of 3. 2 are twin toddlers. I dealt with anger since my teenage yrs. Yelling, tantrums, uncontrollable anger. Many times there would be no reason or very minor ones. Even as an adult I would sit in my closet and tear my clothes down and scream until I felt better. Trying to hide this unhealthy release of anger. Finally I got to where I would stay at home. My doctor diagnosed me with depression. I didn&#039;t believe her but took her advise. We started the beginners pack. 10mg/7days, 20mg/7days then onto 40mg. The first couple of days of each new mg comes with some nausea. EAT WELL! 6 Months later and I am so happy. No more yelling at kids/hubby. Saved my marriage. DO NOT MISS A DOSE EVEN BY AN HOUR. YOU WILL BECOME A MONSTER."
