"I have severe depression and anxiety. Tried one other anti-depressant with disastrous results.  Changed Doctors and changed to Pristiq. Wow! I could tell the difference within the week.  Six weeks later I feel wonderful, now I realize how depressed I really was. No major side effects, a little headache occasionally, but nothing compared to life without Pristiq.  Everything is clearer, calmer, and I am coping really well.  It makes therapy more effective.  Life is great."
