"Lexapro works good for me.  Started on 10mg for a couple of years then needed to up dose to 20mg a day and has been working great for 6 years. I recently took myself off the medication for about three weeks because I have gained weight and wanted to loss some but I quickly asked my doctor to give it back. I will live with the weight and work harder to loss it."
