"Amazed that this is working so well for me &amp; so quickly. I&#039;ve been suffering from horrible hot flashes (2  per hour) of everyday for 8 years now. I noticed relief from Paxil in 2 days. I couldn&#039;t believe it. Like many, I&#039;ve tried EVERY THING imaginable for some relief, (to avoid the dangers of HRT).  Now night sweats are down to 1 per night at most (compared to 5  per night). All I do is wash sheets, night clothes &amp; pillows. Only problem with the Paxil is how groggy I feel the next day. Now I&#039;m taking it a few hours before bed now hoping this will help. After 3 days I think this is helping some. Won&#039;t stop trying to make this medicine work."
