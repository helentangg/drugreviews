"I had left S I joint pain for 8 yrs been to a million drs, tried a million remedies. But my dr put me on Cymbalta. A few days later I ended up in ER with excruciating pain. But when they added a shot of Lorazepam the pain I&#039;d had for years went away. For 9 months, with the combo of Cymbalta 60mg and Lorazapam 2 mg I was completely pain free, but after 9 months the effectiveness has waned. I still take both meds to take the edge off the pain but nothing else really works. Except when I was told I had Fibromyalgia and night sweats and I found out those are caused by LYME DISEASE. Luckily I found a LYME LITERATE DR who is treating me."
