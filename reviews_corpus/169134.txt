"I&#039;m so happy to see that many people have had positive results from this medication.

I was on it for 5 days and had diarrhea so bad I had to stop.  I lost 5 pounds in 2 days (granted I&#039;d like to lose a few, but not like that).  I&#039;ve been off of it for 1 day now and I&#039;m still running to the bathroom (it&#039;s not as bad, but painful).

I wish I would have had the experience others have had. But this drug just isn&#039;t for me.  Unfortunately, it seems that most antidepressant cause a number of side effects for me.  Keeping me stable is a challenge.  (I have bi-polar disorder)"
