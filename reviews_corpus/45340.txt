"I have taken Prozac/flouxetine off and on for a few years to treat bulimia. It truly allows you to lead a normal life again without your day being consumed by thoughts of food and binging/purging. I have always been my physically healthiest when I was taking my 40 mg daily. I would, however, wean myself off eventually due to the sexual dysfunction and a lack of feeling emotions, as well as feeling like I had beaten the bulima - only to have it return full-fledged within 1 1/2 - 2 months. That is the case now, so I&#039;m going back on it. It is still important to get cognitive therapy, so that you may control it on your own if Prozac&#039;s effects eventually wear off for you. Don&#039;t use it as a bandaid for the problem."
