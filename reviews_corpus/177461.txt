"23yo M -  This medication is a god send for me in complete honesty. I have had problems with GAD for around 4 years. Previously I&#039;ve tried Citalopram which was effective for treating my issues, but had side effects in my sexual life which was not possible to overcome. I tried Venlafaxine which was similarly effective but also had the same side effects - took too long rather than nothing at all! I gave up on the current generation of anti-depressant medication before trying Duloxetine. This is in the same category as Venlafaxine although not as strong. I&#039;ve gone straight from VF into Duloxetine and after 20 days have found this medication to be extremely effective. More than any other SSRI or SNRI. For once I feel like a normal person!"
