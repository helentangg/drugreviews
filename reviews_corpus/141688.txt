"I&#039;m not sure what mg I took... but the 1st day I took a whole pill and became very aggressive (not in my character at all). I figured the whole dose may have been too much and took 1/2 pill the next day.  I was less aggressive, but very verbally abusive and extremely irritable. I stopped taking it. "
