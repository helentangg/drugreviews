"I started  Paxil after telling my doctor I had general anxiety and the medication worked after two weeks. At the time my anxiety wasn&#039;t high but it was a level 3 out of 10 so the medication helped out. I was able to be more social and worry less traveling around NYC, but I noticed that I started to gain weight which sucked. After 6 months I wanted to come off because I noticed i never really needed it and this was the hard part. Coming off it was horrible! It made me have higher anxiety without it, and it was anxiety I never experience before. I&#039;ve been off for 4 months and I still haven&#039;t felt the same since before taking Paxil. I&#039;d really recommend taking any medication like Paxil if you really need for panic attacks or high anxiety."
