"I have been taking Pristiq for 2 months now. Within 2 weeks I felt a major difference when I wake up in the morning and throughout the day. I have suffered from depression and anxiety for years without treatment. Pristiq is the first antidepressant I have been on and I can&#039;t believe I have gone this long without it."
