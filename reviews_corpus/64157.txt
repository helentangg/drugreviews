"I was prescribed Lustral for stress and anxiety symptoms 15 years ago. I take 25mg most days and 50mg when I expect more stress. For me it has worked brilliantly, I&#039;m a successful person and I suppose that have built a lot of my achievements on the steady mental base that this medication has helped me to maintain. Before I spent so much mental energy worrying about the future and my ability to deal with potential catastrophic situations (I was imagining). Point of fact the worst periods of my life have all been when I stopped taking it. Maybe, if I had a less pressured career/home/hobbies and had taken a different route in life I wouldn&#039;t have needed it but I like my vocation and my life - so this works for me :)"
