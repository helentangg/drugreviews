"I am updating my last 8 star review of a week or 2 ago below in thread.

Update:  The sleep disruption/insomnia  (oftentimes waking 2-4 am and not getting back to sleep) subsided after 3 weeks of starting the generic form of Lexapro (on 10 mg for almost a month).   I am sleeping well again without assistance from Xanax.  I haven&#039;t taken X in 5 nights and sleeping my usual 7 hours.  It&#039;s wonderful.  No anxiety either.  Give this drug a chance if you can stick out the sleep problems.  It works.  I feel myself again and am not worrying over worrying about anxiety. Not afraid to go anywhere, for fear I&#039;d get that old sense of dread and unease.  I don&#039;t even think about it.  It doesn&#039;t matter the time of day you take it by the way."
