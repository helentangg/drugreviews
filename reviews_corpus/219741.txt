"After surgery to remove a kidney I developed IBS mixed. I was missing so much work and school and it only got worse as I got older. After moving I saw a new digestive health Dr. He put me on this with Levsin, omg the change was almost immediate. Within a week I was so much better. I&#039;ve been on them for about a year now and I still have a couple episodes once every 3 months or so but it&#039;s managed and controlled now. If I forget to refill or skip a dose, I suffer within 12 hours of the missed dose."
