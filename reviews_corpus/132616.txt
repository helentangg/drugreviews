"Excellent sleep aid. I would get up in the middle of night two to three times. I had taken Ambien with terrible results (getting up and eating and not remembering things I did when I woke up). Tried Silenor and it helps me sleep during the night. I still may get up once to go to bathroom but go back to sleep right after that. Great medicine and recommend to any one who has trouble staying asleep."
