"I started taking this medicine when I was 16.  I am 26 now.  Right now I take 100mgs.  I was an unhappy teenager and I can&#039;t say it did anything for me at that point in my life (but I was only taking 50mgs then).  I stayed on Zoloft all through college and only went off of it for about 6 months, at the urging of a boyfriend at the time.  Those months were bad.  I tried everything to feel better (exercise, meditation, different activities) but I always felt like there was blackness hanging over everything.  I couldn&#039;t function socially and became rather reclusive.  With the help of my therapist and psychiatrist, I went back on Zoloft and my depressive symptoms decreased dramatically.  I have been on Zoloft for 10 years now so it&#039;s just a part of my life.  I get sad sometimes, but when I get hopeless feelings I can process them more easily.  It&#039;s hard for me to imagine life without Zoloft, but I hope to someday regulate my depression with a therapist and go off of it.  That said, I don&#039;t really have any side-effects to speak of.  Sometimes I have a low sex drive, but its only at certain times of the month, like before my period.  However, having a diminished sex drive on antidepressants is easier than not having any drive whatsoever when you are off them. To me, taking Zoloft is almost like taking a vitamin. It&#039;s no big deal."
