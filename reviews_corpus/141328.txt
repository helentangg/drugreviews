"I relate to many people&#039;s experience here - this medicine is saving my life!
Had the works, lifetime of depression, have battled through nervous breakdowns. Recently building up to full blown panic attacks.
It&#039;s making me feel good in a way I&#039;ve NEVER FELT! 
It&#039;s even reduced the pain on my nervous system from the chronic illness (autoimmune) that I&#039;ve had since a teen. 
I wish I&#039;d had this decades ago. (Had to get through a week of side effects, but they were bearable. Just a bit of dizziness, nausea and clenched muscles. Now my body&#039;s adjusted, my appetite is back, and I&#039;m actually feeling stronger than I&#039;ve felt in a LONG time."
