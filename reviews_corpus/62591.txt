"I started taking Celexa almost a month ago after having gone off Lexapro because (of course) I thought I was feeling good and thought maybe but I went back down the rabbit hole of my depression which has been with me for most of life.  I was worried about Celexa after reading a lot of message boards but I have experienced virtually no side effects - just a little blurred vision and sleepiness at first but that went away.  I feel so much better.  I feel even and stable and positive and the best part is that my libido has actually INCREASED which is incredible because Lexapro worked well but kind of ruined my ability to &quot;finish&quot; so I think everyone is different and it&#039;s all about finding the right cocktail.  Good luck everyone!"
