"I was given Prozac a couple years ago for depression and never really took them thinking I wasn&#039;t depressed. Now years later I ended up trying them again, and I will tell you that life is so much better! I was always stressing about everything and picking myself apart, my marriage is going through a rough spot on forgiving my husband. Without the help of Prozac I would dwell on things that made me upset, now I have a great outlook on my life and I actually can give a second chance to my husband that he deserves. I&#039;m a much happier person, this medicine is wonderful and I feel like a new person."
