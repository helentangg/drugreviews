"I really like it! No sexual side effects at all! I have been on several other antidepressants and this is the only one without sexual side effects I have tried. I did not notice any side effects going on it.  I was going off Effexor at the same time, going off the Effexor was hard. Brain zaps! 
I have no complaints about this med.  I am on thehighest dose 120 mg , started at 30mg"
