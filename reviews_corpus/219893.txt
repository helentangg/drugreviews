"I been suffering with fibromyalgia for 6 years diagnosed officially for two. I have IBS, RLS, Insomnia, depression and anxiety as side effects.I&#039;ve been through the mill trying to find something that works to ease it. Had a winning combination of tramadol and mirtazapine taken on a night which eased the pain symptoms so I could sleep. However it didn&#039;t help with the pain but I could live with that. My Dr. decided that I couldn&#039;t and took me of tramadol and put me on amitriptyline and much like it&#039;s name I felt like I&#039;d tripped. I was awake but had no control over my limbs I could still feel the pain the twitches. I felt like I was locked out of my brain and someone else was at the wheel. I will never take it again."
