"I&#039;ve been taking Effexor for 5 years now for depression. As far as my mood goes, it works wonders. I&#039;m a completely different person and its awesome. As far as side effects go, I have had some sexual ones, concentration issues and short term memory problems. I&#039;d rather deal with those than the depression though and if I forget to take one, or can&#039;t afford to get them right away, all hell literally breaks lose. I get dizzy, emotional and aggravated. All I want to do is cry and sleep. "
