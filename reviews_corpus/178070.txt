"I have fibromyalgia and have slowly got worse over the years. I took Cymbalta 30mg for the first week, suffered a naggy headache for 3 days, but could still work. Pain gone in a week, completely. The only side effect I have is tightening of the throat, which I can live with. Unfortunately the snoring my husband can&#039;t. I went to the doctors today and he has put me on Pristiq to see if this stops the tight throat. If not I will go back onto Cymbalta. These had such an amazing effect on my life."
