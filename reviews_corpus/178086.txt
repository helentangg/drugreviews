"I&#039;ve been taking Cymbalta 30mg for almost 2 weeks now for depression and anxiety. My doctor said this is a very low dose which is why I feel only a minor improvement. Before this, I have taken Prozac, Wellbutrin, Zoloft, Trazodone, Buspar, Paxil, and several others. With all of them, they either had no effect or made me feel worse. Plus their side effects ranged anywhere from inconvenient to nearly debilitating. Cymbalta is the first medicine that I haven&#039;t suffered from any side effects at all. The next time I meet with my doctor, I&#039;m going to see if she will increase my dosage."
