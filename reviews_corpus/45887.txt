"I have depression. Prozac did not help me. After 4 weeks and several side effects, the only positive experience was the fact that I didn&#039;t feel anything &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;good&quot;. The worst was the major lack of motivation and loss of all interest in what I enjoyed in life. That was kind of the problem before the medicine. This is my second day off Prozac and I feel better each day. Good luck all."
