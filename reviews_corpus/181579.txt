"I started on 10 mg of Prozac for 6 months.  After 5 mos I noticed getting agitated and very angry at my past childhood traumas, ruminating again and wanting to change my family name.  It got so bad that I went up in dose and now I feel it doesn&#039;t matter as much.  I am positive, sleep like a baby, have energy and enthusiasm."
