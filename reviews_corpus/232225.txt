"My physician prescribed me 20mg of paxil daily when I saw her for anxiety/depression.

The first couple of days I had trouble sleeping and had a lot of energy, but no anxiety.  This drug definitely reduced my anxiety and I felt more sociable, but after a month or so I noticed that I couldn&#039;t focus and I started to lose motivation to do anything and had no energy.  I felt more depressed than before I had started the medication, and on my days off from work I would end up sleeping all day.

Quit cold turkey whike taking 5-htp and experienced the brain zaps for a couple days, but now I feel like myself again.   I can&#039;t recommend this med.  I think exercise and good diet are more effective at improving my mood."
