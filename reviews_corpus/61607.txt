"Have been on this for 8 days now , still struggling to eat ( having to force myself )  , only getting 3 hours sleep and they blooming lucid dreams and hands and head always hot when in bed , spaced out a bit but do feel a little calmer just really wish the side effects would go away , giving it another 6 days then I&#039;ll need to stop so hopefully they go away .....just my experience tho please don&#039;t let it affect yours they are worth a try"
