"I started taking Pristiq about 3 1/2 weeks ago to help with stress and anxiety.  I have had mild headaches and a little bit of nausea. I immediately feel sleepy when I take it so I am taking it at night before bed. I do think that I am sleeping more through the night than before. I have tried a few other medication&#039;s such as Zoloft and Prozac.  I felt very sedated, no sex-drive, wanted to sleep all the time (before kid&#039;s) really could not even cry if I wanted to.  I also gained 40lbs which made things worse.  I am still questioning myself if I really need medication or just accept the fact that I cannot have a house with everything in place with young kid&#039;s and that not everyone is going to be as kind as I think they should."
