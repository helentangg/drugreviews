"Irritable Bowel Syndrome sufferer for years.  Amitriptyline works really well for me.  There are still certain foods I avoid and I very occasionally get a flare up (normally because I have either over eaten or eaten something I would normally avoid).  I take 20mg at night time, I did try to reduce this down to 10mg but after a couple of weeks all my symptoms were back, pain, bloating, constipation, etc.  I&#039;d advice anyone suffering to give it a go.  It took several weeks of taking it before I experienced significant relief of symptom.  Although I read that for some people it works straight away.  Hope this helps."
