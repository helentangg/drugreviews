"I was on Cymbalta for 5 days. It helped my anxiety, but I couldn&#039;t handle the side effects: nausea, extreme sleepiness and yawning for the better part of the day, feeling zombie-like, chills, clenching my jaw, headache. I stopped taking it after 5 days, and the withdrawal was terrible. I felt like I&#039;d been hit my a truck: terrible headache and clenching of jaw. And I&#039;d only been on 30 mg for 5 days. Even if I could have tolerated the side effects, I would have been worried about the withdrawal."
