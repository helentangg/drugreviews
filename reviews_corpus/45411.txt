"Very good treatment option it was my first SSRI and I was taking it for Anxiety and other stress I couldn&#039;t handle, as well as some therapy and coping mechanisms this medicine is great. I take 10 mg and even that is enough to get rid of anxiety however it does make you lose your sex drive and can make you completely lose Interest in any sexual activity, but all in out its a good treatment."
