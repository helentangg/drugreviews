"I&#039;ve never been a depressed person until now. I call it a situational depression. I tried to handle it on my own at first but got so tired of crying all the time decided I needed help, something to get me over the hump. So, I&#039;ve been on Pristiq for about a month. At first I felt like I was in a Benadryl haze for about a week. Just felt strange. One night about a week ago I woke up with the worst night sweats I&#039;ve ever had, like I just ran 10 miles. Drenched! I could have wrung out my shirt, gross. I also have zero appetite. I wasn&#039;t hungry until about 5:00 today and just had half of a salad. I seem to get full fast. As far as my mood, much better. I&#039;m not crying my eyes out everyday which is so refreshing. I feel less anxious."
