"Taken fluoxotine before, medication free for 4 years, I remember why I stopped. I know it&#039;s not a magic cure and that the first few weeks will always make you feel worse before you start improving but I would never take this again. Sweating, increased anxiety, violent mood swings, weight loss, crying, loss of appetite and an Ambulance trip to A and E due to kidney failure (which I have never suffered before)   nearly 2 weeks off this and my kidney funtions are slowly returning to how they should be.  A lot of time off work however which is now a whole new stress with loss of money and what is increasingly seemingly an addiction to codeine. 
PLEASE to anyone taking these, be careful x"
