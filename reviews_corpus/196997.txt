"I&#039;ve suffered from depression for the past ten years, and terrible anxiety since a very young age (especially social anxiety). I&#039;ve never truly felt happy for any significant period of time.  My anxiety can be so severe that I can&#039;t even leave my house sometimes. Certain noises, crowds, being out in public, can cause me extreme anxiety which leads to anger and irritability. I also battle alcoholism due to my illnesses. I&#039;ve been taking Paxil for two weeks and after only 2 days my anxiety VANISHED. My mood is slowly lifting, and I have no desire at all to drink alcohol!! I&#039;ve even lost weight because I don&#039;t stress eat anymore and my appetite has decreased. The first week or so I did feel drowsy/high, but that feeling is going away slowly."
