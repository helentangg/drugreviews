"My dr put me straight on Desfax/Pristiq (desvenlafaxine) instead of Lexapro hoping that the inhibition of norepinephrine reuptake in addition to the SRI would help with energy and motivation. It was an easy swap, didn&#039;t need to ween off lexapro, and didn&#039;t get any side effects from stopping lexapro or starting pristiq from memory. The first 4 weeks or so felt relatively steady (placebo effect) then out of nowhere had vivid nightmares, snappy/irritated mood out of nowhere (this was new to me I&#039;m not usually that kind of person),I had dangerous/impulsive behaviours, and then it got even worse and it felt like the depression came back in full swing with horrible low moods and crying. No more pristiq.
Now to try a Bupropion &amp; Valdoxen combo."
