"Started Amitriptyline less then six months ago for lingering on going headaches, 25 mg at night.  I see a immunologist for Lupus and fibromyalgia. He sent me to a neurologist, who gave me Amitriptyline.    Helped me tolerate them but they never went away. They made me cranky, irritable, and down right mean. I have muscle weakness, and can not concentrate. Dr. for Fibro wants to increase dose to 100mg.  I don&#039;t see that helping my side effects since the side effects started with this med.  I&#039;m going to see GP for a third opinion and  referral to a Psychiatrist.    This drug is not for everyone. Be careful."
