"I will start off by saying this medicine is very effective and has worked for my light anxiety and depression, and  very excited about it! Like many others that have reviewed, Celexa did make me tired for the first few weeks and did have an impact on my sex drive. Overall I gladly accept the side effects for the calm/relaxed feeling that I have.  It has surprisingly made my meetings at work and public speaking more manageable. I am 34 years old and have tried self-medicating with plenty of sleep and exercise and healthy diet (and positive thinking). After years of &#039;dealing with it&#039; I just asked the doctor for something mild enough to lift me up and he suggested Celexa; and I am so glad he did.  It&#039;s made a difference in my life!"
