"I was diagnosed with Interstitial Cystitis in March of this year. The first few weeks were some of the worst of my life. I changed my diet, was put on Elmiron, Zyrtec and Vesicare with zero relief in any symptoms. Was at the end of my rope when my PCP suggested Elavil.  In 3 days my symptoms were nearly gone. Pain was gone. Urgency/frequency cut in half.  But I immediately started gaining weight. A lot of weight, and fast.  And I am diabetic and any weight gain is very bad for me.  So I&#039;ve had to choose to not take it and live with the pain and constant peeing because I cannot afford to gain any weight due the diabetes.  I&#039;m basically distraught.  Diabetes will kill me, but the Interstitial Cystitis pain is causing major depression.  I am at a loss as nothing else has worked."
