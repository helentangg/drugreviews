"Severe anxiety and debilitating depression - a normal active happy person reduced to nothing but the dark in a bed for months. Prescribed every drug in the book in every combination - twice! All absolutely utterly totally useless. One day my doc said we are going to try an unusual dangerous drug - Nardil, because its your only hope. FANTASTIC UTTERLY INCREDIBLE. In two days I was living again and I was nearly better."
