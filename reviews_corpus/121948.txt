"I was diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder, 10 years ago. I also struggled with panic attacks and depression. I could feel the positive effects of the medicine right away. Because of it&#039;s immediate fix, I would recommend this to someone who is has severe anxiety. The  negative things I can say it is extremely hard to come off of. The withdrawal made me feel like I was crazy.  I took myself off of it to quickly.  I had hallucinations, tremors, and anxiety attacks. So make sure you use your doctor to ween off of it."
