"I,ve been taking citalopram for 2 years after experiencing total burnout and depression. Started on 20mg then up to 40mg and finally began to feel better, tried to ween it down to 10mg but didn&#039;t work. So on 20 mg and feel good and if it means taking a pill everyday for the rest of my life - as long as I never go back to that dark place I will keep taking them. Side effects sweating on my face, tremor in hands and weight gain."
