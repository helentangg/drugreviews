"I&#039;ve struggled with anxiety &amp; depression my entire life, &amp; I was wary of starting sertraline(at age 20) but 50mg a day has changed me for the better. I&#039;m happier, less anxious overall, I got a job, I can do all the things my anxiety wouldn&#039;t allow, like answering the phone, going shopping alone, making small talk with people.  There have been some unpleasant side effects, alcohol puts me right to sleep now. I have no appetite (lost about 15lbs) and my sex drive is noticeably diminished. Whatever you do, do not stop cold turkey. 50mg is a very small dose but the withdrawals are hell. I ran out and couldn&#039;t get a refill for a week, I was cold sweating through my clothes 24/7, shaky, suicidal, dizzy, and my anxiety was worse than before"
