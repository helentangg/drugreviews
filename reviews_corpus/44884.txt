"My story is very long. But to get to the point, Fluoxetine is the ONLY antidepressant that helped me. Brain injury caused my problems with anxiety and depression. I was born highly sensitive to medications. I&rsquo;m VERY thankful for Fluoxetine. I had some side effects in the beginning, and had to work up from 10mg to 60 over a period of a few months. That was very difficult. But, the side effects eventually did go away. I went from the deepest form of depression possible, to a very satisfactory quality of life within a few years. I still struggle with issues related to a brain injured person, but, the Fluoxetine was one of the tools that saved my life. And I&rsquo;m very thankful for this medication. "
