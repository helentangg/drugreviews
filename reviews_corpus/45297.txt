"Changed my life within a month of taking.  initially gave me upset stomach but the wait was worth.  My wife said she &quot;felt like she was walking on egg shells&quot;,  Now more I am relaxed and a better husband.  Sex drive has been affected but I can live with that just being happy and enjoying life again."
