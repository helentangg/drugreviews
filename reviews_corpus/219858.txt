"Been on it since 2008 --went through 5 days  withdraw from OxyContin @  Vicodin by choice by my self in a cabin-yes I had a RX 4 both meds -I was working out of state at the time-coming home every month 4 my legal fix.  I was messed up mentally and physically after I stopped taking meds.  I also quit drinking and smoking cigarettes and weed.  Doctor prescribed tramadol which took a month to kick in. I take 100mg 2 hours before I plan to sleep &amp; Amitriptyline HCL 100 mg.  It is best thing I ever did.  I was self-medicating with the alcohol because I had insomnia ever  since I was a teenager  and now I am 65 years old. The cons-dry mouth in  in the morning no big deal - it&#039;s worth having a good night sleep  no hangover  effects  for me I recommend this medication thank you"
