"I have been prescribed Effexor for over 6 years. Initially it worked great. Now they have made me go on a generic version venafaxine hcl ER. The manufacturer is TEVA. And I have had major anxiety, hives, headaches, can&#039;t sleep, night sweats just to name a few. I have heard from others they can not take the generic form. However, when I requested the Name brand my insurance wouldn&#039;t cover it. In going to fill my prescription it was going to cost $963 to fill. I was shocked. What is a person to do? Is there any help for those of use who can&#039;t take the generic format. And how to we find out what is actually in this to know what we are allergic to? Any help is appreciated..."
