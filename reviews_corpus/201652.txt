"I&#039;ve been on sertraline for almost a year now. On the 25mg I didn&#039;t notice any kind of difference. I was suffering from major depression, self-harm, and suicidal thoughts. My dr bumped me up to a 50mg dose &amp; have stayed here for about 8 months now. My girlfriend calls it my &quot;happy pills&quot; because when I forget to take a dose or two, everyone can tell."
