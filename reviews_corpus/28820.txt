"I took Lexapro from 2005 until about 1 month ago.  I have suffered from depression all of my life and have had bouts of panic attacks at various times.  I got on the Lexapro starting at 10mg but quickly went to 20mg as 10mg didn&#039;t really help.  I did notice a calming effect from the standpoint of anxiety and depression.  On the downside, I have gone from 170 pounds in 2005 to 200 pounds currently.  Also, during some extreme cases I took Xanax during the panic attacks to cope.  
I am now trying to get off the Lexapro. I have taken 10mg for a month or two and now am about 1 month into not taking any.  The problem is, now I have had some very very almost panic attack nights and have had to take the 1mg of Xanax to help. "
