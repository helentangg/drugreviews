"Lexapro changed my life! I am 34 years old. I had coped with generalized anxiety. Everything in my life was affected. I have been on Lexapro 10 mg for four months now and I can&#039;t imagine being without it. I&#039;m happy with my life; work, family, friends. No more anxiety attacks and bad thoughs. My husband can 100 percent see the change. I only had a few side effects for the first few weeks like dizziness and slight night.  At first I was unsure that it was going to work because I can&#039;t think cleraly. But it definitely works after the first three weeks just give it the chance."
