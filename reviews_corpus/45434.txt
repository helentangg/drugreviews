"I was on Sertraline for a year but then I stopped taking sertraline because the medication stopped working and this was causing problems to me and my school life. I have now been prescribed Fluoxetine from my Doctor and I have noticed the side effects instantly such as feeling anxious restlessness. 
The medication has helped with life at home, me and my mum have been getting on better and not arguing my social relationships have improved to an extent but not inside school that is where I am having the problems. which is a main concern for me. 
once I go back to the Doctor in a few weeks time, she expects to see a diary plan of my days and how my mood is changing. I will also explain about my anxieties."
