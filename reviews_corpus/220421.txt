"Started getting migraines at 18. I&#039;m now 46. Vomiting so bad I used to go to hospital 1-2x per month to go on a drip to rehydrate. Made a professional career virtually impossible. Been on Sandomigran for 25 years. Had every possible treatment. Then 5 years ago a hospital locum prescribed Endep. That was the end of my migraines. I was suicidal for 2-3 weeks but then back to normal. I now take 1 x 50mg tab every second night. Endep is brilliant!"
