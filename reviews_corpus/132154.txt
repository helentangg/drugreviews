"I&#039;ve been taking Effexor XR for over a half of a year now. 
PROS: The biggest notice with this medicine is that I have not had a migraine since! I&#039;ve been getting migraines for over five years and the frequency is one migraine every two weeks; not fun at all. Since I have started the Effexor XR I have not gotten a migraine since then, which is very unusual! I also feel more social!

CONS: I had to drop the dose to the minimum since I was a little bit more irritable at times. Also, I am unsure if the Effexor is helping me gain weight or if that&#039;s my fault for the lack of exercising. I started to get TMJ (grinding of the teeth) when I took Effexor with Amitriptyline at night. It stopped since I take Effexor in the morning and the other at night."
