"I was in a car accident and have chronic pain. Amitriptyline takes the edge off. The side effects are dry mouth, confusion, dizziness, nausea and chronic lethargy to name a few. The one that put me off completely is risk of LIVER DAMAGE. My feet have been swelling for 3 weeks. For the last week my calves have been swelling as well.
