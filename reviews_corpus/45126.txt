"I began taking Prozac in January 2016. I started out on 20mg. I noticed a positive difference in my mood (less irritable and happier) after only 1-2 weeks. After about a month I bumped up to 40 mg and things were still great. I did really great on it as far as side effects go, I had none. Things were great for 6 months and then it sort of just stopped working. my doctor bumped me up to 60mg but it did nothing. I built a tolerance for it and recently switched to trintellix. Overall, Prozac worked really great until I built a tolerance for it."
