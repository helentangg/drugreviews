"I wanted to share my experience while being on celexa. Before celexa I was a wreck, having racing thoughts and felt like I couldn&#039;t get out of bed. I&#039;m a mother of two and a happily married wife. I&#039;ve suffered with anxiety for about 6 years and I was so scared to get on medication. It wasn&#039;t until I seen a constant pattern of me going to the emergency room with panic attacks and the hospital staff knew my name as soon as I walked in! Being on celexa has completely changed my life back to the woman I was. It literally gave my mind a clear focus and now I live in the present. Not worrying about a million and one things. Before I couldn&#039;t even communicate because my thoughts would just race and I would be stuck in my own head."
