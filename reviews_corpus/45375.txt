"Horrible experience with Prozac! Started taking it on  a Thursday, and by Saturday had a buzzing in my ears, a full feeling in my head, and couldn&#039;t sleep. On Sunday, I completely lost my appetite, and became very jittery. I was barely able to work on Monday, and called off Tuesday because of generalized anxiety, not sleeping or eating.  I ended up taking three total days off of work due to side effects.  I literally had to force myself to eat a single slice of toast for breakfast... and barely got it down! I finally went off of it on Wednesday and went back on paxil.  By Friday, I am feeling like my old self again.  Plus, I had startling dreams.  I won&#039;t ever take this drug again!"
