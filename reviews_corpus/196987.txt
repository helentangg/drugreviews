"I have OCD, anxiety, and ADHD. I also pick my cuticles everyday. The official name is Dermatillomania and it&#039;s closely related to pulling hair out. I&#039;ve been picking my cuticles for 25 years. There has never been a time when I did not pick them to some degree. I try to hide them and I frequently make them bleed. I take 450 mg of Wellbutrin XL and 25 mg of Paxil (by cutting the pills) daily. 
I started the Paxil almost a month ago for anxiety. While it has helped a lot with anxiety, it&#039;s even more incredible to me that my cuticles are now almost perfect with just one tiny blemish and my nails are long. This is the ONLY time they&#039;ve looked like this since I started when I was 9 years old. Very, very pleased! No more hiding my fingers!"
