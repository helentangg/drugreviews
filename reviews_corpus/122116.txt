"My ob/gyn recently recommended Effexor to treat my menopausal symptoms (hot flashes, anxiety, mood swings) after having my ovary removed.  I was skeptical because I have been treated with anti-depressants in the past and the side effects were horrendous.  I also suffer from GAD and SADD, but because I am such a wimp about taking pills, I have tried to tough it out. I was willing to try anything to help me get better.  It has only been a week at the 37.5 dose, and I already notice a difference.  Hot flashes are gone, I don&#039;t fly off the handle at everything and everyone, I am laughing, I can concentrate, I worry less, and am generally more calm.  Side effects are minimal.  A little spacy at times!  Loss of appetite (which is good for an overweight woman).  LOVE THIS MEDICINE!"
