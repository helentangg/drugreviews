"Hi guys, I was prescribed paroxetine for general anxiety disorder, paranoia and depression. The drug didn&#039;t take effect until about 2 weeks which I quickly was relieved from my symptoms. However I spent a further 2 weeks feeling severe side effects- dizziness, further anxiety, difficulty sleeping and waking up, vivid dreams, lack of orgasm during sex, blurred vision and almost grinning as if I was on uppers.. though these side effects did pass I now only have vivid dreams and occasional nightmares... this drug has worked so well for me and I now feel back to my old self again happy everyday, my anxiety and paranoia have completely gone, I strongly suggest giving it a go but it may not work for everyone as you can read:) LOVE LIFE!!!"
