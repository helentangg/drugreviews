"This medication has turned me around and I had none of the side effects. I initially requested it from my doctor because, whilst I did not really have any problems, I had a negative outlook despite trying to be positive and I was not enjoying &#039;life&#039; at all. 

It has really helped with all this and as an added bonus I feel that I have more energy. I went back to my doctor and said &quot;We hit the nail on the head&quot;. Previously I was looking for the magic vitamin pill to help reduce my stress and increase my energy levels. I tried vitamin B, Iron, and multivitamins to no avail. I no longer feel the need to take any vitamins at all. I&#039;ll continue to take this as needed and have no reservations about taking anti-depressants."
