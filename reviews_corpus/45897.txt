"Wonderful drug but watch out for medication interactions.  Developed Serotonin Syndrome when doctor prescribed Ultram (Tramadol) for pain relief. Caused involuntary muscle spasms, difficulty speaking, walking, etc.  Even looked like I had a stroke.  I tapered off it shortly after and tried other drugs to help with anxiety, depression and PMDD.  I have since come back to Prozac because it works well for me as long as I make sure not to take tramadol or other drugs that can interact with it.  I experience weight loss with this drug. Have tons of energy and sleep well at night."
