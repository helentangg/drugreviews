"I don&#039;t usually write reviews, but I feel obliged to do so for this one. In many ways, Effexor helped with my clinical depression and gave me boost of energy that I otherwise didn&#039;t get with typical SSRIs. 

On the other hand within 2-3 weeks of taking it, I felt a sudden energy boost where I felt like I could do a million things at once. Before I could never wake up in the morning and felt groggy, and then all of a sudden I was up at 5:00am to do yoga 5 days a week. This pattern of hyperactivity continued for on end, until finally I flipped out and became suicidal. At this time I was on 200mg of Effexor and could simply not function without it. After the terrible withdrawal of weaning off, I finally feel relaxed."
