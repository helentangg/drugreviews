"Switched from Citalopram to 75 Mg and then onto 225 Mg Venlaxafine
Worked great to be honest. Got me out and more social
That was until I started getting hives and horrid allergic reactions. Swelling eyes / mouth and breathing problems.
 I denied it to myself initially that it was the pills because I thought they where working so great and I didn&#039;t want to give them up.  Had to face reality though eventually.  Pushed my luck and I got stung. Awoke one morning unable to breath + swelling badly. I ended up having 2 go hospital....so I had to give them up.  Didn&#039;t think withdrawal would be tough to be honest. I thought that I done this many a time on other AD&#039;S and done fine.  Oh boy was I wrong.  The vertigo and brain zaps r by far the worst!"
