"General mood levelling, couldn&#039;t really feel any emotion which became monotonous &amp; unbearable. Also not recommended if you have an eating disorder &amp; cannot always force yourself to have it with food. Caused crippling nausea &amp; copious amounts of excess gas to sit in my stomach, this still hasn&#039;t left after more than a year of stopping. Not for everyone."
