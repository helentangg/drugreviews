"I&#039;ve been taking Effexor XR for 15 months for treatment of depression.  Initially, I wondered if there was a point and if it was making a difference.  I was very skeptical when I ran out during a storm, didn&#039;t receive mail, and my mail service pharmacy prescription arrived late. I felt like my head was &quot;sloshing&quot; and I was very sick to my stomach.  Missing a dose was awful.  But about a year after I began taking it, I noticed that I was back in control of my life and I felt like me but better than I remembered.  My friends say they saw a difference much sooner.  I don&#039;t know if the passage of time, monthly therapy, or the medicine is what helped me get my depression. I&#039;m giving credit to Effexor XR."
