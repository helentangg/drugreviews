"Cymbalta has been an incredible drug for me.  Since taking Cymbalta, I have been able to enjoy life more, sleep less and feeling more refreshed, reduction in pain, and improved memory and concentration.  Recently, I have been studying for an exam.  This is a hard exam, that I previously had failed before, while not taking Cymbalta.  I started taking Cymbalta, approximately in January.  The months leading up to the exam, I was more focused, and able to concentrate better than I can last remember.  I know that Cymbalta doesn&#039;t treat concentration or memory problems, but I think that sometimes if you are depressed, it can have a severe affect on concentration.  Thank you Cymbalta for helping me in my life."
