"I wish it could have worked but this is poison... only took one pill but it made me nauseous for 24h. And I&#039;m not talking about a small discomfort but actual pain, wishing I could puke but didn&#039;t. I spent one of the most awful night of my life. My stomach was really upset, with any kind of food or drinks. I won&#039;t take another pill ever."
