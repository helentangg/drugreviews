"I started taking venlaflaxine for anxiety many years ago. I&#039;ve been absolutely fine and they&#039;ve helped a lot in reducing my anxiety. Only recently they&#039;ve changed them (different colour) and since then i&#039;ve had an upset stomach. I haven&#039;t changed anything else so i&#039;m thinking it must be the new tablets. I&#039;ll carry on taking them for a bit and see what happens."
