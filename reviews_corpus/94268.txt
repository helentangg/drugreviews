"I am on my third month on this medication. I started with 10 mg per day and now take 20. 
My copay is so high I will only be able to take this until I exhaust all means of samples given by Dr&#039;s. 
For the first time in a year I can say I feel pretty normal. I had to cut back to ten Mg for a couple of weeks and was crying almost daily. 
I have nausea, headaches and cravings for sweets. Have gained three pounds!"
