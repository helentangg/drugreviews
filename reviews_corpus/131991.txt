"Hope you are all feeling a least a little bit better having used this medication. I suffer from depression, anxiety and severe neck and lower back pain. I have been on Effexor-XR for almost a year now. In my case, it has been a very good choice of medication, having tried many others.
It has reduced my depression and anxiety considerably, in addition to this, I had over time, developed a social phobia. I was always falling asleep and felt like I was turning into a junkie due to the the oxycontin medicines I was on for pain. Effexor-XR has eased this phobia to a comfortable level, I am now able to go out and feel comfortable around others."
