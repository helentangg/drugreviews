"I was put on Sertraline (Zoloft for USA readers) after a  depressive period. I hit a new low and I needed help immediately. I had taken Mirtazapine for over ten years for insomnia; but it didn&#039;t seem to work anymore and life was intolerable so was put on Sertraline. The first two weeks were difficult: diarrhoea, insomnia (again), dry mouth etc. But after the first week I saw subtle changes, a  month and I was smiling again. It took three months to fully feel the effects and it&#039;s no underestimation to say that it&#039;s changed my life. I sleep every night now, which was unthinkable back then. I&#039;m able to cope and I see a future. Different drugs effect people differently but I have nothing but good things to say about Sertraline."
