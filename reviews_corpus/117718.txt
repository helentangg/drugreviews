"I&#039;ve been using nortriptyline for over 10 years now and my migraine hasn&#039;t caused me severe pains anymore. I noticed that if I ever stop taking the medication, I started getting headaches again. I wanted to stop this medicine because of water retention and weight gain, but this is the only medicine so far that can help me with my migraine headache, and also with my back pain after a spinal surgery. The pros outweigh the cons of taking this medication so I continue to use it up to now."
