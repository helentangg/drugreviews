"I had started with Celexa, then changed to citalopram when it became available. (No changes whatsoever, both meds helped me exactly the same. Citalopram was just cheaper.) I had been in a severely bad personal situation, one that included some abuse. I was in a very bad way, and my anxiety level was at times paralyzing. When I started taking Celexa, my anxiety calmed down considerably, and I was able to see my bad situation for what it was, and I was able to actually deal with it. It&#039;s now years later, and my life is fine now, though I believe my personal situation damaged me enough to where I&#039;m too stressed if I try to go off the medicine, so I stay on it, and that&#039;s fine with me. I believe Celexa quite literally saved my life."
