"I completely stopped having panic attacks after taking this medication for a few months. I had become house-bound by several debilitating panic attacks every day.  I have been on Paxil for close to a year, and it is still working.  Side effects I experienced were bruising for the first few months.  I also experienced numbness and tingling (my arms and legs started falling asleep all the time).  I began taking magnesium supplements and the tingling stopped.  I am still experiencing weight gain and tiredness and constant yawning, as well as decreased focus and memory.  I am also unable to orgasm, which is strange for me because I used to be able to reach orgasm very easily.  Overall, I can work and live again so it&#039;s worth the side effects."
