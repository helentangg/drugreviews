"Started on a new dose of 225mg 9 weeks ago at first didn&#039;t think it was working but slowly each day seems much better. Feel much happier &amp; enjoying life again. This medication does not work over night, it can take a while but don&#039;t give up on them to quickly. Hang on in there &amp; you will see the benefits. The only side affects I had was sweating &amp; vivid dreams but these do subside over time."
