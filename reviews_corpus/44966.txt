"I was on prozac for mild depression and mild OCD.  The dosage kept increasing over the years as it was less effective, until I was on 80mg for the last five years.   I had to come off it as it gave me tinnitus and then  hyperacusis (severe).  I tried other medications which made this much louder...  and it has remained even though it has been 2 years off all drugs.
Coming off the prozac was so traumatic, my anxiety was so extreme I had a complete nervous breakdown, was paranoid and my ocd became extreme.   I now have permanent hyperacusis, tinnitus, anxiety, severe OCD.  I cannot leave the house and live in hell.   I cannot hear any music AT ALL as it gets stuck in a loop.  prozac has absolutely ruined my life"
