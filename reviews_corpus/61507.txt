"I was diagnosed with prenatal depression and was prescribed this awful drug. I took ONE 2.5mg dose as directed. The next 8 hours were a blur. I can only describe it as being really drunk.  My heart rate dropped from it&#039;s usual 89bpm to 60bmp and my breathing became so slow and irregular.  I was in bed and could not move a muscle and was terrified I was going to stop breathing. Eventually I had to use the washroom and when I got up I collapsed. Will never ever take again."
