"Prozac has taken my body aches away,  Prevents me from obsessing over what someone else did or said.  Helps with anxiety, depression, stress, and crying.  A lot of the other medications I had an allergic reaction to, or they made me lethargic and gain weight. Problems with short term memory and retaining new information, but that could be my age of 60."
