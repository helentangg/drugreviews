"I&#039;ve been taking Effexor for about 20 months and it&#039;s my MIRACLE! I&#039;m 34 and began taking an medicines since I was 18. I tried Paxil, Zoloft, Buspar, Wellbutrin and finally Effexor. I am so genuinely happy and jubilant I just can&#039;t believe it. I&#039;m sure part of it is maturity, life experience and such but WOW. I plan to continue taking it forever as my anxiety is not situational as in some cases. I have a chemical imbalance that will require a medicine forever so this is the one! I&#039;ve never bee happier!"
