"After reaching a plateau on Prozac, my doctor switched me to Paxil.  My dosage was increased several times, but I felt great while I was on it.  After about 18 months, I decided to quit taking it.  The effects of trying to quit this drug on your own are horrible:  extreme nausea and dizziness, headaches, inability to eat, all of which rapidly increased.  After 2 weeks, I had to resume taking it.  After speaking with at least three different doctors and many pharmacists, they advised me it would take at least a month to wean off the Paxil and onto a new anti-depressant.  It was a rough transition, but I am so glad to no longer be taking this medication.  I wish I had never started in the first place and hated feeling addicted to it."
