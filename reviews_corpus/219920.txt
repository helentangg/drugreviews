"I have had Chronic Pain for over 13 years, as a result of a head-on MVA (other driver was impaired) 33 years ago.  The impact caused several injuries, but my broken knee and Fibula, were the worst.  I had several surgeries, that kept me pain free and active until a TKR was required.  Due to my age, it was put off, &amp; though the surgery went well, it was put off to long and triggered Chronic Pain.
I take Morphine 60 mg. x3/daily, which helps me function.  Recently, the doctor put me on Amytriptyline 25mg  x3/nightly.  I have cut back to one, as it is very difficult for me to wake up in the morning, no matter how early I take it the night before.  It does help with the pain though, and I do sleep much better!"
