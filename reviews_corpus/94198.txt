"I have been taking this med for about a month, and absolutely love it!  It has been the best thing that has happen to me in a long time.  Before Brintellix I was extremely moody, angry, impatient.  Since Brintellix I feel like  my  whole life has changed. I have been better dealing with my husband and children.  My husband  and I had a horrible relationship before... Arguing all the time.  Honestly, we haven&#039;t had one argument since I&#039;ve been taking  this med.  For me, it makes me less irritable.  The only not so great thing about this med is that it keeps me up at night.  I have a HARD time sleeping all night.   Besides that, its absolutely great!!"
