"This by far is the best anti-depressant I&#039;ve been on.  If you&#039;re looking for a medication that does NOT cause drowsiness or weight gain, this is for you.  Normally they say it takes time to feel effects, but I felt alertness and motivation right away.  I had more energy and a clearer mind, better concentration. The recommended dose is to incrementally increase 10mg-40mg, but I stayed at 20mg - too much caused RLS and mild insomnia.  I too struggle with SAD and this medication has really helped me get through the winter blues.  Lost 10 lbs on this medication as I felt less hungry.  Remember: there are so many natural ways to help with depression as well and I recommend that you explore these too.  Good luck!"
