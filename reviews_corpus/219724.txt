"Started taking 20mg before bed. I have fibromyalgia.  I also take 150mg of lyrica a day to make it threw an 8 hour shift. Without lyrica I wouldn&#039;t be able to work at all.  
I would wake up with my hair being a total mess like I was sleeping restless. My doctor said to start this at 20mg before bed and if that dose doesn&#039;t help increase by 10mg until I get to a level that works.
First couple nights have been wonderful. But I have been waking up at 6am both days and can&#039;t go back to sleep. I feel rested and alot less morning pain. Doctor is hoping I can go off lyrica.  Lyrica is causing me to feel high.  I get 8-9 hours relief with lyrica and then my pain comes back. 
I have gained about 10lbs while on lyrica but at least I can work."
