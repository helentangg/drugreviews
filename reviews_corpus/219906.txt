"Only been on it a week, but a miracle so far!
I&#039;ve suffered from IC for years had all the tests etc, a urologist recommended this to me 5 yrs. ago... I refused on the basis that it was an anti depressant, modified my diet  and went into remission with only the odd flare.
6 months ago, I had another baby and a second C Section, this resulted in a 5 month long &#039;twinge period&#039; with 4 excruciating flare ups. I was in the midst of a agonising flare up when I gave in and took 10mg of Amitriptyline! Next day still had twinges but no pain. The 2nd no twinges, no pain, just some urgency. 3rd feeling totally normal!! It&#039;s brilliant!! Still feeling normal after a whole week!! 
No side effects as yet, but not helping me sleep like I thought it would!"
