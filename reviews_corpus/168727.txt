"I have been on numerous anti-depressants for 12 years, including combinations of Zoloft and Wellbutrin, Cymbalta, Lexapro, Prozac and many others.  I also suffer from severe anxiety and have panic attacks.  I used to HAVE to take at least 2 anti-depressants to keep my depression at bay and it seemed they would only work for about 18-24 months before the combination stopped working.  I began Viibryd right after it came on the market because I needed my sex life back.   Both my Psychiatrist and I were skeptical, but I have been on 20 mg Viibryd for 3 years now and have never felt better, happier or more optimistic.  I can have orgasms now, too! it has changed my life."
