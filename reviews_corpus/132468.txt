"I have had insomnia since I was a teen, and I am turning 50 next mo. 

My doctors had tried me on natural aids, and almost every sleeping pill in the book. The sleeping pills would put me to sleep but I could not stay asleep.....most nights I would get up about 1:00am for a bathroom trip and would be up for a few hrs. Some nights I would get up to go to the restroom and stay up for the rest of the night. 

Then, my doctor prescribed doxepin. Thank goodness!  I go to sleep, and even if I get up to go to the restroom during the night, I am able to go back to bed and SLEEP! I use the liquid and take 10mgs each night and don&#039;t have any hangover the next day. The scrip costs me less than $5 for a 90-day supply. My ins co would not cover Silenor."
