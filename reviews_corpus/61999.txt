"I used celexa to treat my severe stress triggered anxiety and panic attacks. It was limiting my life to the point I thought I&#039;d have to quit my job. I&#039;d never been on anti anxiety drugs but started on 10mg which is very low. Did not see effects immediately.  Things started feeling &#039;different&#039; before they felt better.  My personal side effects were fatigue, restless tossing and turning at night (normally I&#039;m out like a log), night sweats, and weirdly sweaty hands. All of this was WAY better than having anxiety though so I&#039;m not complaining!  It relieved some anxiety but didn&#039;t really pick up my mood. I&#039;m sensitive to medication and underweight so this might be a unusual experience. I&#039;m switching to Paxil to see if I get better results."
