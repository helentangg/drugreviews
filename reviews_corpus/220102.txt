"After reading some of the reviews I just want to say that amitriptyline is not prescribed to help with the daily pain of fibromyalgia. It is used to help ease the other symptoms it can cause. If you are taking it in hopes that your daily aches and pains are going to go away then I suggest you see a different doctor and try something else. I take Savella also and that has helped me a great deal. But I am using amitriptyline because I suffer from tension headaches and migraines. Out of the month, I can go every day with a headache. I have not been on it long enough to give you a full review but since I have been on it I can say that I am sleeping much better and my headaches are getting better. I have been on it for a little more than a week."
