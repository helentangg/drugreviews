"I was on Lexapro 20mg while I was caregiver for my Mom and Brother for 10 years. They both passed away and I decided to go off of the Lexapro so weaned off.. WRONG thing to do! I hit a low and was so depressed I became suicidal. I missed them both terribly and felt so empty. MY Doctor put me on Citalopram 10 mg and within a few days I could feel the difference again. I have been on it for over a month and am on 20 mg. Finally I am able to go out and meet people again and handle my depression. The only bad thing from both meds is my lack of sexual desire. I am 67 but am not dead so would like to be able to make love with my hubby. But if that has to be given up to keep my sanity and our home peaceful again then it is worth it to both of us."
