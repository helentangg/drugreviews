"I am back again.  I always revert back to zoloft.  Beside Paxil and Buspar, those are the only REAL meds with anti anxiety properties to them that are NOT benzo and addictive.  The other anti depress can work but I really need it for anxiety 100% not depression.  I had reported that I got headaches and body aches due to jaw clenching and grinding teeth and scrunching up my body at night but I will take that over the other side effects from other meds.  If i stay at 100 mg and not go up to 150 mg then sex is not affected.  Never gain weight from this med.  I will give it a try again and deal with headaches!  This one truly does work for SAD, GADS, anxiety etc...  Oh its way cheaper than the other newer ones I was trying."
