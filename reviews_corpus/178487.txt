"I took this medication for approximately two years. For depression, it is the best I have tried. Side effects: I was always hot and seemed to sweat more in tense situations. To come off it I had to bump down to the 30&#039;s once a day, then every other day, then every third day and so on for about two months. Finally weaned off completely and feel great."
