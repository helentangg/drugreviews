"I am a female, 29 years old and have never battled depression until my dad passed away. My crying and irritablity just getting worse as months went on. I have been on Lexapro for only 2 days but I have noticed a difference in my mood. The very first day I felt a &quot;high&quot;, &quot;weird&quot; sense. It made me sleepy but then restless in the middle of the night BUT I have been already feeling better mood-wise. I am going to try and tough it out because I have more good than bad. We&#039;ll see!"
