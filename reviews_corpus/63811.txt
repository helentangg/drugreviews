"I&rsquo;ve suffered from serious depression since I was about 11 but always refused treatment because I&rsquo;m against any kind drugs and I was afraid I would lose myself and become a zombie instead and I didn&rsquo;t want that. 
 But now in my 30&rsquo;s now and feeling very suicidal, waking up anxious everyday, heart racing non stop, always crying and not being able to do anything really without being panicky and ridiculously self conscious, relationship failing because of my head, I was at the end. Started on 25mg of zoloft and from first day no crying. No depression or anxiety, no reactive emotions anymore. From first day. Didn&rsquo;t think it would work from first day but it has and I&rsquo;m blown away I didn&rsquo;t start this sooner. Side effect( very tired though ) definitely worth it."
