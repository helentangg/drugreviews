"I&#039;ve had fibromyalgia since I was 14 years old. It was not diagnosed until I was 20 at that time I took 3600 milligrams of ibuprofen a day and 40 mg of prozac. After many years I finally went to a rheumatologist who had me on elavil 40 mg. I take that and my 40 mg or prozac and have no fibromyalgia pain any more. I do however have the side effects of fibro fog, short term memory loss. It&#039;s very scary I want to stop all medicine but am afraid. The elavil acts like a prophylactic to complicated migraines for me as well as helping me sleep. Any advice from anyone. I&#039;ve been on medicine for 30 years now.
