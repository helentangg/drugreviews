"I just started this medication about 5 days ago so far I haven&#039;t had any side effects and am going to continue taking as directed I&#039;m on 20mg a day. I have been having severe anxiety due to the loss of a loved one (my brother ) hopefully this medication will work im keeping my fingers crossed will give another comment maybe 2 months into it"
