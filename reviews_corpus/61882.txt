"I have been on Celexa for about two months now and the first two days I had insomnia really bad, but then it got better as time went on. My depression is somewhat balanced, but I do have continued anxiety and stress. 
I went to my Doctor&#039;s today and had my weight checked and in less than a month I have gained 12 lbs; I was shocked! I was told it could be from the Celexa, so now I&#039;m slowly weaning myself off of that as I try my new medication; Wellbutrin. All in all, Celexa is good, and if it weren&#039;t for the weight gain I would have stayed on it. Everybody&#039;s body is different and it just wasn&#039;t the right medication for me."
