"I was diagnosed with interstitial cystitis several months ago.  The pain was so debilitating that I couldn&#039;t even see patients for about 3 days (I&#039;m a dentist).  The pain brought me to tears.  I was afraid that I would have to go on disibility.  My new urologist put me on amytripyline a few weeks ago.  It worked almost immediately. Most days I&#039;m almost pain-free.  I got my life back."
