"For me, Prozac was unfortunately not so much of a success. I didn&#039;t feel worse but I didn&#039;t feel great either. I started taking it in Oct 2016 with a dose of 10 mg, then upped to 20mg and eventually to 40 mg. So really I changed doses 3 times in 3 months. (Which is probably not the best since you don&#039;t get to get use to the drug.) but anyways I wasn&#039;t feeling any better. Still felt down and very depressed. My psychiatrist has officially switched me to Venlafaxine (which I&#039;m afraid of, since the reviews of that drugs aren&#039;t all positives). I have to say,  while on the Prozac,  sometimes I felt good but the majority of the time, I felt very depressed (not because of the drug). My side effects were fatigue and diarrhea."
