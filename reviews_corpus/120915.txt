"I suffer from severe anxiety &amp; mild depression. I had no idea how this was ruining my life. I was so nervous to try medication but finally got the point that I was desperate. Tried Zoloft, Wellbutrin &amp; Celexia. Felt awful or had such strong side effects that I couldn&#039;t continue them. Finally tried effexor at 37.5mg for 2 weeks. Those 2 weeks were absolute hell. So sick &amp; emotions were all over the place. I was about to give up on it but my doctor suggested 75mg. Wow! What a difference. Still have the side effects (nausea, constipation, some dizziness, loss of appetite, brain fog) but hoping those go away as I&#039;m only on week 3 now at new dosage. Mentally I&#039;m already feeling better! Not sure how much for my anxiety but definitely for depression"
