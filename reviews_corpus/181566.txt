"I&#039;ve been taking Prozac for about 4 years. I took 10mg, then 20mg as of last year. It worked very well for a very long time, and I felt great for years, but I&#039;m finally starting to feel a tolerance to it&#039;s effect, and it might be time to switch medications, but it&#039;s certainly been a good run. It helped me feel better, and lifted my depression."
