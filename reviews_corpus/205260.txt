"After five antidepressants this is the one that brought me back to myself. I&#039;m not 100%, but I was at 40% and now 80% myself. I am able to laugh again, appreciate the beauty of the out doors, and to enjoy my kids without yelling due to being constantly overwhelmed. My insurance switched me to generic pristiq and within a month I started feeling the anxiety and depression return. I was back to feeling like a zombie and in addition had withdraw symptoms from stopping the name brand pristiq including headaches, fatigue, muscle aches, and insomnia. I have switched back to name brand 4 days ago and feel a tiny bit better, but praying name brand pristiq kicks back in quicker. No generic!"
