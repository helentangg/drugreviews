"Had migraines since I was 6. The past 1.5 year&#039;s I&#039;ve had migraine every single day. I&#039;m now 33 years old and have this medicine since February this year. The first 3 months I had 25 mg, now 10mg. Headaches were completely gone. Since I have the lower dosage, it&#039;s coming back a bit so I will go back to 20 -25mg. This is the first medicine that&#039;s actually working so I am very happy with it !"
