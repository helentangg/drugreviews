"I&#039;ve been taking 10mg of Celexa a day for almost 3 weeks now. The first week i experienced minor side effects, excessive yawning, irregular heartbeat, anxiety and so on. I came around to the medication about 5 days into it and was feeling good, i wasn&#039;t anxious about socialising and i wasn&#039;t having as many negative thoughts (this lasted a week). But now I&#039;m feeling as though I&#039;m returning to my old self. This might be to early to call as I&#039;ve only taken 18 days worth of tablets but I&#039;m beginning to think my body has built a tolerance for it already. I&#039;m due an appointment with the doc next week so i will enquire about possibly upping the dosage and will review again once i have. I&#039;ve never taken antidepressants so trial and error i suppose!"
