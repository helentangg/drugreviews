"I&#039;ve been on lexapro for almost a week... I&#039;ve been through hell within these past few months with trying to get help. Finally got in with a new dr. &amp; My dr. prescribed me lexapro &amp; adderal. The lexapro I take at night, because it makes me tired. It has eased up my depression. However I have an upset stomach all the time now. But my anxiety is bad again. Uncontrollable crying episodes are back. Not sure if it&#039;s the adderal making me anxious... but it&#039;s hell. My clozapine isn&#039;t even working anymore like it was. That medication made me feel normal. Now it&#039;s not working. I was told lexapro would help my anxiety, &amp; it hasn&#039;t."
