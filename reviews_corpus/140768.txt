"I suffered from depression and extreme mood swings since I was 13. After 6 years, I could not take it anymore. I went to a doctor and he prescribed me Cipralex 10mg. Nothing changed for 3 weeks... I was impatient, so I upped my dose to 20mg. And it worked, completely eliminating all my mood swings and depression. I reduced my dose to 10 mg, the medication still worked. I then tapered to 0.5mg and after 18 months, stopped. It&#039;s 8 months later and overall, my mood swings and depression are still at bay. It&#039;s great medication and personally experienced no side effects, although it was slightly rougher when i tapered off completely. Just stick through it, and it will pass. My recommendation is to be patient for the medication to start working."
