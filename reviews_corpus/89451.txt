"I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety at a very young age, I believe I wasn&#039;t at the age of 10 yet. Anyways I started taking a medicine for about 6 years and it stopped working so we switched to Celexa. I now have night sweats, a dry mouth, bad drainage, and a swollen uvula. These symptoms haven&#039;t stopped and it&#039;s been several months, we think I have a virus but I believe it might be the Celexa. I&#039;m 13 years old and I&#039;m taking 20mg because they keep increasing my dose. But overall I haven&#039;t noticed any changes from any of the other medications I&#039;ve taken. "
