"I have just started taking escitalopram, 3 weeks ago after having had a terrible panic attack and been rushed to hospital. I feel still very anxious and jittery and not myself, I haven&#039;t been out of the house much and when I do I get very edgy and want back. I am turning 50 and I don&#039;t know if this all relates to menopause. I am going to have blood test and find out as I hate being like this. I have lost my confidence in going out. I feel these are making me worse. "
