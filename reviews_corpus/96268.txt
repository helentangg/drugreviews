"I was originally prescribed Zoloft for depression, but in 6 months I had a severe manic episode and was diagnosed Bipolar 1.   Now I take Zoloft with other medicines. I would not recommend taking it alone if you may be Bipolar.   I like that I have very few side effects and it does help with anxiety and compulsive behavior too.  One problem is no sexual desire, I feel like I am neglecting my boyfriend."
