"My wife unexpectedly told me she wanted a divorce and I was devastated.  We have two small boys.  I instantly saw a psychiatrist who prescribed me 50 mg of Pristiq.  It seemed to help somewhat but I would still breakdown into hysterical crying fits.  After 15 days she put me on 100 mg and I&#039;ve been fine ever since.  I feel like I can deal with this now.  I have not had any negative side effects, except shaking my leg.  I do have insomnia but I had that from the anxiety of the divorce and I&#039;m prescribed something to help me sleep.  I can&#039;t say for sure if the Pristiq causes the insomnia, but I do feel a little amped.  Overall, it&#039;s better than I thought as I generally don&#039;t feel like I&#039;m on something and feel like myself."
