"Effexor gave me my life back. I was so with anxiety for months to the point I would not come out of my room all I was doing was crying I thought I was having a break down. I&#039;m taking 75mg at night at first I felt sick and dizzy but after about 4 weeks I started to feel better. I&#039;ve been taking them now for 8 weeks and I feel back to normal. I&#039;m back in work full time I still get the odd bad day but that&#039;s to be expected. Don&#039;t know what I would have done without this medicine. Please be patient with this medication I know it&#039;s hard but after 4-6 weeks you will feel better. Good luck with it all I know it&#039;s really hard but you will get better."
