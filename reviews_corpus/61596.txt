"I began taking citalopram less than a year ago. Best decision I ever made! I remember that being the best time of my life. I made a lot of new friends/stopped pushing old friends away, had one of the best relationships I ever had, and started new hobbies that I was waaaay too scared to do before. The side effects were not too bad at all (not as bad as the depression/anxiety i felt before). The only problem was I did not take them like I should have. IF ITS WORKING NOT NOT GO OFF OF THEM. I felt genuinely happy and excited about life, that I decided I was &quot;better&quot; and didn&#039;t need the medication anymore. Bad choice, monthes later I was back to where I was before. I&#039;m here now and regret stop taking them. Seeing my doctor tomorrow. xx"
