"i was skeptical. Other meds had not worked for pain.  The pain from spinal stenosis and other arthritis and nerve pain was decreased the day after I started taking it.  The effectiveness diminished after a month so the dose was increased and it is working well . I have decreased other pain meds, can walk better and am able to do much more"
