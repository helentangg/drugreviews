"I&#039;m not sure if it is too early too speak but I&#039;m 18 years old and have had crippling depression for 2 years now and have been suffering from Generalized Anxiety Disorder since I was 8 years old. A year and a half ago my GAD decided to plague my relationship with my wonderful boyfriend of two and a half years. It&#039;s a pretty rare condition but I have self-diagnosed myself with ROCD (relationship obsessive compulsive disorder)

I have now been on Effexor for 2 months now. My G.P put me on it after crippling depression. It began working right away and I am now a much happier person. Although my anxiety is not gone, I am able to have a healthy relationship with my boyfriend. This is a miracle."
