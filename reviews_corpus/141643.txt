"I was experiencing some awful symptoms such as chest pains, shortness of breath, and heart palpitations.  Even though countless tests showed I was in great physical condition, I found it very hard to believe that such things could simply be caused by anxiety.  I guess I&#039;m a believer now!  I am on 10 mg Lexapro and the difference 2 months on this medicine has made is fantastic.  When I once feared I would be crippled by these anxiety symptoms, now I can barely even remember them.  I&#039;m feeling like &quot;me&quot; again.  Side effects included digestive problems (went away after a week or so) and insomnia (countered by taking Lexapro in the morning).  SO RELIEVED!"
