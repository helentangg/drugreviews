"I was recently diagnosed with a pinched nerve in the mid-upper back due to scoliosis (at age 66).  I have suffered pain in both the mid to upper back as well as my lower back.  A friend who recently broke her back told me I needed to ask my doctor about Elavil.  I was very familiar with this drug as I took it 40 years ago for panic attacks.  I was on 10 mg for 2 weeks and have now been on 25 mg for 2 weeks.  My upper back pain is virtually gone and if I do have break through pain, I can usually control it with Chinese Herbal Warming gel, Biofreez and DMSO.  I am sold on this medication!  Not 100% pain free yet but am at last 95% pain free."
