"I&#039;ve been on Effexor for anxiety for about 15 years.  It changed my life.  I tried Wellbutrin first but it made me even more anxiety ridden.  For a brief time I felt like the Effexor was not working as well so I switched to Pristiq.  Pristiq increased my anxiety so after about 6 months I switched back.  Within 3 days I felt almost completely better."
