"The side effects are NOT WORTH dealing with! I&#039;ve tried this medication twice and while it was the only drug I tried that helped my depression/anxiety, the side effects were killing me. I would feel sick for 3 hours  after every dose, whether I would eat with it or not. It made me constantly hungry during the day. It caused me to be so exhausted and even angry. I finally weened off of this medicine after gaining almost 100 lbs in 5 years (3 years on, 1 year off, 1 year on, now off). I only went back on because I thought the weight gain was my fault and after losing so much of it, swore I&#039;d never gain it back. Back on Effexor, back came the weight. I feel so much better off this medicine now and wouldn&#039;t recommend this drug to my worst enemy"
