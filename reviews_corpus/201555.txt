"I have anxiety and depression. I was really against taking medication so I tried to resolve my issues myself. Needless to say, it never worked. I had been going through periods of depersonalization, feeling extremely down, suicidal and hopeless. I really thought life wasn&#039;t worth living anymore. It got so bad that I ended up in the hospital. I started taking 50 mg Zoloft and honestly it has been a life changer. I don&#039;t experience depersonalization anymore. My mood has been lifted so much that I don&#039;t feel down anymore, suicidal or hopeless. If you&#039;re afraid to take medicines please just give it a try. You won&#039;t regret it. Celexa didn&#039;t work for me, but I was determined to find a medicine that would. The key is to be patient."
