"I started taking this after Celexa stopped working for me (from Celexa to Lexapro). I noticed the results immediately. SSRIs work incredibly fast for me, within hours. I have no sexual dysfunction like with some other SSRIs. I started from 10mg to balance the 20mg of Celexa since they are the same. I then went to 20mg of Lexapro. I have been spaced out since. I think that I get more frequent depersonalization. It does help with my anxiety levels most of the time. However, it doesn&#039;t really effect my OCD. I just got put on 30 mg, which I started today and am skeptical about it. I don&#039;t want to feel like a zombie all day, or wake up everyday with horrible depersonalization. Overall it is okay for reducing anxiety."
