"I&#039;ve had undiagnosed off and on depression for most of my life, until a couple years ago, my depression started acting up really badly, so I went to my (former) doctor and he prescribed me 50mg of Zoloft and over time raised my dosage to 200mg, and it just made me hyper and shaky though it helped a little bit, since he wouldn&#039;t prescribe anything else. I found my new doctor, he prescribed me Prozac first, that just suppressed my moods, then we decided Paxil or paroxetine would be a good idea. At first it gave me a weird sedated/ strung out feeling but after the first week it made me feel alive for the first time in years, and got rid of my anxiety. But ask your doctor before getting off this medicine, or even changing doses."
