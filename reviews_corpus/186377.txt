"I am a 67 year old female and I have suffered from fibromyalgia for approximately 35 years.  With that being said I have also suffered from depression over the years and have taken Prozac and Zoloft with no effect. For the past 3 months I have been suffering from anxiety and depression and have been extremely nauseated and have lost 16 pounds.  I was on venlafaxine for 2-1/2 weeks with no results and have now been on Pristiq for 9 days and instantly felt 100% better.  I have my appetite back and have much more energy.  I actually feel like living again.  I hope my health continues to be better on the medication."
