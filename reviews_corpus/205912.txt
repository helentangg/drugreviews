"I&#039;ve been taking Pristiq for almost a year.  I feel the best I&#039;ve ever felt.  I have had a huge spike in cholesterol and am on medicine now to control.  It is a recognized side effect. If I miss one day, I&#039;m really messed up emotionally and physically.  My head feels funny and I have uncontrollable sadness and anxiety.  Once I take the medicine at my next dose all those feelings go away.  If I ever need or decide to go off this medicine I will make sure to take it extremely slow."
