"After being depressed for a long time, I decided to approach my Doctor after therapy alone was not working.  I was suffering severe mood swings, crying every day, anxiety attacks and so on. I am now on day 6 of 50mg of Pristiq and its amazing.  Feel calm, in control, have not cried once and feel really good.  Side effects have been nausea, insomnia (hope this will settle down) and decreased appetite. I was putting my family through hell and it feels like I have finally turned a corner."
