"My doctor put me on 37.5 mg regular (generic brand) for about 2 weeks and I was so tired and still depressed. So she upped my dosage to 75 mg XR. And after 2 days my anxiety was out of control and depressed so I had be watched 24/7. So I finally got off it after I switched backed to 37.5 before going cold turkey. I didn&#039;t  have any withdrawal symptoms. Good luck to anyone on this medication."
