"It worked on the fibromyalgia pain, but it caused my brain to malfunction.  I couldn&#039;t think, I became forgetful, I got &#039;lost and confused&#039; in my own house, my head felt as if it was full of cobwebs and I was walking in a fog all the time, I&#039;d wake up as tired as I had been when I went to bed unless I drank a few beers or had a couple of glasses of wine. I am now in pain AND depressed. Trying to locate a natural [herb/spice] for fibromyalgia pain and subsequent depression."
