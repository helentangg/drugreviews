"I have been taking Effexor XR for several years, alternating between 37.5 mg and 75 mg when needed.  I feel better, but it still does not keep me from having attacks.  I have to take an Ativan when I have an attack to get it to stop.  I have been dealing with this for about 12 years and Effexor XR is the most effective out of Celexa and Zoloft."
