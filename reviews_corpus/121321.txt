"I was having bad anxiety for a couple of months.  I was unable to sleep, and was pacing the floors a lot. I got on a low dose of Effexor (37.5mg), and my anxiety disappeared within a week.  I did not have many side affects.  I got a little sweaty the first week, and felt a little foggy.   That went away quickly."
