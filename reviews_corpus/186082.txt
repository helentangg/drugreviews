"I have been depressed for coming up to 5 years. Pristiq is the first medication I found that worked. I started on 50mg and then started 100mg. I found that I was able to get through the days without falling apart and having constant suicidal thoughts. I have been on pristiq for a few years now and I have always had very vivid dreams on them and if I miss a couple of pills I get very dizzy, nauseas, head aches and get very emotional. I love this antidepressant but I fear for my dependence on it"
