"I just started taking a generic Zoloft a few days ago for my Border line personality disorder/ anxiety . The first day, I felt very sluggish, like a zombie. I feel sick, and I got plenty of sleep last night, however, I do not know how I&#039;m going to be able to go to work today. I feel like I have no motivation, and it gives me such a bad sick feeling, that I can&#039;t stick through. I&#039;m trying though, but if the sickness, sluggish, numbing of the mind thing doesn&#039;t go away, I&#039;m going to discontinue taking this medicine. I feel like I can&#039;t think what so ever because Zoloft is numbing my mind."
