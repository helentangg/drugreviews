"I have been on citalopram a couple of times. I have to say for me it has been a blessing. The first four weeks getting this drug into my system were HELL. I have never felt so terrible in all my life but I did know once I got through the initial &lsquo;adjustment&rsquo; period I would see the rewards and that I am.  See this drug through, it is hard work but you have to weather the storm to see the rainbow"
