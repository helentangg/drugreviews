"I reluctantly started this medication a year ago after trying to deal with depression on my own.  After I began taking it I had some mild side effects (Intense dreams, Tiredness) but they subsided after about a month.  The good effects started at that point, I now feel stable, content and don&#039;t let things and people get to me like before.  It gives me the ability to make bad thoughts simply evaporate from my thought process.  I recommend this medicine to anyone who feels the destructive effects of depression like I did, but give it time to work, stick with it and it will change your life.  "
