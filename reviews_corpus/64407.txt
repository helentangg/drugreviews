"It took a few weeks, but I feel so much better. I felt like I was stuck on the bottom of a seesaw and couldn&#039;t balance out my mood.  I couldn&#039;t handle my rage over the smallest things. I would wake up and couldn&#039;t shut off my brain. Now I&#039;m sleeping better, I wake up in a normal mood and no longer &quot;sweat the small stuff.&quot; In addition, I am getting along much better with my family and friends. Let&#039;s just say I am better to be around.  Don&#039;t worry about the side effects. I stayed away from Zoloft for a long time because I had anxiety about the side effects. Guess what? No side effects! Just a better life."
