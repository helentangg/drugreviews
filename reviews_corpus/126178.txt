"Great medicine, anxiety is basically gone. No panic attacks for over six months. The diarrhea is only for a couple of weeks then its gone. Be weary though, once you are on a regular dosage, be SURE to take your pill at the EXACT same time you do every day!!! I prefer to take mine an hour or two before I go to bed. If you do not or are a day or two without it be ready for the most horrific, disturbing, vivd, real, terrifying nightmares you will ever have!!! Seriously, I&#039;ve literally felt like there is someone in the room and that they were physically touching me. I cannot explain to you how real these dreams are. Besides that this medication is perfect. Just take it on time and have your refills ready and you have nothing to worry about."
