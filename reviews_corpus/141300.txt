"Suffered from mild anxiety and mild depression as well as moderate PMDD. This medicine at 5mg has literally transformed my life. I was worried about weight gain as I had an eating disorder before, but I haven&#039;t gained a pound or lost a pound.  I am the person I used to be, I don&#039;t yell and scream from PMDD anymore.  The first week I had headaches, and vivid dreams but that goes away, now the only side effect I have is very entertaining detailed dreams; its neat actually."
