"I&#039;ve been on Prozac now for a totally of four months - ish. I felt nothing for about two months, and then one day I woke up... and I felt like a different person.  I cleaned my bedroom, got rid of half my things, did all the work that I was supposed to do, and I felt amazing.  

I still feel like a new person.  Now, there is more balance.  I feel normal.  For the first time ever.  The first two months were tough, I was tired, but couldn&#039;t sleep at night.  Now I&#039;m on an entirely normal sleep schedule, more normal than ever.  I was having some heart palpitations, but that went away. I do have rather vivid dreams still, and I&#039;ve lost weight, but I think that&#039;s just me feeling better about myself."
