"Lexapro has been the only antidepressant I&#039;ve taken that has alleviated my depression at all. It worked well for me and it started working within 2 days! I could laugh again and my anxiety went down. I took 20 mg daily. Unfortunately, within 6 months I gained 25 lbs! That was the only drawback and I had to stop taking it bc of the weight gain. The first couple times I took it, everything looked fuzzy and psychedelic but that went away quickly. I&#039;d say it&#039;s definitely worth a try if you&#039;re depressed or anxious."
