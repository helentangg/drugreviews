"Paxil has changed my life!

Before: paranoia about people watching me, extreme anxiety walking or being in public places, such as cafeterias, college campus, small groups of people. Mind blankness during conversations, or &quot;social lock up&quot; - inability to interact with others due to severe anxiety. Always woke up feeling tired even if I had a full nights sleep. 

Side Effects (lasted 2 weeks): 20mg daily. Severe fatigue/sleepiness. A little dizziness if dose was taken late. Headache the 1st two days.

Now: Began working really well 7-8 weeks in. No more social anxiety, I feel normal walking around &amp; talking to people. Also I sleep better than ever. Overall anxiety level has gone down &amp; I no longer ruminate/worry constantly! Paxil rocks!"
