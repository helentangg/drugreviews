"My doctor prescribed 25 mg nightly before bed to help prevent migraines. I&#039;ve been taking it for about 2 months and I&#039;ve gone from 6 separate migraine attacks in a 2 week span to 4 in a two month span. I may need to up the dosage soon because 3 have been recently (within the last month). Anywho, helps me sleep wonderfully at night without making me groggy before or after bed. I also have no harsh side effects like thoughts of suicide or anything like that. 10/10 would recommend for migraine sufferers - I have it a 9 because I think I need to up my dosage."
