"Took 50 mg in the morning as directed, the day went fine and I was productive but was awake all night.  Didn&#039;t sleep at all and felt jumpy for the first hour or so out of bed.  I&#039;ve been on Wellbutrin for years and felt like it might not be helping anymore -- well, after a scary night where I felt like I was on a bad trip -- just make it stop -- I&#039;m back to Wellbutrin.  If anyone knows a good alternative to Wellbutrin that&#039;s not Effexor or Pristiq, I&#039;d love to hear about it."
