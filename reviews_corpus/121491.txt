"I&#039;m currently on venlafaxine, 300mg/day, and have been on it for 6 months now.  This stuff works beautifully for me.  I had/have MDD, GAD, SAD, and took Paxil for 10 years, which worked quite well until 8 months ago.  I was scared of switching because of the fact that not all anti-depressants work for everyone, and I was terrified of fully reverting back to my suicidal, petrified old self.  My psychiatrist was able to convince me after a couple months to go for it.  On the venlafaxine I feel calm, HAPPY, able to concentrate, mildly euphoric, and better than I did in my early days of taking Paxil.  This stuff is hit or miss for different people, but don&#039;t be scared to try it if you haven&#039;t.  And give it time to work."
