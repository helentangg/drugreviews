"I&#039;ve suffered with depression type symptoms most of my life. I mainly suffer from Somatization disorder. 
I&#039;ve tried many different antidepressants over the past 20 years &amp; they usually only made me more depressed. 
I started 10 mg Brintellix May of 2014. I felt AMAZING! Then, it wore off &amp; was bumped to 20mg. This worked fine. 
One side effect that we can&#039;t figure out is that I&#039;m always SO HOT! Not sweating, Just always crazy hot!
I weaned off the Brintellix over two months, until I was taking just a small corner of the thinner side then stopped. That was 3 weeks ago. Since then, I had TERRIBLE withdrawals &amp; couldnt stand it. Head vibrating is the worst. 
Went back on Brintellix last night.
I feel discouraged. 
But it worked for depression...."
