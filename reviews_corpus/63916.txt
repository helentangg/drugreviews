"I didn&#039;t realize it at the time but this stuff really did literally make me bipolar! I never considered myself bipolar before this medication. It made me not be able to sleep for days at a time, made my normal moods worse at times, and just over all set off mental conditions that I don&#039;t normally have issue&#039;s with, and at the time I didn&#039;t see or understand that, now."
