"Problems are panic attacks, phobias and generalized anxiety disorder, as a result to early menopause.  First I tried Effexor 75mg, horrible blood pressure sky rocket up 170/101... Then I tried Fetzima for 5 days and couldn&#039;t tolerate high heart rate.  Resting Heart Rate 96 and while I was walking 110 to 125. Not good always felt like I was climbing a hill, otherwise no other side effects except goosebumps and feeling cold.  So then I started Cymbalta 13 days ago, the first 3-4 days very anxious, unable to sleep major.  My body was tired, but my mind was not.  Every time I would try to sleep my jaw would clench and my body would jerk (myoclonis jerks) and wake me up.  I took small dose of Ativan to help me sleep.  Also the first 4 days became hypoglycemic."
