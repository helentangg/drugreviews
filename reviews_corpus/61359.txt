"I spent a lot of my life struggling with generalized anxiety disorder. After suffering what I think was an un diagnosed breakdown my doctor changed me from Amitriptyline (very low dose) to Citalopram. Life has not got easier it is in fact the hardest it has ever been. I am divorced, out of work and struggling financially. However the Citalopram has relieved my anxiety and depression and made me happy for being alive. The only downfall is that I sometimes wonder if the lack of anxiety is the reason why I am not achieving financial freedom at the moment and that the Citalopram is causing complacency and making me too choosy,  Perhaps however it feels so good not to have a dark  heavy cloud over my head which was a constant source of mental pain"
