"This is my fourth month on Lexapro. I was having debilitating anxiety and phobias that interfered greatly with my life and my Dr said was causing me to be depressed. I never wanted to take a medicine before because I was too scared (anxiety) but I&#039;m so glad my Dr talked me into it. Other people even notice a difference in me and say I just look better. I feel so much better. I&#039;m not scared all the time and having dissociative thoughts. My fear kept me in bed because I couldn&#039;t make a decision but now I get up and do all the things I love again and I&#039;m not so tired. The first few weeks were hell with side effects but I knew those would wear off and they did. You just have to stick it out. But then again, nobody knows how anyone will react."
