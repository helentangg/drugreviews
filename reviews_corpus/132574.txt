"I&#039;ve been using doxepin for about 2 years for insomnia.  I used to wake every night after 2-3 hours of sleep and then was unable to get back to sleep for 1-2 hours.  This has helped tremendously.  I now sleep through the night, dream and feel better through the day.  If I do wake, I am able to roll over and get back to sleep quickly.  I take it just prior to bed, and get about 7 solid hours of sleep.  I experience some dry mouth in the morning, but nothing severe, and it can be a bit difficult to get going in the morning.  Overall, I&#039;m much better than before."
