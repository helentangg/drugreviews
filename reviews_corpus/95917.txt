"For most of my life I have felt something was wrong. Recently my anxiety began to feel worse than usual so I went to a new doctor. He prescribed me Sertraline. For the first week I felt anxiety and headaches, just quite &#039;wired&#039;. I was worried I was going to damage my brain and the meds wouldn&#039;t work but then suddenly I felt &#039;fixed&#039;! I am so relaxed now. I don&#039;t feel like I&#039;m going mad from anxiety anymore! This is how I should have always felt. Glad I&#039;ve sorted this out in my twenties. I wish I&#039;d been prescribed this medication sooner!"
