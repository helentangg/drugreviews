"I started to take this med one week ago for my gad. Im feeling a bit &quot;lighter&quot; in the head but i also have a bit more anxiety and i feel dizzy. I&#039;ve read that this is totally normal, and i have been an benzo addict so i had EXTREME anxiety when i was in rehab getting off that stuff. Now my life is looking brighter, and I have a lot of faith in this med. Just went from 37mg to 75mg once a day. I&#039;m looking forward to share my experience here in one month :)"
