"I&#039;ve been on this medication for a little over two years and it&#039;s been great. It has had very few side effects for me, as opposed to Prozac (fluoxetine). Unfortunately, however, it&#039;s been losing its effectiveness as my body grows more and more immune to it, and if I miss taking a dose for one day, I have withdrawals, which is why I give this medication an 8."
