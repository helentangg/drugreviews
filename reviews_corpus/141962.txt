"I wasn&#039;t severely depressed but I was always CRAZY sensitive, flipped out and cried at the smallest things, had pretty bad anxiety for no reason and would think negative thoughts over and over until I couldn&#039;t sit with myself.

I finally decided to see a psychologist who recommended I have a psychiatric evaluation- in which they prescribed Lexapro. They started me on 10mg for two weeks and bumped me up to 20mg, which I have been taking for the last 2 months.

I can&#039;t even express the immense change I experienced. I have never felt so content in my life. It never changed my personality in a drastic way, but I feel very confident, I can brush things off easily, I don&#039;t feel stuck in life, I can actually have fun. I LOVE this medicine."
