"I was given this by my doctor. I took one pill at night and had the most horrible side effects. I thought I had the flu. My whole body hurt all over. I had fluttering in my chest. I had a headache and heartburn,  nausea, could not eat. Was so tired could not do a thing for 2 days these side effects went on. Did not take anymore than the one pill and said that was it for me. This is horrible feelings in the world the meds are not for me and I was on the lowest dose 37.5 so I was told. I still have a hangover from this one pill after 3 days off of it."
