"Psychotropic medications are appropriate for the small percentage of us who would literally die by our own hands if we didn&#039;t take them. For that reason, their relative levels of effectiveness are often viewed by us through a completely different lens (realistically) than by those who take them for less serious reasons. Even bouts of major depression don&#039;t constitute a definite reason for taking pharmaceuticals. If it keeps you alive &amp; lets you to work towards having something better BEYOND just &#039;existing&#039;, it&#039;s working. Try to reevaluate the manner in which YOU are evaluating the medication&#039;s effectiveness based upon what it is TRULY intended to do. As with everything in life, maintaining realistic goals &amp; expectations is key to happiness."
