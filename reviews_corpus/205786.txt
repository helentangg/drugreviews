"The increase in happiness is amazing. I had been taking Effexor and Wellbutrin for about 4 yrs. I am on day 5 of Pristiq and I really love it. Scaling down from Effexor was extremely difficult. My poor kiddies, I just kept explaining to them that I was not mad at them and it was just a change in my crazy pills, as we call them. I am still on the Wellbutrin. I would love to see a decrease in weight.  I am an emotional eater. I tend to think about food constantly. I eat by the clock and I actually forgot to eat lunch this weekend!  My hubby says this is the girl he fell in love with. "
