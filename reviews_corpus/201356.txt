"I&#039;m rating it a 5 for now because I took it 10 years ago with no problems. I started on 25mg then. This time they started me on 50 so maybe it is the dose. I took it last night and I have had one continuous panic attack. Tremors. Insomnia. Sick to my stomach. A hot sensation that comes over my body. I&#039;m a mess. Waiting on Dr to call me, so if I decide to stay on it I will leave another review. 10 years ago when I took it, it just made me emotionless but I was also going through a lot. I lost a bunch of weight with it too. However, I had 0 side effects."
