"I initially started taking Cymbalta at 60 mg but the nausea was unbelievably dreadful. I couldn&#039;t even drink a glass of water without throwing it back up. I consulted my physician and we agreed to trying the 30 mg dosage. The nausea has decreased intensely and is manageable. I highly recommend taking it with food. My mood is wonderful."
