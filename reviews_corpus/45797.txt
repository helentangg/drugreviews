"I have taken Fluoxetine for PMDD for 3 months and the results have been remarkable.  I take 20 mg daily.  I still get a bit down around my period but I am able to control myself.  I do experience some side effects.  I wake up around 3-4am and have difficulty going back to sleep, my legs are restless at night and during the first few weeks only I lost interest in personal grooming and became lethargic.  I can live with the side effects.  My quality of life has greatly improved since taking Fluoxetine."
