"I had high hopes for Zoloft, SSRI #3 that was tried. I didn&#039;t experience ANY side effects getting on it until about day 14, when I noticed my depression was getting very bad. I was getting mood swings (and I don&#039;t mean highs and lows, I mean neutrals and super lows) so my doc suggested I get off of it. I didn&#039;t notice it helping. It made me feel more emotional."
