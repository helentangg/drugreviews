"I have been experiencing major depression and suicidal thoughts. It got to the point that all I wanted to do everyday is stay in bed, not eat, check my blood pressure all day to make sure I&#039;m not having a aneurysm or stroke. I take the problems of my patients and relate them to myself so in case I get the symptoms they had before having a medical emergency. I start to panic and lose my appetite, etc. I also suffer from anxiety and panic attacks. I&#039;ve seen a psychologist, who was helpful but once I left it was hard for me to focus on the things we talked about due to my daily repetitive ritual of stressing and being depressed. I&#039;ve been on Prozac for 2 weeks 10 mg - have all the side effects but seems to be a break through. I&#039;ll see after a month."
