"I&#039;ve taken Zoloft, Wellbutrin, and citalopram. I take the generic citalopram and this has by far been the best medication and lasted the longest. I&#039;ve been on it for 5 years now and it manages my depression well.

The only downside is that SSRIs can cause hypothyroidism, so I am now also on thyroid medication. I went undiagnosed for years because the thyroid test ranges are so broad. I never had a thyroid problem before I started anti-depressants.

Still, the trade off is worth it because without the antidepressants I&#039;d be dead.

If you are on an SSRI&#039;s, get your thyroid checked.  A TSH range over 3.0 is a problem no matter what your doctor says."
