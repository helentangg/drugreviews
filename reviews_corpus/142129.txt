"I have been taking Lexapro for two years. I had been diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis and was in and out of the hospital for several months. Depression and anxiety were severe for me. I was impatient, over reacting over every little thing, nervous to be around others and would cry for no reason. I take lexapro 20mg once a day and feel great now. The side effect I had was sleepiness, but after a couple weeks it went away. I am more happy with my life now."
