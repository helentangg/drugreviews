"I was on 100mg of Pristiq which really wasn&#039;t working for me. I stopped taking medication and started having suicidal thoughts.

A friend recommended Cymbalta so I saw a Dr and started on 30mg. Within a month my depression was nearly non-existent. I had off days but overall it was amazing. 

After the month though, I noticed I was starting to feel down and irritable towards the end of the day (I take mine at night before sleep)

I&#039;ve been increased to 60 mg and I can&#039;t be happier. I have not felt this calm and happy with life in close on 7 years

There are noticeable side effects for me. I have extremely vivid dreams most nights and I can recall most of them upon waking. Also loss of appetite is a big one."
