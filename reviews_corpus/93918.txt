"I was diagnosed with major depression after years of dealing with terrible Rheumatoid arthritis that has limited my mobility. My doctor prescribed me 3 different antidepressants and after Cymbalta gave me head zaps and my anxiety was causing panic attacks he switched me to Trintellix. I started on the 5 mg while I was weaning off 60 mgs of Cymbalta. The nausea was so bad. I would like to think I have a pretty strong stomach but this med made me sick like when I was pregnant. I stuck with it and 3 weeks in at 10 mgs I feel fantastic! I&#039;m so glad I stuck with it!! I&#039;m laughing again and my motivation is incredible! It was so worth it! If you&#039;re debating it stick with it through the nausea to see if it works for you. Im truly thankful!!"
