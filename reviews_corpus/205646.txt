"I am 58, married father of 2.  I had a major crash about a month ago.  Got addicted to gambling and finally told my wife, then the crash.  I have always had some anxiety throughout my life.  Nothing like this.  Been on it for 4 days, tired and sleep is so so.  My hope is that given more time I will see more benefits.  Right now it&#039;s a struggle to see getting better and tough for my son to see his Dad suffering. Dr says 1-2 weeks to see full benefits.
