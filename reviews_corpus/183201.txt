"It works well for depression.  Even stopped nerve pain that I didn&#039;t know I had since I had lived with it all my life.  I just thought it was normal to have pins and needle feeling in my nerve endings.  Lifted the depression.  Was okay on anxiety, but still had to take Valium for true panic attacks.  Warning though - getting off this medication can give hard withdrawals. You have to slowly wean yourself off. If not, you will get brain freezes or shivers which are freaky and scary.  Also, extremely irritable coming off of it."
