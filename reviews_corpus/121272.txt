"I&#039;ve started taking Effexor XR recently at the lowest dose 37.5mg and the first day you get very nauseous even if you do eat beforehand, I felt so foggy. After a few days the side effects subsided so I upped my dosage to 75mg and the same thing happened. So I&#039;d recommend when starting this medication you also have an anti nausea medication with it otherwise you&#039;ll have a few crappy days. This medication has benefited me the most out of all the others I tried because it brought back my focus."
