"I&#039;ve had extremely bad anxiety for 25 years and I have  been very very depressed on and off through my life.   I had tried many different prescriptions in  the past but gave up on every one of them because of side effects.  

This medication has felt like it saved my life in many ways.  I went from feeling like I was in a very dark hopeless place that effected my work and social life too feeling like quality of life is so manageable and pleasant and bright. 

So much to be thankful for."
