"So far it had been a little over a month and a half on 5 mg, for my depression and constant ups and downs. I have bi polar, PTSD, anxiety, and depression. Of all the meds this has helped tremendously, with only nausea as a side effect. I eat toast and peanut butter and it seems to help. I feel like myself again, with better concentration, more energy, and I&#039;m smiling again. This honestly saved my life with the help of other meds that I am on!"
