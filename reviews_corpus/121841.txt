"Effexor Saved Me After Many Failed Medicines.  

Current Med Combo- Effexor 75 mg, Lamictal 200 mg, Abilify 5 mg

It saved me from wasting anymore time locked up in my house 24/7 and avoiding conversations, knocks at the door, people, telephone calls, and anything else involving socializing. 

I FINALLY LEAVE MY HOUSE. WILLINGLY and REGULARLY. Daily.  I NO LONGER FEAR APPLYING FOR JOBS. I NO LONGER FEAR THE POSSIBILITY OF HAVING A JOB because I would have to deal with people. I am willing and eager to go out with friends, family, acquaintances, meet new people. 

SIDE EFFECTS- Only Nightmares, which eventually become less and less and then go away after 2 months. Maybe a little unpleasant at first. Definitely bearable.

It&#039;s not bad for everyone."
