"3 weeks in and I&#039;m loving it. I&#039;ve lost 2kg and not as hungry at meal times. My side effects were: thirsty, couldn&#039;t drink enough, one night couldn&#039;t sleep for 24 hrs. Couple of nights later and I was up for 26 hrs! Everything has settled down now and I think this medicine is fantastic. I have so much MORE energy and sleeping so much better."
