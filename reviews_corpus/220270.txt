"I&#039;ve had cyclical vomiting syndrome for about a year and a half and was diagnosed about two months ago, as soon as I was diagnosed I was put on amitriptyline. The only side effect I have noticed is a bit of sleepiness, but not enough to really affect my life. Amitriptyline has given me back my quality of life and I&#039;ve started uni and am looking for part time work, this would never have been possible before being on amitriptyline."
