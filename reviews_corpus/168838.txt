"These reviews have confirmed what I&#039;ve been thinking for a few months now. I&#039;ve been waking up at 3 am like clock work, I&#039;m irritated at the smallest things, gained 20 lbs and just feel down all the time. I was on Effexor and Zoloft for years until they stopped working for me so my Dr tried me on Viibryd.  Worst move ever. I want to beat my fists against everything and everyone.  Going to see him next week and demanding to be changed to something else."
