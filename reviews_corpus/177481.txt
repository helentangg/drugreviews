"I am 48 and have been struggling to break my roller coaster ride that is a BI-polar . I self medicated with alcohol for a long time , I became disabled 100% and Sober In 2008. In the past when I was drinking ,I would never give any meds a chance and my diagnoses would change with Dr&#039;s . Christmas time 2015 , my cycles were steady ,I am a single Father of 4 kids and my kids did not deserve This .My mental Health provider had tried so many different drugs WARNING  !!!!! Be Honest with yourself and Your Health care team ,They are so much more effective if they know ALL OF YOUR STORY  . I felt like I was at the of my rope and I would never feel like me again . This Medicine worked me Me very very well . Keep fighting"
