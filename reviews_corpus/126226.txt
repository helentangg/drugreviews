"My psychiatrist gave me sample packs of Viibryd to try out. It was my first antidepressant I had been on. It worked fantastic the first 2-3 weeks. I had no side effect problems, my energy was back to normal, and most importantly, my depression and suicidal thoughts had gone away. After the 3 weeks, everything returned back to normal. I feel worse than I used to before I was on the medicine and my suicidal thought have returned. Maybe it just wasn&#039;t for me."
