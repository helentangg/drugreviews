"I just started this medication for my fibromyalgia about 3 days ago.  I&#039;m already sleeping better, getting relief from my chronic migraines AND it has helped my irritable bowel syndrome.  I know it&#039;s still too soon to tell but I really didn&#039;t expect results this soon.  Hopefully things stay on the up and up.  I have suffered from fibro for over 16 years now and have tried numerous meds."
