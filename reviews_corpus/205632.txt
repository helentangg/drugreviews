"I started taking Pristiq since I was having anxiety, slight depression and mild panic attacks in my job (I&#039;m in sales). I was taking Lexapro on and off for a couple of years, but felt it wasn&#039;t working anymore, so my doctor recommended Pristiq. I am 3 days in and feel great! I&#039;ve experienced slight nausea (but food helps), decreased appetite, dry mouth and slight jaw clenching. Also my first two days, a couple of hours after I took it (which has been in the morning), I would feel extremely tired. But I would snap out of it and feel great. Overall, I feel happy, calm and focused. I hope to only be on Pristiq for short term, but while I am going through this difficult time in life it will be my miracle. "
