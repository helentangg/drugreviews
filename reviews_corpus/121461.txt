"I began taking Effexor over a year ago and had recently reduced my dose from 225mgs to 75mgs- the side effects of reducing the doseage were awful... Light headed nests, blurred vision etc. However due to a family bereavement my doctor has increased the doseage again to 225mgs. I feel that the anxiety has alleviated but am still feeling tearful and unable to sleep. Since taking Effexor my motivation has disappeared and am gaining weight"
