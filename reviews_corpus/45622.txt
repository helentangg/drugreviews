"I am starting my 3rd week on Prozac, 20 mg daily.  I feel like a new person and am so grateful.  I agonized over this choice for weeks, but after 6 months of unbearable anxiety and sadness, then skyrocketing blood pressure, I knew I had to do something. I visited my GP - we did the physical, blood tests, etc. to rule out other factors.  It turns out empty nest   beginning menopause have done a number on me.  The medicine made me feel nauseous, sleepy, like being on cold medicine.  On the 10th day, my appetite returned! I don&#039;t notice side effects at all anymore.  The sadness - 97% gone.  The anxiety - 75% gone.  I also start visits with a therapist in 2 weeks.  Again, I&#039;m grateful to get my life back."
