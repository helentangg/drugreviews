"My wife had major mood swings.  Irritable, would stay angry for days about the smallest things.  No sex drive, tired all the time.  An hour after taking the pill, she was a different person.  Happy, more affectionate, less tired, funny, easy going.  A miracle. She said she had always felt as though she was living her life under water or in the clouds and this medicine made things clear.  It&#039;s be wonderful. Only side effect has been some bruising."
