"Horrific side effects and incredibly difficult to wean off of as well because of the withdrawal symptoms. When I first started taking it, I felt some relief but it didn&#039;t last very long. I&#039;d taken Lexapro and Zoloft in the past and felt that, over time, they were no longer helpful in treating my depression which is why my doctor put me on Effexor. It took me a while to realize this medication was worsening my depression symptoms and I didn&#039;t realize it until after a botched suicide attempt. I don&#039;t recommend this medication to ANYONE for any reason. Worst of the worst as far as I&#039;m concerned. It&#039;ll trick your brain for a little while into thinking you&#039;re improving but the depression and anxiety will come back and hit you ten times worse!"
