"I&#039;m pretty sure that I don&#039;t suit this medication. The first three weeks were absolute torture with blurred vision, headaches, nausea, and no energy. After that time the medicine did seem to help my anxiety and depression. However, after three months the side effects came back worse than the first three weeks. I went to my doctor and asked to switch medications immediately. Coming off of the Cymbalta was the worst experience of my life. At one point I had uncontrollable shaking and muscle movements. I couldn&#039;t even concentrate enough to go to the kitchen and make a sandwich. I know this drug works for many people, but for myself it was like taking poison."
