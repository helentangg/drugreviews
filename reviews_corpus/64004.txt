"Been on it reluctantly for two years at first did not work, tried others and went back to it. Originally 100mg no sex drive and extreme tiredness, cut in half deal with very very mild thoughts and occurrence of negativity, the sex drive modest and normal. So at 50mg slights on everything but able to function and think out problems instead of reacting horrible."
