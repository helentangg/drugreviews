"I suffered with migraines for years because doctors weren&#039;t able to diagnose them. They thought my headaches were related to sinus problems. I got headaches 4-5 times a week. Finally a neurologist prescribed 25mg nortriptyline daily. It took a few weeks to take effect but now I have been nearly headache free for four years. I do still occasionally get headaches every few months but they never last more than a few hours and generic Imitrex helps.  I asked the doctor about going off the nortriptyline but she said if not&#039;s broken why fix it. So I am going to stay on this wonder drug. Best of luck to anyone suffering with headaches. It&#039;s a tough time."
