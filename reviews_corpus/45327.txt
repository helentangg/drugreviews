"I was prescribed prozac for depression about 3 months ago. I began feeling normal- happy, even- about a month and a half ago. Before, I was suicidal and rarely left my bed. I was unable to do anything; maintaining basic hygiene became difficult. Starting out on prozac, I was skeptical, simply because I didn&#039;t believe that anyone or anything could help me. However, I&#039;m so glad that I waited the suggested 6 weeks! I feel great now, and don&#039;t overthink things or pressure myself unnecessarily. The only negative side effect is insomnia; I&#039;ll fall asleep fine, but wake up around 3 AM. All in all, i reccommend it."
