"Hi, this drug I feel seems to stabilise your mood/brain and does make you happy. Not like a drug , it corrects my brain to how I&#039;m meant to feel, (some people hopefully understand what I mean-rather than feeling down ,just want to be alone, quiet, low).  I think I had anxiety, mild depression &amp; insomnia. 

I feel more focused and feel my true self. I&#039;m 35, a professional, single fit and healthy. Death divorce boom. Just battled on, shattered, hiding my feelings until finally just giving this a chance. After 1 month I&#039;m on 100mg of pristiq a day and love how it&#039;s giving me my life back!"
