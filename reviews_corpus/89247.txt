"I have been on Celexa for almost 2 years &amp; has completely changed my life for the better. I take 40mg once a day. I suffer from severe anxiety, &amp; mild depression. Celexa is my happy pill. My savior. It&#039;s the best pill I have ever been on. I am anxiety &amp; depression free all from Celexa. Never once had one side effect. I am full of energy all the time and am happy beyond happy. It took about a good 2 months for the medication to start doing its job. WELL WORTH THE WAIT. I thank my doctor all the time for introducing me to the wonder drug CELEXA. Give it some time to kick in &amp; you&#039;ll thank me later. Lol good luck to all."
