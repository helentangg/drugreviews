"Anger management issues and depression had plagued me my whole life. I have been fired from many a job for the problems I would bring upon myself.  I&#039;ve been on Prozac 20mg for 10 years and it has changed my life. I was able to perform with minimal issues and my wife didn&#039;t divorce me even though she had grounds to so. WARNING! I couldn&#039;t get a renewal from my doctor because he stopped taking my insurance. So I tried to get another doctor but appointments were months away and went off my meds cold turkey. 6 weeks into the withdrawal I was fired from my job, of which I loved, because I had a meltdown. I was yelled at by another employee and I started to loose control. The bottom line was they escorted me out of the building."
