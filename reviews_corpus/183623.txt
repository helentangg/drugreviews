"I took cymbalta 50 mg everyday for over 2 months.  This was to treat a generalized anxiety disorder and minor depression.  I live in the Midwest where the sun does not come out very often in the winter months.  The medicine was effective in the long run in treating my minor depression due to the winter blues however when I first started taking the medicine I did have suicidal thoughts, which was very strange for me.  Eventually, it interfered with my libido, which caused me to stop taking the medicine. I am 22 years old and for me to begin to experience libido issues led me to discontinue this medicine.  This might be a isolated issue but I hope it helps you decide if the side effects outweigh its benefits."
