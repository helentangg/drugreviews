"I had depressive episodes even as a teenager.  They seemed to get worse every third month.  I&#039;d been on every known medicine for twenty years without any help.  I took Valium for panic attacks several times a day every day for twenty years.  I&#039;ve been on Viibryd for five weeks and finally found help.  The only side effects have been diarrhea only in the morning the first few days and dry mouth.  I wake up feeling very good each day.  Thank you."
