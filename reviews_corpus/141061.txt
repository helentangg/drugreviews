"I&#039;ve been taking this for about 2 wks now... And after 10 years of struggling with anxiety/panic attacks... I finally feel like I&#039;m getting back to my old self. I&#039;ve had minimal side effects. Currently taking 5mg and it seems to be working for me. Glad I finally found something that helps!!"
