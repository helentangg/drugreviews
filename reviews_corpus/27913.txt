"I&#039;ve been taking 10mg lexapro for anxiety for 5 days now.
Off and on in the past yr my level of anxiety has escalated so much that I thought I might have a nervous breakdown or something. I became anti social and angry. I would break down in tears if I thought about anything for more than 3 seconds. I felt hopeless and helpless.
I also take Adderall xr20MG.
My dr gave me lexapro 10mg  and said I might experience the side effects and call her in 1 wk if it was too much too handle. Headache for a couple hrs was all I experienced. I feel awesome! Like a wet blanket has been lifted off of me. I don&#039;t avoid people anymore and I feel like I can face the world and be me again. I think now that the tension is lifted I feel better physically!"
