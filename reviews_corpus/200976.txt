"I was prescribed Zoloft for postpartum depression, anxiety and OCD of contamination. I took 10mg of Zoloft for two weeks only as it was ineffective for me. I experienced no side effects, which was the only upside. All medications work differently for different people. I experienced postpartum depression and anxiety only one month after my first and only son was born. As a first time mom I thought everything I was experiencing was typical, until I began having suicidal thoughts and resorted to self harm all taking a toll on my relationship with my son and husband. Waited until my son was 10 months old to finally get help. I felt severe anxiety still while taking Zoloft. Again this is only my experience with this medication."
