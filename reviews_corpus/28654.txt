"I have had bipolar since I was 10 years old and Lexapro is the only medicine that helps me. If it wasn&#039;t for Lexapro I wouldn&#039;t have my three wonderful kids and a good man in my life. I&#039;m only 22 and out of the 12 years I&#039;ve been taking medicines Lexapro is the only one that has helped me. The other ones make me meaner then me being off my medicines."
