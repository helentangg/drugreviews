"I have been taking this now for 30 days and on the 13 day I felt dizzy and sick to my stomach. I also did not feel emotionally well for a few days after. I lost weight the first week and appetite has been suppressed somewhat. I continue to lose a few pounds a week. Doctor thinks the side effects I have had will diminish so I will be taking this for another month."
