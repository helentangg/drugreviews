"I have been on Cymbalta for about 7 months so far right and will continue to be on as instructed by my doctor. I am one of the luckiest who had no insomnia nor stomach problems because of it. I had bipolar and Cymbalta started to make me get better in its second week. The first week was slightly difficult, I had some cold hands and swinging mood struggles but they were pretty tolerable and went away fast. It&#039;s easy to focus on sports activities with it and it doesn&#039;t affect your nerve /muscle system badly. The withdrawal should be very carefully handled though because even when I forgot to take my pill one day, the next day I started having stomach and attention problems, low blood pressure and fatigue."
