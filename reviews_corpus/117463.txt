"This medication has been very effective by almost eliminating my daily pain. When I do experience headache, jaw and neck pain, it&#039;s now usually milder than before and easily treated with a pain reliever. 

Additional benefits include helping me fall asleep easier and reducing the symptoms of a serious sleep disorder.

The only negative side effect directly related to this med has been severe thirst requiring me to drink water and urinate very frequently. However this annoying and inconvenient side effect is well worth it.  I&#039;m also at high risk for angle closure, but am unsure if it&#039;s related.

I lived with chronic pain from my mid 20s through my late 30s before starting this medication. I only wish I started taking it earlier in life."
