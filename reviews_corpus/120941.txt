"I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression at 29 years old and was prescribed Effexor 37.5 mg. I stuck with the medication as I felt that any thing was better than what I was going through at the time. Eventually I found a good level dosage for me was 150 mg and have been on them for the last 6 years. I can say that Effexor has been a success for me. I wished that I was able to diagnose when I was even younger as my life would probably have swerved some bad life experiences. Now I am 36 with three kids and life is so amazing. I have still had some rough roads but the way I am able to process and handle them now vs before is a lot more efficient. I have not had a panic attack or a dip in my depression in 6 years. Life is good. Good is Great"
