"I have had anxeity and depression before.
I went on Paroxetine for it the first time and it was the worst experience of my life in the BEGINNING ONLY!! I was on that for 1 year then free from all of it for 2 years.

I have been going through PND which I never thought was possible for a male.... however thats what I got diagnosed with. I was terrifed to go back on SSRI due to the experiance I had last time.... However my Doc decided to make me try Zoloft and its honeslty fantastic. I started on .25 and have been moved up to 50mg to get the full effect of it. I am now happy and able to enjoy being a  new dad!!! My family needed me and thanks to Zoloft it saved us all.
My advice to beginners... give it time. It will save you!"
