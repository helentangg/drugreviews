"I wish I could put more than 10. This medicine saved me. I struggled for depression for 3 yrs. I didn&#039;t even know I had depression, everyone just told me it was probably my experiences that is making me feel down &amp; it takes time to get over these experiences. However, I felt like I was alone and numb because I couldn&#039;t get over it.I felt I was too sensitive to live in this world &amp; couldn&#039;t understand why there was always this heavy cloud over me. It kept getting worst and worst. I felt this was how my life would be forever. When I started taking this medication, it completely changed my life! I&#039;m so grateful everyday &amp; if I could turn back time I would have told myself to take it sooner. It was THE biggest change of my life for the better!"
