"I am in my late 40&#039;s.  Had bad mood dips for my whole life 3-5 days before my cycle.  Bad enough to think about divorce and feel that life was utterly black and hopeless every month, then swinging back to everything being fine a few days later.  I finally got up the guts to talk to a gyn about it.  Fluoxetine has changed my whole family life.  I finally feel able to reasonably handle the normal rhythm of things.  If any one wonders if their mood swings are bad enough to take something to help, I advise you to talk to your provider and give Prozac a try.  There is nothing to lose and everything to gain.  "
