"Guys I&#039;m 25 years old.....and  you can&#039;t imagine what the  hell I suffered from this depression and anxiety
1.confusion.
2.TREMENDOUS headache...I wasn&#039;t able to walk..
3.Panic attack, racing heart,chest pain..and the most terrible thing...Difficulties on breathing all the day ,no sleep. And all of this for 3 months !
But...I take Esram Escitalopram 20 mg for 1 year.....  1 mg Loram, I quit loram, used only 1 month. Now I&#039;m on 10 mg escitalopram. At the beginning I see no results , but after  2 month the things change dramatically...IT WORKED !! I&#039;m back now..full of energy...no more pain..never give up guys, do some exercise too...and listen to your neurolog doctor! I hope you get well soon..."
