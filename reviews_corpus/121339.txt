"Sadly only lasted 5 days on Effexor XR. The side effects from the 75mg dose was unlike anything I have experienced before. Within 10 hours of the first dose I had severe anxiety - something I had never experienced before. Within hours of second dose the extreme nausea came on. By day 3 I was pratically bed-ridden in cold sweats and feeling completely &quot;out of it&quot; . I persevered hoping the effects would begin to subside but by the 5th day I had severe nausea, couldn&#039;t get out of bed from feeling so sick, horrible tinnitus (ringing in the ears) and felt spaced out to the point that I began to wonder if I would ever feel &quot;normal&quot; again. Advised by GP to cease immediately on hearing my side effects."
