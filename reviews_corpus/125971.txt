"I&#039;ve been on Viibryd (40mg) for a few months now, for major depression/anxiety. Before that, I took Prozac, but I felt like it had stopped working. The Viibryd is working well for me. I have more good days. I don&#039;t feel sedated, just more positive and functional. As far as side effects, I get an upset stomach if I don&#039;t eat before I take it. I took it right before bed one time and had a really vivid nightmare, so I try to take it early in the day. When I do miss a dose, I feel withdrawal more than I did with Prozac. Overall, it&#039;s effective for me, but I have to be more careful to avoid side effects."
