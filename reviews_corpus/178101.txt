"I have chronic pain from a broken arm and two surgeries last year.  I&#039;ve tried EVERYTHING - this is the only non-narcotic medicine that has worked for me. The only negative is that it doesn&#039;t have a generic equivalent and my insurance doesn&#039;t cover it. That&#039;s a pretty big negative. "
