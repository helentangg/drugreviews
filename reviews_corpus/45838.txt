"I have been on fluoxetine for about 4 years. 
It has been most effective in eliminating low mood swings, panic attacks and even helps tame anger issues and irritability over the little stuff. Has enabled me to balance home and work life and be a reasonably good father of two and husband without driving everyone crazy. I&#039;m in my late 40&#039;s and would recommend it highly to anyone who constantly is confronted by overwhelming negative thoughts which inhibit enjoyment of daily life."
