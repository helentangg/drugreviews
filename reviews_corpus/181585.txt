"Prozac has changed my life. I&#039;ve suffered from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Anxiety, and Depression since I was in my pre-teens. I&#039;ve tried Celexa and Paxil, but couldn&#039;t sleep at all while using them. I asked my physician to prescribe Prozac on the advice of a friend and I&#039;ve had amazing results.  I started at 10 mg a day and increased to 20 mg a day after a month. I noticed that I was drowsy and unmotivated during the day when I took the medicine in the morning, so I switched to a bedtime dose and I haven&#039;t noticed any side effects since then. Prozac makes me calmer and much more in control of my fears. Others who didn&#039;t know I had gone on medication have noticed a positive change as well.  I&#039;ve been on Prozac for 4 months."
