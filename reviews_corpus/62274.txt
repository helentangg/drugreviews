"So far so good. I switched from escitalopram (Lexapro) to this to save money. I switched immediately, with no tapering off one drug to get on the next, and there were no problems. The effects are similar so far. I feel calmer, more focused, less irritable/agitated. I have a little bit of brain fog but nothing that keeps me from doing what I need to do. Hope it keeps working!"
