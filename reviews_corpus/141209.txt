"I am a 36 year old female. I have been on Lexapro for 4 months now, and It has definitely helped to change my life for the better.  I had crippling anxiety and depression, and finally went to the dr when it reached the point that I could not leave the house to go to work (some days) or even to the grocery store.  The first two weeks I took 10 mg/day and now I am on 20 mg/day.At first it made me sort of loopy and low sex drive but those things evened out.   I wish I would have started it sooner.  Please give this medicine a try if you have depression or anxiety."
