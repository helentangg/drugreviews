"I was experiencing very bad anxiety and was having panic attacks nearly everyday. I also had issues sleeping, I couldn&#039;t sleep more than 2 hours at a time. My doctor put me on 75mg once daily at bedtime. I feel like my old self. I am sleeping very well at night and I haven&#039;t had a panic attack in 8 months. Doxepin gave me my life back."
