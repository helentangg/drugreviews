"I take 50 mg of Trazodone and 1 mg of Risperdal for my racing thoughts and 40 mg of Celexa for my depression (all at bedtime) and this combination is really working well for me, I love it! I love love love this medicine. I used to have really bad depression that would cause me to become hospitalized for my suicidal ideation and now I rarely have those thoughts. This medicine has given me my life and happiness back. I am so glad to have finally found something that helps with my depression."
