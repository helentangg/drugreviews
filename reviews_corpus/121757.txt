"Day 4 of venlafaxine, 37.5mg at 6.30 am and 6.30pm. I have only just realised the importance of taking it at the same time if you are doing split doses. Previously I was taking as I woke up (5am) and before bed (10pm). Not good- headaches turned into full blown migraine. First dose I was sick immediately and was sweating, trembling slightly. I felt I could feel the chemicals literally swooshing around my brain and body. It was very strange. I calmed myself down, told myself to go with it. The rest of the day-fine. 
Day two, realized I had to EAT with the venlafaxine to ensure I wasn&#039;t sick. I&#039;ve never been a big eater, but half a banana with a venlafaxine plus milk in between bites was enough to line my stomach. Much better this time."
