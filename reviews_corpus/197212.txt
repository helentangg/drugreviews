"I have just weaned myself off, it has taken me about 2 months. Firstly I cut down to half a tablet for a month then half every other day. The side effects aren&#039;t great I felt a lot of vertigo, dizziness and headaches, but finally nearly 2 weeks and I am feeling great! I never in my life thought I would need tablets but sometimes we need a little help. Paroxetine has helped me get back to me. I tell people now its OK to ask for help. I am so glad that I did ask and have tried and now if I need them again in life I wouldn&#039;t hesitate."
