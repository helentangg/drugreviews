"After having my daughter last September, I fell into severe PPD and anxiety. I tried many types of meds, but had minimal if any relief and most left me more exhausted than I was to begin with. I started Pristiq Aug 6th of this year after having a DNA profile of the meds I could tolerate (not very many!) and with every week, I&#039;ve felt better. Every week (except for the first few weeks), I&#039;ve been able to look back and see how much I feel more like myself again and how much my anxiety has lessened. Almost 12 weeks since I began and I am very thankful for it. Remember, it&#039;s not a quick fix, no antidepressant is, it definitely took time."
