"I started this medication because I have struggled with depression, anxiety, and panic attacks.  I have been put on random depression meds since I was 14 years old and am now 24.  I&#039;ve tried lexapro, welbutrin, and a bunch of other stuff.  I never really saw improvement as a teenager on these drugs, but it could have been my hormones at the time.  I tried prosac at 23 years old and it seemed to make a real difference for me.  I think I started to feel the difference within the first week, but that might have been a placebo affect.  After at least 2-3 weeks is when I think it really started to work and I could feel a difference.  My anxiety levels started to drop pretty drastically and I was no longer afraid of things like the dark."
