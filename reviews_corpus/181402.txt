"Incredible. To think a simple pill would be so life changing. 21 year old married mother of two , I&#039;ve been struggling with depression and anxiety, especially social anxiety my entire life. I was at the end of my rope, starting to think depression wasn&#039;t even a real thing, it was just normal to feel like shit. Literally the first day I felt okay. A month later here I am exercising everyday in my spotless house and playing with my kids. No more emotional eating I&#039;ve lost fifteen freaking pounds I have the energy and focus to do EVERYTHING. I only wish I would have tried it sooner. I thought it would make me feel like a numb robot but I still feel like me, just a better me. Really looking forward to my future on Prozac."
