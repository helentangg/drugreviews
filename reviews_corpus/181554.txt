"I took Prozac for 15 years and it worked great for obsessive compulsive disorder!  About 3 years ago I started noticing &quot;mania&quot; where I couldn&#039;t sleep or sit still to even eat.  After seeing several different doctors who treated it with medication for ADHD or Bi-polar it was determined that it was a side effect to Prozac so I stopped taking Prozac and all the mania stopped. Google shows two side effects to Prozac are 1) can&#039;t sit still and 2) can&#039;t sleep at night.  I wanted to share this unusual experience to help any others who may be experiencing mania and can&#039;t figure out why.  If you too are on Prozac then it may be a side effect but check with your doctor. "
