"I&#039;ve been on fluoxetine for about 7 years or more now and I can tell you it has been the best decision I&#039;ve ever made. I was put on for OCD and depression as well as anxiety and the constant hand washing is a thing of the past! When on it I feel like a happier person wanting to do more things and have become more outgoing!
As like any medicine, there are side effects at first, but funnily enough I don&#039;t think I had any. Don&#039;t worry if you feel horrible when you first get on them, you sometimes have to go down to come all the way back up!"
