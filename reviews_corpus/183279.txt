"This is wonderful. I suffered from generalized anxiety for two and a half years. Eventually I slipped into severe depression, probably resulting from the chronic anxiety I was dealing with for so long. I have been on Cymbalta 60mg for a little over a month and I feel better than I ever have before. Before Cymbalta, I was on Paxil and Lexapro, which both did more harm than good. On Cymbalta I finally feel normal and my sleep has improved so much. I was a chronic insomniac and now I can usually sleep whenever I feel like it. I am so lucky that my psychiatrist decided to try me on this medicine. I would recommend trying this medicine to anyone suffering from anxiety &amp; depression."
