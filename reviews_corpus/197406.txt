"I thought I needed an antidepressant, so I tried a couple. Paxil for me had terrible side effects. I felt like I was on speed.  Had to eat every two hours. I could not go anywhere; always had to have snacks with me and I lost weight even with the calorie increase.  Insomnia was the worst.  I could not even take 10 mg.  I tried the medication for about 7 weeks and decided it was not for me and began a weaning off process.  Reduced to 5 mg for 1 week, this was the hardest and caused the most side effects which included vertigo, nausea and insomnia which lasted about 2 days.  Then I reduced to 2.5 mg for another week and a half.  Stopped taking it completely after this and did fine with no side effects."
