"I had been dealing with anxiety disorder and panic attacks for about one year. My doctor put me on Prozac - which gave short term relief but then terrible panic attacks. Since going on Zoloft I have seen a 100% decrease in panic attacks and anxiety. This medicine worked for me when nothing else would."
