"Please everyone make sure you are emailing Pfizer. They need to be making increments of 5mg so that people can wean themselves off easier. They are aware of the withdrawal from Effexor yet have not made smaller increments so people have to figure out ways to do it themselves.  I was on 150mg for 4 years. I attempted to go off by decreasing by 37.5mg every 2 weeks. I was suicidal, exhausted, dizzy, and felt like my brain was being electrocuted.  Within 2 days of taking my previous dose the symptoms went away.  My next attempt to get off was much slower. I decreased by 5mg every month.  I had to take my pills out of the capsule, shave a little off the pill and put it back in the capsule.  To get any kind of accuracy you have to buy a scale."
