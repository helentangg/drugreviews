"I&#039;ve only experienced two side effects while taking this medication: lethargy, which is intermittent, and prolonged orgasm - which I enjoy.  It does it&#039;s job, making emotions much easier to control.  I thought taking this would make me happy all the time, but I didn&#039;t notice anything like a &quot;switch&quot; going on or off.  I&#039;m glad, I still have emotions, they are just more muted - the bad ones.  Again, love this medicine for it&#039;s ability to prolong ejaculation."
