"I just started Zoloft 2 weeks ago and have noticed an immense change in how I&#039;ve been feeling. I used to be very sad and anxious about my relationship that ended badly, and I would binge eat lots of bread and bagels. Since taking it, I&#039;ve had this new outlook on life.... I&#039;ve been content with everything. A simple inner peace. I used to be obsessive about my weight (combined with the binge eating, it was a messy combination.) but since then I&#039;ve been able to eat balanced and not even weigh myself (used to weigh myself compulsively) I&#039;ve had greater self confidence and wake up every morning excited for my day. I no longer have the crazy anxieties I used to about getting crazy life threatening illnesses. zoloft has been incredible for me."
