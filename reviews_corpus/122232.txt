"I have depression, anxiety and stress caused by my workplace. I have noticed that for the first time I can actually enjoy going to work. Before this medicine I used to cry and shake in bed before work, and my poor husband had to drive me there like I was a little kid going through withdrawals from parents. I&#039;ve noticed I don&quot;t &quot;freak&quot; out as much, and the best thing is my anti-medication&quot; husband calls Effexor XR a &quot;miracle pill&quot;. The only side effects I&#039;ve noticed are extreme racing thoughts, and night sweats."
