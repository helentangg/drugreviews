"I started taking Effexor XR 4 months ago.  My entire life I&#039;ve struggled with anxiety.  I have gone to cognitive behavioral therapy to help me change my responses to anxiety producing situations, all to know avail.  I never wanted to take medication as I thought only weak people do that.  About 2 months prior to taking Effexor XR I began having panic attacks so severe I felt as though I was going to die.  I couldn&#039;t function and became depressed.  As a last resort I decided to try medication.  I take one 75mg capsule every morning. Please note, the 1st 2 weeks were misery - I could barely lift my head or body, I had neck pain and slept constantly and still had anxiety. I stuck it out and haven&#039;t had an anxiety or panic attack since then."
