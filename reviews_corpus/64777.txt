"Horrible reaction to Zoloft , ended up in the ER after 5 doses(12.5 mg) . That morning I awoke at 5 am sweating , achy, nauseous , heart racing, could barely walk legs hurt so bad. It&#039;s been 3 1/2 weeks since I stopped it and I still have pain in hips and muscle aches / burning sensation in legs and constant chest pain from palpitations."
