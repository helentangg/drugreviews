"I was diagnosed with depression after a serious suicide attempt in February 2008.  I eventually went to my doctor in March 2008 and was prescribed fluoxetine.  I initially started on one tablet per day, which later was increased to two tablets a day (40mg)and I have seen such a difference.  I still have my up and down days, but taking this medication has made me enjoy the good days more.  I have more motivation, however can be slightly tired and glazed over at times!  One thing I have noticed which my doctor hadn&#039;t heard of as an effect was dilated pupils, which can look a bit odd. But otherwise it has saved me from myself."
