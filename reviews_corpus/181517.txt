"Prozac saved me! I&#039;ve been in and out of hospitals for 10 years. Was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder. After changing Doctors and medicines I finally feel like myself again. I here no voices of worry and stress. I&#039;m not irritated over the slightest things. I can now think clearer. After months of depression and panic attracts my new doctor recommended Prozac. For weeks I felt nausea and weakness. Then on the third week I got up and out and got a job the same day! I was no longer stuttering and confused. My relationship with my significant other is 100% better. My thoughts were very clear. I&#039;d finally gained my confidence back! I&#039;m very happy I tried Prozac. I feel amazing."
