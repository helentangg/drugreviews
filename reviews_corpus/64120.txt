"My Dr. prescribed sertraline to manage my OCD and anxiety. I&#039;m a 35 y/o grad student with test anxiety and my OCD has been getting worse over the years. The first day I felt slightly better but the medication made me yawn a lot. After talking it I pulled an all-nighter to study for an exam. After the exam I figured I would go home and sleep but as tired as I was, I couldn&#039;t fall asleep. On night two I tossed and turned all night. On day three my skin felt too tight and I felt like I needed to stretch out my jaw and neck all day. On night three I couldn&#039;t fall asleep at all and had a weird experience like my body was awake but I couldn&#039;t move or yell for help. It was horrible. After I told my dr. she took me off of it."
